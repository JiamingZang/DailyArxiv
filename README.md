| **[Learning Point Cloud Representations with Pose Continuity for Depth-Based Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14358v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25 benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world applications.

| **[MR6D: Benchmarking 6D Pose Estimation for Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13775v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators, interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/anas-gouda/mr6d.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted CVPR 2025 Workshop on Recovering 6D Object Pose (R6D)</p></details> |
| **[RCGNet: RGB-based Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation with Geometric Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13623v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally, we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.</p></details> | Accepted by IROS2025 |
| **[Novel Object 6D Pose Estimation with a Single Reference View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05578v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing novel object 6D pose estimation methods typically rely on CAD models or dense reference views, which are both difficult to acquire. Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in a common coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative object-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting. Code will be released at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/SinRef-6D.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures (including supplementary material)</p></details> |
| **[Level-Set Parameters: Novel Representation for 3D Shape Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13502v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D shape analysis has been largely focused on traditional 3D representations of point clouds and meshes, but the discrete nature of these data makes the analysis susceptible to variations in input resolutions. Recent development of neural fields brings in level-set parameters from signed distance functions as a novel, continuous, and numerical representation of 3D shapes, where the shape surfaces are defined as zero-level-sets of those functions. This motivates us to extend shape analysis from the traditional 3D data to these novel parameter data. Since the level-set parameters are not Euclidean like point clouds, we establish correlations across different shapes by formulating them as a pseudo-normal distribution, and learn the distribution prior from the respective dataset. To further explore the level-set parameters with shape transformations, we propose to condition a subset of these parameters on rotations and translations, and generate them with a hypernetwork. This simplifies the pose-related shape analysis compared to using traditional data. We demonstrate the promise of the novel representations through applications in shape classification (arbitrary poses), retrieval, and 6D object pose estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask6D: Masked Pose Priors For 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06486v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous end-to-end pose estimation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2024. 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[SenseShift6D: Multimodal RGB-D Benchmarking for Robust 6D Pose Estimation across Environment and Sensor Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05751v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures, 9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels. For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire 101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive, self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain real-world environments. Our dataset is available at: huggingface.co/datasets/Yegyu/SenseShift6D Associated scripts can be found at: github.com/yegyu-han/SenseShift6D</p></details> |  |
| **[Computer Vision for Objects used in Group Work: Challenges and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00224v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive and spatially aware technologies are transforming educational frameworks, particularly in K-12 settings where hands-on exploration fosters deeper conceptual understanding. However, during collaborative tasks, existing systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale. This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods' object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results, and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AIED 2025 Late Breaking Results Track</p></details> |
| **[Monocular One-Shot Metric-Depth Alignment for RGB-Based Robot Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17110v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision, which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras), and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[XYZ-IBD: A High-precision Bin-picking Dataset for Object 6D Pose Estimation Capturing Real-world Industrial Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00599v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce XYZ-IBD, a bin-picking dataset for 6D pose estimation that captures real-world industrial complexity, including challenging object geometries, reflective materials, severe occlusions, and dense clutter. The dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on household objects, which approach saturation,XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved realistic industrial conditions. The dataset features 15 texture-less, metallic, and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density, replicating the challenges of real-world bin-picking. XYZ-IBD was collected using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view real-world scenes, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks. By capturing the complexity of real-world bin-picking scenarios, XYZ-IBD introduces more realistic and challenging problems for future research. The dataset and benchmark are publicly available at https://xyz-ibd.github.io/XYZ-IBD/.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Hand Object Pose Estimation via Visual-Tactile Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10787v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate in-hand pose estimation is crucial for robotic object manipulation, but visual occlusion remains a major challenge for vision-based approaches. This paper presents an approach to robotic in-hand object pose estimation, combining visual and tactile information to accurately determine the position and orientation of objects grasped by a robotic hand. We address the challenge of visual occlusion by fusing visual information from a wrist-mounted RGB-D camera with tactile information from vision-based tactile sensors mounted on the fingertips of a robotic gripper. Our approach employs a weighting and sensor fusion module to combine point clouds from heterogeneous sensor types and control each modality's contribution to the pose estimation process. We use an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm adapted for weighted point clouds to estimate the 6D object pose. Our experiments show that incorporating tactile information significantly improves pose estimation accuracy, particularly when occlusion is high. Our method achieves an average pose estimation error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only baselines by up to 20%. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to perform precise object manipulation in a real-world insertion task.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Accurate and efficient zero-shot 6D pose estimation with frozen foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09784v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable 8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[CHIP: A multi-sensor dataset for 6D pose estimation of chairs in industrial settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09699v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D pose estimation of complex objects in 3D environments is essential for effective robotic manipulation. Yet, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating 6D pose estimation methods under realistic industrial conditions, as most datasets focus on household objects in domestic settings, while the few available industrial datasets are limited to artificial setups with objects placed on tables. To bridge this gap, we introduce CHIP, the first dataset designed for 6D pose estimation of chairs manipulated by a robotic arm in a real-world industrial environment. CHIP includes seven distinct chairs captured using three different RGBD sensing technologies and presents unique challenges, such as distractor objects with fine-grained differences and severe occlusions caused by the robotic arm and human operators. CHIP comprises 77,811 RGBD images annotated with ground-truth 6D poses automatically derived from the robot's kinematics, averaging 11,115 annotations per chair. We benchmark CHIP using three zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods, assessing performance across different sensor types, localization priors, and occlusion levels. Results show substantial room for improvement, highlighting the unique challenges posed by the dataset. CHIP will be publicly released.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[UA-Pose: Uncertainty-Aware 6D Object Pose Estimation and Online Object Completion with Partial References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07996v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects. However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed 3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating 6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are incomplete or partially captured.

| **[You Only Estimate Once: Unified, One-stage, Real-Time Category-level Articulated Object 6D Pose Estimation for Robotic Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05719v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[MTevent: A Multi-Task Event Camera Dataset for 6D Pose Estimation and Moving Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11282v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots are reaching unprecedented speeds, with platforms like Unitree B2, and Fraunhofer O3dyn achieving maximum speeds between 5 and 10 m/s. However, effectively utilizing such speeds remains a challenge due to the limitations of RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and fail to provide real-time responsiveness. Event cameras, with their asynchronous operation, and low-latency sensing, offer a promising alternative for high-speed robotic perception. In this work, we introduce MTevent, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation and moving object detection in highly dynamic environments with large detection distances. Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an RGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16 unique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles, varying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine high-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions, making it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To establish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's FoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with ground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in such dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve perception models and foster further research in high-speed robotic vision.

The vast majority of existing methods rely on instance-specific CAD models or require depth sensors to resolve geometric ambiguities, making them impractical for real-world agricultural applications. In this work, we introduce PLANTPose, a novel framework for category-level 6D pose estimation that operates purely on RGB input. PLANTPose predicts both the 6D pose and deformation parameters relative to a base mesh, allowing a single category-level CAD model to adapt to unseen instances. This enables accurate pose estimation across varying shapes without relying on instance-specific data. To enhance realism and improve generalization, we also leverage Stable Diffusion to refine synthetic training images with realistic texturing, mimicking variations due to ripeness and environmental factors and bridging the domain gap between synthetic data and the real world. Our evaluations on a challenging benchmark that includes bananas of various shapes, sizes, and ripeness status demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in handling large intraclass variations while maintaining accurate 6D pose predictions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art RGB-based approach MegaPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

| **[RefPose: Leveraging Reference Geometric Correspondences for Accurate 6D Pose Estimation of Unseen Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10841v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of unseen objects from monocular RGB images remains a challenging problem, especially due to the lack of prior object-specific knowledge. To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to object pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric correspondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using object templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric correspondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage, RefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the generated references and iteratively refines the pose through a render-and-compare approach. To enhance this estimation, we introduce a correlation volume-guided attention mechanism that effectively captures correlations between the query and reference images. Unlike traditional methods that depend on pre-defined object models, RefPose dynamically adapts to new object shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence. This results in robust performance across previously unseen objects. Extensive evaluation on the BOP benchmark datasets shows that RefPose achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining a competitive runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

These requirements make generalization to novel objects difficult for which neither 3D models nor multi-view images may be available. To address this, we propose a novel method One2Any that estimates the relative 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) object pose using only a single reference-single query RGB-D image, without prior knowledge of its 3D model, multi-view data, or category constraints. We treat object pose estimation as an encoding-decoding process, first, we obtain a comprehensive Reference Object Pose Embedding (ROPE) that encodes an object shape, orientation, and texture from a single reference view. Using this embedding, a U-Net-based pose decoding module produces Reference Object Coordinate (ROC) for new views, enabling fast and accurate pose estimation. This simple encoding-decoding framework allows our model to be trained on any pair-wise pose data, enabling large-scale training and demonstrating great scalability. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model generalizes well to novel objects, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness even rivaling methods that require multi-view or CAD inputs, at a fraction of compute.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Category-Level and Open-Set Object Pose Estimation for Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19572v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation enables a variety of tasks in computer vision and robotics, including scene understanding and robotic grasping. The complexity of a pose estimation task depends on the unknown variables related to the target object. While instance-level methods already excel for opaque and Lambertian objects, category-level and open-set methods, where texture, shape, and size are partially or entirely unknown, still struggle with these basic material properties. Since texture is unknown in these scenarios, it cannot be used for disambiguating object symmetries, another core challenge of 6D object pose estimation. The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of unknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions. This paper compares datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithms for solving 6D pose estimation on the category-level. Based on this comparison, we analyze how to bridge category-level and open-set object pose estimation to reach generalization and provide actionable recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Austrian Robotics Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[CordViP: Correspondence-based Visuomotor Policy for Dexterous Manipulation in Real-World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08449v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving human-level dexterity in robots is a key objective in the field of robotic manipulation. Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have shown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal. However, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems: (1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is significantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and occlusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack crucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations, we propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns correspondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and robot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware point clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand. These point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also incorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in six real-world tasks, surpassing other baselines by a large margin. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness of CordViP to different objects, viewpoints, and scenarios.

In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have similar rankings on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21--29% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still -35% behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023), and the 2D detection stage is consequently the main bottleneck of existing pipelines for 6D localization/detection of unseen objects. The online evaluation system stays open and is available at http://bop.felk.cvut.cz/</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.09799</p></details> |

While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Most recent 6D object pose methods rely on refinement to get accurate results. However, most existing refinement methods either suffer from noises in establishing correspondences, or rely on retraining for novel objects. SCFlow2 is based on the SCFlow model designed for refinement with shape constraint, but formulates the additional depth as a regularization in the iteration via 3D scene flow for RGBD frames. The key design of SCFlow2 is an introduction of geometry constraints into the training of recurrent matching network, by combining the rigid-motion embeddings in 3D scene flow and 3D shape prior of the target. We train SCFlow2 on a combination of dataset Objaverse, GSO and ShapeNet, and evaluate on BOP datasets with novel objects. After using our method as a post-processing, most state-of-the-art methods produce significantly better results, without any retraining or fine-tuning.

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Vanishing Depth, a self-supervised training approach that extends pretrained RGB encoders to incorporate and align metric depth into their feature embeddings. Based on our novel positional depth encoding, we enable stable depth density and depth distribution invariant feature extraction. We achieve performance improvements and SOTA results across a spectrum of relevant RGBD downstream tasks - without the necessity of finetuning the encoder. Most notably, we achieve 56.05 mIoU on SUN-RGBD segmentation, 88.3 RMSE on Void's depth completion, and 83.8 Top 1 accuracy on NYUv2 scene classification. In 6D-object pose estimation, we outperform our predecessors of DinoV2, EVA-02, and Omnivore and achieve SOTA results for non-finetuned encoders in several related RGBD downstream tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Unlike existing methods that rely on textured 3D models or multiple viewpoints, Any6D leverages a joint object alignment process to enhance 2D-3D alignment and metric scale estimation for improved pose accuracy. Our approach integrates a render-and-compare strategy to generate and refine pose hypotheses, enabling robust performance in scenarios with occlusions, non-overlapping views, diverse lighting conditions, and large cross-environment variations. We evaluate our method on five challenging datasets: REAL275, Toyota-Light, HO3D, YCBINEOAT, and LM-O, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods for novel object pose estimation.

| **[GDRNPP: A Geometry-guided and Fully Learning-based Object Pose Estimator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12145v5)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D pose estimation of rigid objects is a long-standing and challenging task in computer vision. Recently, the emergence of deep learning reveals the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict reliable 6D poses. Given that direct pose regression networks currently exhibit suboptimal performance, most methods still resort to traditional techniques to varying degrees. For example, top-performing methods often adopt an indirect strategy by first establishing 2D-3D or 3D-3D correspondences followed by applying the RANSAC-based PnP or Kabsch algorithms, and further employing ICP for refinement. Despite the performance enhancement, the integration of traditional techniques makes the networks time-consuming and not end-to-end trainable. Orthogonal to them, this paper introduces a fully learning-based object pose estimator. In this work, we first perform an in-depth investigation of both direct and indirect methods and propose a simple yet effective Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDRN) to learn the 6D pose from monocular images in an end-to-end manner. Afterwards, we introduce a geometry-guided pose refinement module, enhancing pose accuracy when extra depth data is available. Guided by the predicted coordinate map, we build an end-to-end differentiable architecture that establishes robust and accurate 3D-3D correspondences between the observed and rendered RGB-D images to refine the pose. Our enhanced pose estimation pipeline GDRNPP (GDRN Plus Plus) conquered the leaderboard of the BOP Challenge for two consecutive years, becoming the first to surpass all prior methods that relied on traditional techniques in both accuracy and speed.

Recent advancements have expanded this estimation from instance-level to category-level, allowing models to generalize across unseen instances within the same category. However, this generalization is limited by the narrow range of categories covered by existing datasets, such as NOCS, which also tend to overlook common real-world challenges like occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Omni6D, a comprehensive RGBD dataset featuring a wide range of categories and varied backgrounds, elevating the task to a more realistic context. 1) The dataset comprises an extensive spectrum of 166 categories, 4688 instances adjusted to the canonical pose, and over 0.8 million captures, significantly broadening the scope for evaluation. 2) We introduce a symmetry-aware metric and conduct systematic benchmarks of existing algorithms on Omni6D, offering a thorough exploration of new challenges and insights. 3) Additionally, we propose an effective fine-tuning approach that adapts models from previous datasets to our extensive vocabulary setting. We believe this initiative will pave the way for new insights and substantial progress in both the industrial and academic fields, pushing forward the boundaries of general 6D pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 (poster).

| **[LuciBot: Automated Robot Policy Learning from Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09871v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generating training supervision for embodied tasks is crucial, as manual designing is tedious and not scalable. While prior works use large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rewards, these approaches are largely limited to simple tasks with well-defined rewards, such as pick-and-place. This limitation arises because LLMs struggle to interpret complex scenes compressed into text or code due to their restricted input modality, while VLM-based rewards, though better at visual perception, remain limited by their less expressive output modality. To address these challenges, we leverage the imagination capability of general-purpose video generation models. Given an initial simulation frame and a textual task description, the video generation model produces a video demonstrating task completion with correct semantics. We then extract rich supervisory signals from the generated video, including 6D object pose sequences, 2D segmentations, and estimated depth, to facilitate task learning in simulation. Our approach significantly improves supervision quality for complex embodied tasks, enabling large-scale training in simulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal 3D Mesh Reconstruction from Images and Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07190v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation for unseen objects is essential in robotics but traditionally relies on trained models that require large datasets, high computational costs, and struggle to generalize. Zero-shot approaches eliminate the need for training but depend on pre-existing 3D object models, which are often impractical to obtain. To address this, we propose a language-guided few-shot 3D reconstruction method, reconstructing a 3D mesh from few input images. In the proposed pipeline, receives a set of input images and a language query. A combination of GroundingDINO and Segment Anything Model outputs segmented masks from which a sparse point cloud is reconstructed with VGGSfM. Subsequently, the mesh is reconstructed with the Gaussian Splatting method SuGAR. In a final cleaning step, artifacts are removed, resulting in the final 3D mesh of the queried object. We evaluate the method in terms of accuracy and quality of the geometry and texture. Furthermore, we study the impact of imaging conditions such as viewing angle, number of input images, and image overlap on 3D object reconstruction quality, efficiency, and computational scalability.</p></details> | under review |
| **[AxisPose: Model-Free Matching-Free Single-Shot 6D Object Pose Estimation via Axis Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06660v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation, which plays a vital role in robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving, has been of great interest in computer vision. Existing studies either require multi-stage pose regression or rely on 2D-3D feature matching. Though these approaches have shown promising results, they rely heavily on appearance information, requiring complex input (i.e., multi-view reference input, depth, or CAD models) and intricate pipeline (i.e., feature extraction-SfM-2D to 3D matching-PnP). We propose AxisPose, a model-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation, which fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing methods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM and PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by leveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects without reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation Module (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes through a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the gradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain the geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated tri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module (TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose achieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N instances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with great potential for generalization to unseen-object level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active 6D Pose Estimation for Textureless Objects using Multi-View RGB Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03726v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of textureless objects from RBG images is an important problem in robotics. Due to appearance ambiguities, rotational symmetries, and severe occlusions, single-view based 6D pose estimators are still unable to handle a wide range of objects, motivating research towards multi-view pose estimation and next-best-view prediction that addresses these limitations. In this work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for estimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our approach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a sequential two-step process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency. First, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth ambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify the subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through canonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then introduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera viewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty and enhancing pose accuracy. We evaluate our method on the public ROBI dataset as well as on a transparent object dataset that we created. When evaluated using the same camera viewpoints, our multi-view pose estimation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by leveraging our next-best-view strategy, our method achieves high object pose accuracy with substantially fewer viewpoints than heuristic-based policies.</p></details> |  |

We set out to improve the state-of-the-art by addressing challenges such as reflections and specular highlights in industrial applications. Our novel BOP-compatible dataset, featuring a diverse set of metallic objects (cans, household, and industrial items) under various lighting and background conditions, provides additional geometric and visual cues. We demonstrate that these cues can be effectively leveraged to enhance overall performance. To illustrate the usefulness of the additional features, we improve upon the GDRNPP algorithm by introducing an additional keypoint prediction and material estimator head in order to improve spatial scene understanding. Evaluations on the new dataset show improved accuracy for metallic objects, supporting the hypothesis that additional geometric and visual cues can improve learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Increasing the Task Flexibility of Heavy-Duty Manipulators Using Visual 6D Pose Estimation of Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19169v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in visual 6D pose estimation of objects using deep neural networks have enabled novel ways of vision-based control for heavy-duty robotic applications. In this study, we present a pipeline for the precise tool positioning of heavy-duty, long-reach (HDLR) manipulators using advanced machine vision. A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration to estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI). Based on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with motion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool positioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and control methods prevalent in the industry. The proposed methodology comprises orientation and position alignment based on the visually estimated OOI poses, whereas camera-to-robot calibration is conducted based on motion utilizing visual SLAM. The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from rigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via image-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation, only synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world setting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results demonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2 mm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to increase the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR manipulators.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances improving speed and accuracy in pose estimation, finding a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy poses significant challenges in dynamic environments. Most current algorithms lack scalability in estimation time, especially for diverse datasets, and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are often too slow. This study focuses on developing a fast and scalable set of pose estimators based on GDRNPP to meet or exceed current benchmarks in accuracy and robustness, particularly addressing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off essential in real-time scenarios. We propose the AMIS algorithm to tailor the utilized model according to an application-specific trade-off between inference time and accuracy. We further show the effectiveness of the AMIS-based model choice on four prominent benchmark datasets (LM-O, YCB-V, T-LESS, and ITODD).</p></details> |  |

While existing methods can estimate the precise 6D pose of objects, they heavily rely on curated CAD models or reference images, the preparation of which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, 3D models or reference images may not be available in advance and instant robot reaction is desired. In this work, we propose a novel framework named HIPPo, which eliminates the need for curated CAD models and reference images by harnessing image-to-3D priors from Diffusion Models, enabling model-free zero-shot 6D pose estimation. Specifically, we construct HIPPo Dreamer, a rapid image-to-mesh model built on a multiview Diffusion Model and a 3D reconstruction foundation model. Our HIPPo Dreamer can generate a 3D mesh of any unseen objects from a single glance in just a few seconds. Then, as more observations are acquired, we propose to continuously refine the diffusion prior mesh model by joint optimization of object geometry and appearance. This is achieved by a measurement-guided scheme that gradually replaces the plausible diffusion priors with more reliable online observations. Consequently, HIPPo can instantly estimate and track the 6D pose of a novel object and maintain a complete mesh for immediate robotic applications. Thorough experiments on various benchmarks show that HIPPo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 6D object pose estimation when prior reference images are limited.</p></details> |  |

Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC.

However, they present a major challenge due to their distinct refractive and reflective properties when it comes to accurately estimating the 6D pose. To solve this, we present ReFlow6D, a novel method for transparent object 6D pose estimation that harnesses the refractive-intermediate representation. Unlike conventional approaches, our method leverages a feature space impervious to changes in RGB image space and independent of depth information. Drawing inspiration from image matting, we model the deformation of the light path through transparent objects, yielding a unique object-specific intermediate representation guided by light refraction that is independent of the environment in which objects are observed. By integrating these intermediate features into the pose estimation network, we show that ReFlow6D achieves precise 6D pose estimation of transparent objects, using only RGB images as input. Our method further introduces a novel transparent object compositing loss, fostering the generation of superior refractive-intermediate features. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TOD and Trans32K-6D datasets. Robot grasping experiments further demonstrate that ReFlow6D's pose estimation accuracy effectively translates to real-world robotics task.

Existing real-world datasets primarily focus on table-top grasping scenarios, where a robot arm is placed in a fixed position and the objects are centralized within the FOV of fixed external camera(s). Assessing performance on such datasets may not accurately reflect the challenges encountered in everyday grasping and mobile manipulation tasks within kitchen environments such as retrieving objects from higher shelves, sinks, dishwashers, ovens, refrigerators, or microwaves. To address this gap, we present KITchen, a novel benchmark designed specifically for estimating the 6D poses of objects located in diverse positions within kitchen settings. For this purpose, we recorded a comprehensive dataset comprising around 205k real-world RGBD images for 111 kitchen objects captured in two distinct kitchens, utilizing a humanoid robot with its egocentric perspectives. Subsequently, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline, to streamline the labeling process of such datasets, resulting in the generation of 2D object labels, 2D object segmentation masks, and 6D object poses with minimal human effort. The benchmark, the dataset, and the annotation pipeline will be publicly available at https://kitchen-dataset.github.io/KITchen.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publishing at The 2024 IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots</p></details> |

Our approach relies on the evaluation of discrepancies in the geometry of the observed object, in particular its respective estimated back-projection in 3D, against a putative functional shape representation comprising mixtures of Gaussian Processes, that act as a template. Each Gaussian Process is trained to yield a fragment of the object's surface in a radial fashion with respect to designated reference points. We further define a pose confidence measure as the average probability of pixel back-projections in the Gaussian mixture. The goal of our experiments is two-fold. a) We demonstrate that our functional representation is sufficiently accurate as a shape template on which the probability of back-projected object points can be evaluated, and, b) we show that the resulting confidence scores based on these probabilities are indeed a consistent quality measure of pose.</p></details> |  |

Most current approaches are restricted to specific instances with known models or require ground truth depth information or point cloud captures from LIDAR. We tackle the harder problem of pose estimation for category-level objects from a single RGB image. We propose a novel solution that eliminates the need for specific object models or depth information. Our method utilises score-based diffusion models to generate object pose hypotheses to model the distribution of possible poses for the object. Unlike previous methods that rely on costly trained likelihood estimators to remove outliers before pose aggregation using mean pooling, we introduce a simpler approach using Mean Shift to estimate the mode of the distribution as the final pose estimate. Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the REAL275 dataset by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

It is particularly challenging in bin-picking applications, where objects may be textureless and in difficult poses, and occlusion between objects of the same type may cause confusion even in well-trained models. We propose a novel method of hard example synthesis that is model-agnostic, using existing simulators and the modeling of pose error in both the camera-to-object viewsphere and occlusion space. Through evaluation of the model performance with respect to the distribution of object poses and occlusions, we discover regions of high error and generate realistic training samples to specifically target these regions. With our training approach, we demonstrate an improvement in correct detection rate of up to 20% across several ROBI-dataset objects using state-of-the-art pose estimation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Particle-based 6D Object Pose Estimation from Point Clouds using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00835v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation from a single view remains a challenging problem. In particular, partial observability, occlusions, and object symmetries eventually result in pose ambiguity. To account for this multimodality, this work proposes training a diffusion-based generative model for 6D object pose estimation. During inference, the trained generative model allows for sampling multiple particles, i.e., pose hypotheses. To distill this information into a single pose estimate, we propose two novel and effective pose selection strategies that do not require any additional training or computationally intensive operations. Moreover, while many existing methods for pose estimation primarily focus on the image domain and only incorporate depth information for final pose refinement, our model solely operates on point cloud data. The model thereby leverages recent advancements in point cloud processing and operates upon an SE(3)-equivariant latent space that forms the basis for the particle selection strategies and allows for improved inference times. Our thorough experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach on the Linemod dataset and showcase the effectiveness of our design choices.

Occlusion and incomplete object visibility are common challenges in this task, but existing pose refinement methods often struggle to handle these issues effectively. To tackle this problem, we propose a global motion-guided recurrent flow estimation method called GMFlow for pose estimation. GMFlow overcomes local ambiguities caused by occlusion or missing parts by seeking global explanations. We leverage the object's structural information to extend the motion of visible parts of the rigid body to its invisible regions. Specifically, we capture global contextual information through a linear attention mechanism and guide local motion information to generate global motion estimates. Furthermore, we introduce object shape constraints in the flow iteration process, making flow estimation suitable for pose estimation scenarios. Experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in accuracy while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GS2Pose: Two-stage 6D Object Pose Estimation Guided by Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03807v3)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a new method for accurate and robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects, named GS2Pose. By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose can utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD model, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input. Specifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse estimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight U-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is designed. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images. GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly competitive results. The code for GS2Pose will soon be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Existing 6D pose estimation networks are often too large for such deployments, necessitating compression while maintaining reliable performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Modular Quantization-Aware Training (MQAT), an adaptive and mixed-precision quantization-aware training strategy that exploits the modular structure of modern 6D pose estimation architectures. MQAT guides a systematic gradated modular quantization sequence and determines module-specific bit precisions, leading to quantized models that outperform those produced by state-of-the-art uniform and mixed-precision quantization techniques. Our experiments showcase the generality of MQAT across datasets, architectures, and quantization algorithms. Remarkably, MQAT-trained quantized models achieve a significant accuracy boost (>7%) over the baseline full-precision network while reducing model size by a factor of 4x or more.

| **[ZeroPose: CAD-Prompted Zero-shot Object 6D Pose Estimation in Cluttered Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17934v3)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robotics and industry applications have a high demand for the capability to estimate the 6D pose of novel objects from the cluttered scene. However, existing classic pose estimation methods are object-specific, which can only handle the specific objects seen during training. When applied to a novel object, these methods necessitate a cumbersome onboarding process, which involves extensive dataset preparation and model retraining. The extensive duration and resource consumption of onboarding limit their practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce ZeroPose, a novel zero-shot framework that performs pose estimation following a Discovery-Orientation-Registration (DOR) inference pipeline. This framework generalizes to novel objects without requiring model retraining. Given the CAD model of a novel object, ZeroPose enables in seconds onboarding time to extract visual and geometric embeddings from the CAD model as a prompt. With the prompting of the above embeddings, DOR can discover all related instances and estimate their 6D poses without additional human interaction or presupposing scene conditions. Compared with existing zero-shot methods solved by the render-and-compare paradigm, the DOR pipeline formulates the object pose estimation into a feature-matching problem, which avoids time-consuming online rendering and improves efficiency. Experimental results on the seven datasets show that ZeroPose as a zero-shot method achieves comparable performance with object-specific training methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot method with 50x inference speed improvement.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a technical description of the European Space Agency's (ESA) project "AI for AR in Satellite AIT," which combines real-time computer vision and AR systems to assist technicians during satellite assembly. Leveraging Microsoft HoloLens 2 as the AR interface, the system delivers context-aware instructions and real-time feedback, tackling the complexities of object recognition and 6D pose estimation in AIT workflows. All AI models demonstrated over 70% accuracy, with the detection model exceeding 95% accuracy, indicating a high level of performance and reliability. A key contribution of this work lies in the effective use of synthetic data for training AI models in AR applications, addressing the significant challenges of obtaining real-world datasets in highly dynamic satellite environments, as well as the creation of the Segmented Anything Model for Automatic Labelling (SAMAL), which facilitates the automatic annotation of real data, achieving speeds up to 20 times faster than manual human annotation. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of AI-driven AR systems in automating critical satellite assembly tasks, setting a foundation for future innovations in the space industry.</p></details> |  |

This problem is of particular interest for many practical applications in industrial tasks such as quality control, bin picking, and robotic manipulation, where both speed and accuracy are critical for real-world deployment. Current models, both classical and deep-learning-based, often struggle with the trade-off between accuracy and latency. Our research focuses on enhancing the speed of a prominent state-of-the-art deep learning model, GDRNPP, while keeping its high accuracy. We employ several techniques to reduce the model size and improve inference time. These techniques include using smaller and quicker backbones, pruning unnecessary parameters, and distillation to transfer knowledge from a large, high-performing model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed configuration maintains accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art while significantly improving inference time. This advancement could lead to more efficient and practical applications in various industrial scenarios, thereby enhancing the overall applicability of 6D Object Pose Estimation models in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Probabilistic Geometry-Guided Regression for 6DoF Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11819v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation is the problem of identifying the position and orientation of an object relative to a chosen coordinate system, which is a core technology for modern XR applications. State-of-the-art 6D object pose estimators directly predict an object pose given an object observation. Due to the ill-posed nature of the pose estimation problem, where multiple different poses can correspond to a single observation, generating additional plausible estimates per observation can be valuable. To address this, we reformulate the state-of-the-art algorithm GDRNPP and introduce EPRO-GDR (End-to-End Probabilistic Geometry-Guided Regression). Instead of predicting a single pose per detection, we estimate a probability density distribution of the pose. Using the evaluation procedure defined by the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) Challenge, we test our approach on four of its core datasets and demonstrate superior quantitative results for EPRO-GDR on LM-O, YCB-V, and ITODD. Our probabilistic solution shows that predicting a pose distribution instead of a single pose can improve state-of-the-art single-view pose estimation while providing the additional benefit of being able to sample multiple meaningful pose candidates.</p></details> |  |

However, recent methods for directly regressing poses from RGB images using dense features have achieved state-of-the-art results. Stereo vision, which provides an additional perspective on the object, can help reduce pose ambiguity and occlusion. Moreover, stereo can directly infer the distance of an object, while mono-vision requires internalized knowledge of the object's size. To extend the state-of-the-art in 6D object pose estimation to stereo, we created a BOP compatible stereo version of the YCB-V dataset. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation algorithms by utilizing stereo vision and can easily be adopted for other dense feature-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>4th I...</summary><p>4th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (ICPRAI)</p></details> |

In this context, RGB image and point-cloud observations are two commonly used modalities in visual-based robotic manipulation, but each of these modalities have their own limitations. Commercial point-cloud observations often suffer from issues like sparse sampling and noisy output due to the limits of the emission-reception imaging principle. On the other hand, RGB images, while rich in texture information, lack essential depth and 3D information crucial for robotic manipulation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an image-only robotic manipulation framework that leverages an eye-on-hand monocular camera installed on the robot's parallel gripper. By moving with the robot gripper, this camera gains the ability to actively perceive object from multiple perspectives during the manipulation process. This enables the estimation of 6D object poses, which can be utilized for manipulation. While, obtaining images from more and diverse viewpoints typically improves pose estimation, it also increases the manipulation time. To address this trade-off, we employ a reinforcement learning policy to synchronize the manipulation strategy with active perception, achieving a balance between 6D pose accuracy and manipulation efficiency. Our experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments showcase the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our approach. %, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve robust real-world robotic manipulation through active pose estimation. We believe that our method will inspire further research on real-world-oriented robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

To detect and grasp novel objects, zero-shot pose estimators determine poses without prior knowledge. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have shown considerable advances in robotics applications by establishing an understanding between language input and image input. In our work, we take advantage of VLMs zero-shot capabilities and translate this ability to 6D object pose estimation. We propose a novel framework for promptable zero-shot 6D object pose estimation using language embeddings. The idea is to derive a coarse location of an object based on the relevancy map of a language-embedded NeRF reconstruction and to compute the pose estimate with a point cloud registration method. Additionally, we provide an analysis of LERF's suitability for open-set object pose estimation. We examine hyperparameters, such as activation thresholds for relevancy maps and investigate the zero-shot capabilities on an instance- and category-level. Furthermore, we plan to conduct robotic grasping experiments in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Gaussian for Monocular 6D Pose Estimation from Sparse Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02581v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular object pose estimation, as a pivotal task in computer vision and robotics, heavily depends on accurate 2D-3D correspondences, which often demand costly CAD models that may not be readily available. Object 3D reconstruction methods offer an alternative, among which recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) afford a compelling potential. Yet its performance still suffers and tends to overfit with fewer input views. Embracing this challenge, we introduce SGPose, a novel framework for sparse view object pose estimation using Gaussian-based methods. Given as few as ten views, SGPose generates a geometric-aware representation by starting with a random cuboid initialization, eschewing reliance on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline-derived geometry as required by traditional 3DGS methods. SGPose removes the dependence on CAD models by regressing dense 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model from sparse input and random initialization, while the geometric-consistent depth supervision and online synthetic view warping are key to the success. Experiments on typical benchmarks, especially on the Occlusion LM-O dataset, demonstrate that SGPose outperforms existing methods even under sparse view constraints, under-scoring its potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

GS-Pose begins with a set of posed RGB images of a previously unseen object and builds three distinct representations stored in a database. At inference, GS-Pose operates sequentially by locating the object in the input image, estimating its initial 6D pose using a retrieval approach, and refining the pose with a render-and-compare method. The key insight is the application of the appropriate object representation at each stage of the process. In particular, for the refinement step, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique that offers high rendering speed and relatively low optimization time. Off-the-shelf toolchains and commodity hardware, such as mobile phones, can be used to capture new objects to be added to the database.

We initially detect instance-wise keypoints with a YOLOv8s model to compute 6D pose estimates of known objects by solving PnP. We use a ray tracing approach to track a geometric scene graph consisting of mesh models of object instances. In contrast to classical point-to-point matching, this leads to more robust results, especially under occlusions between objects instances. We show that using this hybrid strategy leads to robust self-localization, pre-segmentation of the range sensor data and accurate pose tracking of objects using the same environmental representation. All detected objects are integrated into a semantic scene graph. This scene graph then serves as a front end to a semantic mapping framework to allow spatial reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certifying Robustness of Learning-Based Keypoint Detection and Pose Estimation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00117v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the certification of the local robustness of vision-based two-stage 6D object pose estimation. The two-stage method for object pose estimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural network-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods' robustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on their local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust estimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform the certification of local robustness into neural network verification for classification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output specifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate verification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear operations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of injecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull representation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict semantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we propagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then formulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the setting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each pixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear, classification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both sound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on realistic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to certify the robustness of large-scale, keypoint-based pose estimation given images in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Unlike most existing real-world object-centric datasets which only come with RGB capturing, the direct capture of the depth channel allows better 3D annotations and broader downstream applications. WildRGB-D comprises large-scale category-level RGB-D object videos, which are taken using an iPhone to go around the objects in 360 degrees. It contains around 8500 recorded objects and nearly 20000 RGB-D videos across 46 common object categories.

The dataset is annotated with object masks, real-world scale camera poses, and reconstructed aggregated point clouds from RGBD videos. We benchmark four tasks with WildRGB-D including novel view synthesis, camera pose estimation, object 6d pose estimation, and object surface reconstruction.

The widely available, inexpensive and high-resolution RGB sensors and CNNs that allow for fast inference based on this modality make monocular approaches especially well suited for robotics applications. We observe that previous surveys on object pose estimation establish the state of the art for varying modalities, single- and multi-view settings, and datasets and metrics that consider a multitude of applications. We argue, however, that those works' broad scope hinders the identification of open challenges that are specific to monocular approaches and the derivation of promising future challenges for their application in robotics. By providing a unified view on recent publications from both robotics and computer vision, we find that occlusion handling, novel pose representations, and formalizing and improving category-level pose estimation are still fundamental challenges that are highly relevant for robotics. Moreover, to further improve robotic performance, large object sets, novel objects, refractive materials, and uncertainty estimates are central, largely unsolved open challenges. In order to address them, ontological reasoning, deformability handling, scene-level reasoning, realistic datasets, and the ecological footprint of algorithms need to be improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Transactions on Robotics: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609560 arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.11827</p></details> |

However, textureless and metallic objects still pose a significant challenge due to few visual cues and the texture bias of CNNs. To address his issue, we propose a strategy for inducing a shape bias to CNN training. In particular, by randomizing textures applied to object surfaces during data rendering, we create training data without consistent textural cues. This methodology allows for seamless integration into existing data rendering engines, and results in negligible computational overhead for data rendering and network training. Our findings demonstrate that the shape bias we induce via randomized texturing, improves over existing approaches using style transfer. We evaluate with three detectors and two pose estimators. For the most recent object detector and for pose estimation in general, estimation accuracy improves for textureless and metallic objects. Additionally we show that our approach increases the pose estimation accuracy in the presence of image noise and strong illumination changes.

| **[FoundPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with Foundation Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18809v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FoundPose, a model-based method for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single RGB image. The method can quickly onboard new objects using their 3D models without requiring any object- or task-specific training. In contrast, existing methods typically pre-train on large-scale, task-specific datasets in order to generalize to new objects and to bridge the image-to-model domain gap. We demonstrate that such generalization capabilities can be observed in a recent vision foundation model trained in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, our method estimates the object pose from image-to-model 2D-3D correspondences, which are established by matching patch descriptors from the recent DINOv2 model between the image and pre-rendered object templates. We find that reliable correspondences can be established by kNN matching of patch descriptors from an intermediate DINOv2 layer. Such descriptors carry stronger positional information than descriptors from the last layer, and we show their importance when semantic information is ambiguous due to object symmetries or a lack of texture. To avoid establishing correspondences against all object templates, we develop an efficient template retrieval approach that integrates the patch descriptors into the bag-of-words representation and can promptly propose a handful of similarly looking templates. Additionally, we apply featuremetric alignment to compensate for discrepancies in the 2D-3D correspondences caused by coarse patch sampling. The resulting method noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for refinement-free pose estimation on the standard BOP benchmark with seven diverse datasets and can be seamlessly combined with an existing render-and-compare refinement method to achieve RGB-only state-of-the-art results.

Both factors limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a pipeline that does not require CAD models and allows training a state-of-the-art pose estimator requiring only a small set of real images as input. Our method is based on a NeuS2 object representation, that we learn through a semi-automated procedure based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and object-agnostic segmentation. We exploit the novel-view synthesis ability of NeuS2 and simple cut-and-paste augmentation to automatically generate photorealistic object renderings, which we use to train the correspondence-based SurfEmb pose estimator. We evaluate our method on the LINEMOD-Occlusion dataset, extensively studying the impact of its individual components and showing competitive performance with respect to approaches based on CAD models and PBR data. We additionally demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of our pipeline on self-collected real-world objects, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art CAD-model-free approaches, with better accuracy and robustness to mild occlusions.

Our approach combines keypoint-based method with learnable pose regression through `keypoint-graph', which is a graph representation of the keypoints. KGpose first estimates 3D keypoints for each object using an attentional multi-modal feature fusion of RGB and point cloud features. These keypoints are estimated from each point of point cloud and converted into a graph representation. The network directly regresses 6D pose parameters for each point through a sequence of keypoint-graph embedding and local graph embedding which are designed with graph convolutions, followed by rotation and translation heads. The final pose for each object is selected from the candidates of point-wise predictions. The method achieves competitive results on the benchmark dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. KGpose enables multi-object pose estimation without requiring an extra localization step, offering a unified and efficient solution for understanding geometric contexts in complex scenes for robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable using natural language descriptions to support 6D pose estimation of unseen objects, these solutions underperform compared to model-based methods. In this work we present Horyon, an open-vocabulary VLM-based architecture that addresses relative pose estimation between two scenes of an unseen object, described by a textual prompt only. We use the textual prompt to identify the unseen object in the scenes and then obtain high-resolution multi-scale features. These features are used to extract cross-scene matches for registration. We evaluate our model on a benchmark with a large variety of unseen objects across four datasets, namely REAL275, Toyota-Light, Linemod, and YCB-Video. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, outperforming by 12.6 in Average Recall the previous best-performing approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

| **[Open-vocabulary object 6D pose estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00690v4)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the new setting of open-vocabulary object 6D pose estimation, in which a textual prompt is used to specify the object of interest. In contrast to existing approaches, in our setting (i) the object of interest is specified solely through the textual prompt, (ii) no object model (e.g., CAD or video sequence) is required at inference, and (iii) the object is imaged from two RGBD viewpoints of different scenes. To operate in this setting, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model to segment the object of interest from the scenes and to estimate its relative 6D pose. The key of our approach is a carefully devised strategy to fuse object-level information provided by the prompt with local image features, resulting in a feature space that can generalize to novel concepts. We validate our approach on a new benchmark based on two popular datasets, REAL275 and Toyota-Light, which collectively encompass 34 object instances appearing in four thousand image pairs. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both a well-established hand-crafted method and a recent deep learning-based baseline in estimating the relative 6D pose of objects in different scenes.

We train a Diffusion Model to bridge this gap using a relatively small dataset of real-world images randomly collected from unlabeled everyday objects via the DIGIT sensor. Subsequently, we employ a simulator to generate images by uniformly sampling the surface of objects from the YCB Model Set. These simulated images are then translated into the real domain using the Diffusion Model and automatically labeled to train a classifier. During this training, we further align features of the two domains using an adversarial procedure. Our evaluation is conducted on a dataset of tactile images obtained from a set of ten 3D printed YCB objects. The results reveal a total accuracy of 81.9%, a significant improvement compared to the 34.7% achieved by the classifier trained solely on simulated images. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. We further validate our approach using the classifier on a 6D object pose estimation task from tactile data.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, accepted to ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Learning based approaches typically require training data from a highly accurate CAD model or labeled training data acquired using a complex setup. We address this by learning to estimate pose from weakly labeled data without a known CAD model. We propose to use a NeRF to learn object shape implicitly which is later used to learn view-invariant features in conjunction with CNN using a contrastive loss. While NeRF helps in learning features that are view-consistent, CNN ensures that the learned features respect symmetry. During inference, CNN is used to predict view-invariant features which can be used to establish correspondences with the implicit 3d model in NeRF. The correspondences are then used to estimate the pose in the reference frame of NeRF. Our approach can also handle symmetric objects unlike other approaches using a similar training setup. Specifically, we learn viewpoint invariant, discriminative features using NeRF which are later used for pose estimation. We evaluated our approach on LM, LM-Occlusion, and T-Less dataset and achieved benchmark accuracy despite using weakly labeled data.</p></details> | 3DV 2024 |

This scarcity impedes comprehensive evaluation of model performance, limiting research advancements. Furthermore, the restricted number of available instances or categories curtails its applications. To address these issues, this paper introduces Omni6DPose, a substantial dataset characterized by its diversity in object categories, large scale, and variety in object materials. Omni6DPose is divided into three main components: ROPE (Real 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), which includes 332K images annotated with over 1.5M annotations across 581 instances in 149 categories; SOPE(Simulated 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), consisting of 475K images created in a mixed reality setting with depth simulation, annotated with over 5M annotations across 4162 instances in the same 149 categories; and the manually aligned real scanned objects used in both ROPE and SOPE. Omni6DPose is inherently challenging due to the substantial variations and ambiguities. To address this challenge, we introduce GenPose++, an enhanced version of the SOTA category-level pose estimation framework, incorporating two pivotal improvements: Semantic-aware feature extraction and Clustering-based aggregation. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive benchmarking analysis to evaluate the performance of previous methods on this large-scale dataset in the realms of 6D object pose estimation and pose tracking.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed Sparse Color-Code Net (SCCN) embodies a clear and concise pipeline design to effectively address this requirement. SCCN performs pixel-level predictions on the target object in the RGB image, utilizing the sparsity of essential object geometry features to speed up the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) computation process. Additionally, it introduces a novel pixel-level geometry-based object symmetry representation that seamlessly integrates with the initial pose predictions, effectively addressing symmetric object ambiguities.

Given challenges like rust, high reflectivity, and absent textures, this paper introduces a point cloud based pose estimation framework (PS6D). PS6D centers on slender and multi-symmetric objects. It extracts multi-scale features through an attention-guided feature extraction module, designs a symmetry-aware rotation loss and a center distance sensitive translation loss to regress the pose of each point to the centroid of the instance, and then uses a two-stage clustering method to complete instance segmentation and pose estimation. Objects from the Sil\'eane and IPA datasets and typical workpieces from industrial practice are used to generate data and evaluate the algorithm. In comparison to the state-of-the-art approach, PS6D demonstrates an 11.5\% improvement in F$_{1_{inst}}$ and a 14.8\% improvement in Recall. The main part of PS6D has been deployed to the software of Mech-Mind, and achieves a 91.7\% success rate in bin-picking experiments, marking its application in industrial pose estimation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Domain randomization hereby plays an important role in reducing the simulation to reality gap. However, this generalization might not be effective in specialized domains like a production environment involving complex assemblies. Either the individual parts, trained with synthetic images, are integrated in much larger assemblies making them indistinguishable from their counterparts and result in false positives or are partially occluded just enough to give rise to false negatives. Domain knowledge is vital in these cases and if conceived effectively while generating synthetic data, can show a considerable improvement in bridging the simulation to reality gap. This paper focuses on synthetic data generation procedures for parts and assemblies used in a production environment. The basic procedures for synthetic data generation and their various combinations are evaluated and compared on images captured in a production environment, where results show up to 15% improvement using combinations of basic procedures. Reducing the simulation to reality gap in this way can aid to utilize the true potential of robot assisted production using artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, LaTeX; typos corrected; has not been presented in any conference or published in journal</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose MatchU, a Fuse-Describe-Match strategy for 6D pose estimation from RGB-D images. MatchU is a generic approach that fuses 2D texture and 3D geometric cues for 6D pose prediction of unseen objects. We rely on learning geometric 3D descriptors that are rotation-invariant by design. By encoding pose-agnostic geometry, the learned descriptors naturally generalize to unseen objects and capture symmetries. To tackle ambiguous associations using 3D geometry only, we fuse additional RGB information into our descriptor. This is achieved through a novel attention-based mechanism that fuses cross-modal information, together with a matching loss that leverages the latent space learned from RGB data to guide the descriptor learning process. Extensive experiments reveal the generalizability of both the RGB-D fusion strategy as well as the descriptor efficacy. Benefiting from the novel designs, MatchU surpasses all existing methods by a significant margin in terms of both accuracy and speed, even without the requirement of expensive re-training or rendering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Quantification with Deep Ensembles for 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07741v2)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The estimation of 6D object poses is a fundamental task in many computer vision applications. Particularly, in high risk scenarios such as human-robot interaction, industrial inspection, and automation, reliable pose estimates are crucial. In the last years, increasingly accurate and robust deep-learning-based approaches for 6D object pose estimation have been proposed. Many top-performing methods are not end-to-end trainable but consist of multiple stages. In the context of deep uncertainty quantification, deep ensembles are considered as state of the art since they have been proven to produce well-calibrated and robust uncertainty estimates. However, deep ensembles can only be applied to methods that can be trained end-to-end. In this work, we propose a method to quantify the uncertainty of multi-stage 6D object pose estimation approaches with deep ensembles. For the implementation, we choose SurfEmb as representative, since it is one of the top-performing 6D object pose estimation approaches in the BOP Challenge 2022. We apply established metrics and concepts for deep uncertainty quantification to evaluate the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel uncertainty calibration score for regression tasks to quantify the quality of the estimated uncertainty.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Due to the lack of depth information, existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to occlusion and illumination changes. How to extract and utilize the geometry features in depth information is crucial to achieve accurate predictions. To this end, we propose TransPose, a novel 6D pose framework that exploits Transformer Encoder with geometry-aware module to develop better learning of point cloud feature representations. Specifically, we first uniformly sample point cloud and extract local geometry features with the designed local feature extractor base on graph convolution network. To improve robustness to occlusion, we adopt Transformer to perform the exchange of global information, making each local feature contains global information. Finally, we introduce geometry-aware module in Transformer Encoder, which to form an effective constrain for point cloud feature learning and makes the global information exchange more tightly coupled with point cloud tasks. Extensive experiments indicate the effectiveness of TransPose, our pose estimation pipeline achieves competitive results on three benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NEUROCOMPUTING</p></details> |

Besides the three tasks from 2022 (model-based 2D detection, 2D segmentation, and 6D localization of objects seen during training), the 2023 challenge introduced new variants of these tasks focused on objects unseen during training. In the new tasks, methods were required to learn new objects during a short onboarding stage (max 5 minutes, 1 GPU) from provided 3D object models. The best 2023 method for 6D localization of unseen objects (GenFlow) notably reached the accuracy of the best 2020 method for seen objects (CosyPose), although being noticeably slower.

In response, we introduce a novel score-based diffusion method applied to the $SE(3)$ group, marking the first application of diffusion models to $SE(3)$ within the image domain, specifically tailored for pose estimation tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the method's efficacy in handling pose ambiguity, mitigating perspective-induced ambiguity, and showcasing the robustness of our surrogate Stein score formulation on $SE(3)$. This formulation not only improves the convergence of denoising process but also enhances computational efficiency.

In this area, dense correspondence-based methods have achieved leading performance. However, they do not explicitly consider the local and global geometric information of different instances, resulting in poor generalization ability to unseen instances with significant shape variations. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel Instance-Adaptive and Geometric-Aware Keypoint Learning method for category-level 6D object pose estimation (AG-Pose), which includes two key designs: (1) The first design is an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Detection module, which can adaptively detect a set of sparse keypoints for various instances to represent their geometric structures. (2) The second design is a Geometric-Aware Feature Aggregation module, which can efficiently integrate the local and global geometric information into keypoint features. These two modules can work together to establish robust keypoint-level correspondences for unseen instances, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the model.Experimental results on CAMERA25 and REAL275 datasets show that the proposed AG-Pose outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin without category-specific shape priors.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

Our approach can be instantly applied at test-time to a novel object without fine-tuning, as long as its CAD model is given, or a small number of reference images are captured. We bridge the gap between these two setups with a neural implicit representation that allows for effective novel view synthesis, keeping the downstream pose estimation modules invariant under the same unified framework. Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation. Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin. In addition, it even achieves comparable results to instance-level methods despite the reduced assumptions. Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/</p></details> |  |

Inspired by their denoising capability, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework (6D-Diff) to handle the noise and indeterminacy in object pose estimation for better performance. In our framework, to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondence, we formulate 2D keypoints detection as a reverse diffusion (denoising) process. To facilitate such a denoising process, we design a Mixture-of-Cauchy-based forward diffusion process and condition the reverse process on the object features.

Specifically, previous methods for novel objects do not make good use of the target object's 3D shape information since they focus on generalization by processing the shape indirectly, making them less effective. We present GenFlow, an approach that enables both accuracy and generalization to novel objects with the guidance of the target object's shape. Our method predicts optical flow between the rendered image and the observed image and refines the 6D pose iteratively. It boosts the performance by a constraint of the 3D shape and the generalizable geometric knowledge learned from an end-to-end differentiable system. We further improve our model by designing a cascade network architecture to exploit the multi-scale correlations and coarse-to-fine refinement. GenFlow ranked first on the unseen object pose estimation benchmarks in both the RGB and RGB-D cases. It also achieves performance competitive with existing state-of-the-art methods for the seen object pose estimation without any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Uncertain pose estimates can lead to task failures; however, a certain degree of error in the pose estimates is often acceptable. Hence, by quantifying errors in the object pose estimate and acceptable errors for task success, robots can make informed decisions. This is a challenging problem as both the object pose uncertainty and acceptable error for the robotic task are often multi-modal and cannot be parameterized with commonly used uni-modal distributions. In this paper, we introduce a framework for evaluating robotic task success under object pose uncertainty, representing both the estimated error space of the object pose and the acceptable error space for task success using multi-modal non-parametric probability distributions. The proposed framework pre-computes the acceptable error space for task success using dynamic simulations and subsequently integrates the pre-computed acceptable error space over the estimated error space of the object pose to predict the likelihood of the task success. We evaluated the proposed framework on two mobile manipulation tasks. Our results show that by representing the estimated and the acceptable error space using multi-modal non-parametric distributions, we achieve higher task success rates and fewer failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

GigaPose first leverages discriminative "templates", rendered images of the CAD models, to recover the out-of-plane rotation and then uses patch correspondences to estimate the four remaining parameters. Our approach samples templates in only a two-degrees-of-freedom space instead of the usual three and matches the input image to the templates using fast nearest-neighbor search in feature space, results in a speedup factor of 35x compared to the state of the art. Moreover, GigaPose is significantly more robust to segmentation errors. Our extensive evaluation on the seven core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated with existing refinement methods. Additionally, we show the potential of GigaPose with 3D models predicted by recent work on 3D reconstruction from a single image, relaxing the need for CAD models and making 6D pose object estimation much more convenient.

Despite the impressive progress enabled by deep learning, single-view RGB pose estimation models perform poorly in cluttered dynamic environments. Imbuing the rich temporal information contained in the video of scenes has the potential to enhance models ability to deal with the adverse effects of occlusion and the dynamic nature of the environments. Moreover, joint object detection and pose estimation models are better suited to leverage the co-dependent nature of the tasks for improving the accuracy of both tasks. To this end, we propose attention-based temporal fusion for multi-object 6D pose estimation that accumulates information across multiple frames of a video sequence. Our MOTPose method takes a sequence of images as input and performs joint object detection and pose estimation for all objects in one forward pass. It learns to aggregate both object embeddings and object parameters over multiple time steps using cross-attention-based fusion modules. We evaluate our method on the physically-realistic cluttered bin-picking dataset SynPick and the YCB-Video dataset and demonstrate improved pose estimation accuracy as well as better object detection accuracy</p></details> |  |

Fortunately, the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has showcased remarkable zero-shot transfer performance, which provides a promising solution to tackle this task. Motivated by this, we introduce SAM-6D, a novel framework designed to realize the task through two steps, including instance segmentation and pose estimation. Given the target objects, SAM-6D employs two dedicated sub-networks, namely Instance Segmentation Model (ISM) and Pose Estimation Model (PEM), to perform these steps on cluttered RGB-D images. ISM takes SAM as an advanced starting point to generate all possible object proposals and selectively preserves valid ones through meticulously crafted object matching scores in terms of semantics, appearance and geometry. By treating pose estimation as a partial-to-partial point matching problem, PEM performs a two-stage point matching process featuring a novel design of background tokens to construct dense 3D-3D correspondence, ultimately yielding the pose estimates. Without bells and whistles, SAM-6D outperforms the existing methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark for both instance segmentation and pose estimation of novel objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2024.

| **[Improving 2D-3D Dense Correspondences with Diffusion Models for 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06436v1)** | 2024-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating 2D-3D correspondences between RGB images and 3D space is a fundamental problem in 6D object pose estimation. Recent pose estimators use dense correspondence maps and Point-to-Point algorithms to estimate object poses. The accuracy of pose estimation depends heavily on the quality of the dense correspondence maps and their ability to withstand occlusion, clutter, and challenging material properties. Currently, dense correspondence maps are estimated using image-to-image translation models based on GANs, Autoencoders, or direct regression models. However, recent advancements in image-to-image translation have led to diffusion models being the superior choice when evaluated on benchmarking datasets. In this study, we compare image-to-image translation networks based on GANs and diffusion models for the downstream task of 6D object pose estimation. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion-based image-to-image translation model outperforms the GAN, revealing potential for further improvements in 6D object pose estimation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the First Austrian Symposium on AI, Robotics, and Vision 2024</p></details> |
| **[LocPoseNet: Robust Location Prior for Unseen Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16290v3)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object location prior is critical for the standard 6D object pose estimation setting. The prior can be used to initialize the 3D object translation and facilitate 3D object rotation estimation. Unfortunately, the object detectors that are used for this purpose do not generalize to unseen objects. Therefore, existing 6D pose estimation methods for unseen objects either assume the ground-truth object location to be known or yield inaccurate results when it is unavailable. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a method, LocPoseNet, able to robustly learn location prior for unseen objects. Our method builds upon a template matching strategy, where we propose to distribute the reference kernels and convolve them with a query to efficiently compute multi-scale correlations. We then introduce a novel translation estimator, which decouples scale-aware and scale-robust features to predict different object location parameters. Our method outperforms existing works by a large margin on LINEMOD and GenMOP. We further construct a challenging synthetic dataset, which allows us to highlight the better robustness of our method to various noise sources.

| **[Leveraging Positional Encoding for Robust Multi-Reference-Based Object 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16284v1)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating the pose of an object is a crucial task in computer vision and robotics. There are two main deep learning approaches for this: geometric representation regression and iterative refinement. However, these methods have some limitations that reduce their effectiveness. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and propose new strategies to overcome them. To tackle the issue of blurry geometric representation, we use positional encoding with high-frequency components for the object's 3D coordinates. To address the local minimum problem in refinement methods, we introduce a normalized image plane-based multi-reference refinement strategy that's independent of intrinsic matrix constraints. Lastly, we utilize adaptive instance normalization and a simple occlusion augmentation method to help our model concentrate on the target object. Our experiments on Linemod, Linemod-Occlusion, and YCB-Video datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods. We will soon release the code.</p></details> |  |

To evaluate the robustness of SNEs on noisy data, we create a large-scale synthetic surface normal (SSN) dataset containing 20 scenarios (ten indoor scenarios and ten outdoor scenarios with and without random Gaussian noise added to depth images). Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3F2N+ achieves greater performance than all other geometry-based surface normal estimators, with average angular errors of 7.85$^\circ$, 8.95$^\circ$, 9.25$^\circ$, and 11.98$^\circ$ on the clean-indoor, clean-outdoor, noisy-indoor, and noisy-outdoor datasets, respectively. We conduct three additional experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating our proposed 3F2N+ into downstream robot perception tasks, including freespace detection, 6D object pose estimation, and point cloud completion.

Building on successful instance-level approaches, research is shifting towards category-level pose estimation for practical applications. Current category-level datasets, however, fall short in annotation quality and pose variety. Addressing this, we introduce HouseCat6D, a new category-level 6D pose dataset. It features 1) multi-modality with Polarimetric RGB and Depth (RGBD+P), 2) encompasses 194 diverse objects across 10 household categories, including two photometrically challenging ones, and 3) provides high-quality pose annotations with an error range of only 1.35 mm to 1.74 mm. The dataset also includes 4) 41 large-scale scenes with comprehensive viewpoint and occlusion coverage, 5) a checkerboard-free environment, and 6) dense 6D parallel-jaw robotic grasp annotations. Additionally, we present benchmark results for leading category-level pose estimation networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visually Guided Model Predictive Robot Control via 6D Object Pose Localization and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05344v1)** | 2023-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of this work is to enable manipulation tasks with respect to the 6D pose of a dynamically moving object using a camera mounted on a robot. Examples include maintaining a constant relative 6D pose of the robot arm with respect to the object, grasping the dynamically moving object, or co-manipulating the object together with a human. Fast and accurate 6D pose estimation is crucial to achieve smooth and stable robot control in such situations. The contributions of this work are three fold. First, we propose a new visual perception module that asynchronously combines accurate learning-based 6D object pose localizer and a high-rate model-based 6D pose tracker. The outcome is a low-latency accurate and temporally consistent 6D object pose estimation from the input video stream at up to 120 Hz. Second, we develop a visually guided robot arm controller that combines the new visual perception module with a torque-based model predictive control algorithm. Asynchronous combination of the visual and robot proprioception signals at their corresponding frequencies results in stable and robust 6D object pose guided robot arm control. Third, we experimentally validate the proposed approach on a challenging 6D pose estimation benchmark and demonstrate 6D object pose-guided control with dynamically moving objects on a real 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE(3) Diffusion Model-based Point Cloud Registration for Robust 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17359v1)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce an SE(3) diffusion model-based point cloud registration framework for 6D object pose estimation in real-world scenarios. Our approach formulates the 3D registration task as a denoising diffusion process, which progressively refines the pose of the source point cloud to obtain a precise alignment with the model point cloud. Training our framework involves two operations: An SE(3) diffusion process and an SE(3) reverse process. The SE(3) diffusion process gradually perturbs the optimal rigid transformation of a pair of point clouds by continuously injecting noise (perturbation transformation). By contrast, the SE(3) reverse process focuses on learning a denoising network that refines the noisy transformation step-by-step, bringing it closer to the optimal transformation for accurate pose estimation. Unlike standard diffusion models used in linear Euclidean spaces, our diffusion model operates on the SE(3) manifold. This requires exploiting the linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{se}(3)$ associated with SE(3) to constrain the transformation transitions during the diffusion and reverse processes. Additionally, to effectively train our denoising network, we derive a registration-specific variational lower bound as the optimization objective for model learning. Furthermore, we show that our denoising network can be constructed with a surrogate registration model, making our approach applicable to different deep registration networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our diffusion registration framework presents outstanding pose estimation performance on the real-world TUD-L, LINEMOD, and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS-2023</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Based Object 6D-Pose Estimation during Non-Prehensile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13572v3)** | 2023-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method to track the 6D pose of an object over time, while the object is under non-prehensile manipulation by a robot. At any given time during the manipulation of the object, we assume access to the robot joint controls and an image from a camera. We use the robot joint controls to perform a physics-based prediction of how the object might be moving. We then combine this prediction with the observation coming from the camera, to estimate the object pose as accurately as possible. We use a particle filtering approach to combine the control information with the visual information. We compare the proposed method with two baselines: (i) using only an image-based pose estimation system at each time-step, and (ii) a particle filter which does not perform the computationally expensive physics predictions, but assumes the object moves with constant velocity. Our results show that making physics-based predictions is worth the computational cost, resulting in more accurate tracking, and estimating object pose even when the object is not clearly visible to the camera.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to learn 6D poses for roboticassembly by natural language instructions. For this purpose, Language-Instructed 6D Pose Regression Network (LanPose) is proposed to jointly predict the 6D poses of the observed object and the corresponding assembly position. Our proposed approach is based on the fusion of geometric and linguistic features, which allows us to finely integrate multi-modality input and map it to the 6D pose in SE(3) space by the cross-attention mechanism and the language-integrated 6D pose mapping module, respectively. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, an integrated robotic system is established to precisely and robustly perceive, grasp, manipulate and assemble blocks by language commands. 98.09 and 93.55 in ADD(-S)-0.1d are derived for the prediction of 6D object pose and 6D assembly pose, respectively. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed language-instructed 6D pose estimation methodology and its potential to enable robots to better understand and execute natural language instructions.</p></details> | 8 pages |

| **[HyperDiff: Hypergraph Guided Diffusion Model for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14431v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process. Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty, alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learnable SMPLify: A Neural Solution for Optimization-Free Human Pose Inverse Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13562v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space. Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify, generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/Learnable-SMPLify.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refinement Module based on Parse Graph for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11069v7)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parse graphs have been widely used in human pose estimation (HPE) to model the hierarchical structure and context relations of the human body, which has been shown to effectively improve robustness and accuracy. But most methods rely on parse graphs built from predefined skeletons, causing two key issues: poor integratability with other models, and complex designs with redundant parameters for hierarchy and context relation modeling of body. To address these issues, we propose a novel Refinement Module based on Parse Graph (RMPG). RMPG abandons skeleton connections and refines features by building implicit hierarchical structures and context relations between sub-feature maps, with strong integratability. Furthermore, our hierarchical network design demonstrates that RMPG can model the body's hierarchical structure and context relations with a simpler architecture and fewer parameters. RMPG operates in two stages: the top-down decomposition recursively partitions the feature map into a tree-structured hierarchy, where each node corresponds to a sub-feature map; the bottom-up composition aggregates context information to progressively refine the feature representation. Extensive experiments show that RMPG can be flexibly embedded into various methods, including our hierarchical networks, and consistently improves performance across multiple mainstream HPE benchmarks. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable Diffusion-Based Approach for Human De-Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12663v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can infer the missing parts of an occluded object by leveraging prior knowledge and visible cues. However, enabling deep learning models to accurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task. De-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions. The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as 2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | MM 2025 |

To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly improves generalization performance without requiring additional data collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models (e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures. Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$, while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under review</p></details> |
| **[A Coarse-to-Fine Human Pose Estimation Method based on Two-stage Distillation and Progressive Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11212v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation. However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model. The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is more significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient High-Resolution Visual Representation Learning with State Space Model for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03174v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing long-range dependencies while preserving high-resolution visual representations is crucial for dense prediction tasks such as human pose estimation. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced global modeling through self-attention but suffer from quadratic computational complexity with respect to token count, limiting their efficiency and scalability to high-resolution inputs, especially on mobile and resource-constrained devices. State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, offer an efficient alternative by combining global receptive fields with linear computational complexity, enabling scalable and resource-friendly sequence modeling. However, when applied to dense prediction tasks, existing visual SSMs face key limitations: weak spatial inductive bias, long-range forgetting from hidden state decay, and low-resolution outputs that hinder fine-grained localization. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Visual State Space (DVSS) block, which augments visual state space models with multi-scale convolutional operations to enhance local spatial representations and strengthen spatial inductive biases. Through architectural exploration and theoretical analysis, we incorporate deformable operation into the DVSS block, identifying it as an efficient and effective mechanism to enhance semantic aggregation and mitigate long-range forgetting via input-dependent, adaptive spatial sampling. We embed DVSS into a multi-branch high-resolution architecture to build HRVMamba, a novel model for efficient high-resolution representation learning. Extensive experiments on human pose estimation, image classification, and semantic segmentation show that HRVMamba performs competitively against leading CNN-, ViT-, and SSM-based baselines.

Mamba, a recent sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$ fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and 2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area, 9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ESWEEK 2025 (CODES+ISSS) conference</p></details> |

However, mmWave radar relies on the collection of reflected signals from the target, and the radar signals containing information is difficult to be fully applied. This has been a long-standing hindrance to the improvement of pose estimation accuracy. To address this major challenge, this paper introduces a probability map guided multi-format feature fusion model, ProbRadarM3F. This is a novel radar feature extraction framework using a traditional FFT method in parallel with a probability map based positional encoding method. ProbRadarM3F fuses the traditional heatmap features and the positional features, then effectively achieves the estimation of 14 keypoints of the human body. Experimental evaluation on the HuPR dataset proves the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper, outperforming other methods experimented on this dataset with an AP of 69.9 %. The emphasis of our study is focusing on the position information that is not exploited before in radar singal. This provides direction to investigate other potential non-redundant information from mmWave rader.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present Garment Inertial Poser (GaIP), a method for estimating full-body poses from sparse and loosely attached IMU sensors. We first simulate IMU recordings using an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. Our transformer-based diffusion models synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses from this challenging loose IMU data. We also demonstrate that incorporating garment-related parameters during training on loose IMU data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Our experiments show that our diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperform state-of-the-art inertial full-body pose estimators, both quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research on motion capture from such realistic sensor placements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents MultiFormer, a wireless sensing system that accurately estimates human pose through CSI. The proposed system adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor with multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model inter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The extracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on on the public MM-Fi dataset and our self-collected dataset show that the MultiFormer achieves higher accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, especially for high-mobility keypoints (wrists, elbows) that are particularly difficult for previous methods to accurately estimate.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffPose-Animal: A Language-Conditioned Diffusion Framework for Animal Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08783v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.</p></details> | 13pages,2figures |
| **[StarPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial-Temporal Autoregressive Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02056v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

| **[VOccl3D: A Video Benchmark Dataset for 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation under real Occlusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06757v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied, with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g., most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques, incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions, offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets.

We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26 three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals, with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021. As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification, resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.</p></details> |  |

We develop the complete pipeline for a single vision sensor based multi-pedestrian detection and tracking, pose estimation, and monocular depth perception. Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance, even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements, including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7% improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware and inclusive robot behaviour.</p></details> |  |
| **[BaroPoser: Real-time Human Motion Tracking from IMUs and Barometers in Everyday Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03313v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |

Additionally, innovative breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1) Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2) Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation technology.</p></details> | 10 pages, 20 figures |
| **[IMUCoCo: Enabling Flexible On-Body IMU Placement for Human Pose Estimation and Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01894v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IMUs are regularly used to sense human motion, recognize activities, and estimate full-body pose. Users are typically required to place sensors in predefined locations that are often dictated by common wearable form factors and the machine learning model's training process. Consequently, despite the increasing number of everyday devices equipped with IMUs, the limited adaptability has seriously constrained the user experience to only using a few well-explored device placements (e.g., wrist and ears). In this paper, we rethink IMU-based motion sensing by acknowledging that signals can be captured from any point on the human body. We introduce IMU over Continuous Coordinates (IMUCoCo), a novel framework that maps signals from a variable number of IMUs placed on the body surface into a unified feature space based on their spatial coordinates. These features can be plugged into downstream models for pose estimation and activity recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that IMUCoCo supports accurate pose estimation in a wide range of typical and atypical sensor placements. Overall, IMUCoCo supports significantly more flexible use of IMUs for motion sensing than the state-of-the-art, allowing users to place their sensors-laden devices according to their needs and preferences. The framework also supports the ability to change device locations depending on the context and suggests placement depending on the use case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection, Pose Estimation and Segmentation for Multiple Bodies: Closing the Virtuous Circle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01562v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation methods work well on isolated people but struggle with multiple-bodies-in-proximity scenarios. Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models.

| **[Mitigating Resolution-Drift in Federated Learning: Case of Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23461v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks. However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs (teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks that rely on preserving spatial detail.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Sharp to Blur: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for 2D Human Pose Estimation Under Extreme Motion Blur Using Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22438v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation, sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation, we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations. Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain adaptation in real-world motion blur environments. Our project codes are available at https://github.com/kmax2001/EvSharp2Blur.</p></details> |  |
| **[KASportsFormer: Kinematic Anatomy Enhanced Transformer for 3D Human Pose Estimation on Short Sports Scene Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20763v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts. Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser (LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/jw0r1n/KASportsFormer</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Testing-Time Optimization for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02339v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although data-driven methods have achieved success in 3D human pose estimation, they often suffer from domain gaps and exhibit limited generalization. In contrast, optimization-based methods excel in fine-tuning for specific cases but are generally inferior to data-driven methods in overall performance. We observe that previous optimization-based methods commonly rely on a projection constraint, which only ensures alignment in 2D space, potentially leading to the overfitting problem. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware testing-time Optimization (UAO) framework, which keeps the prior information of the pre-trained model and alleviates the overfitting problem using the uncertainty of joints. Specifically, during the training phase, we design an effective 2D-to-3D network for estimating the corresponding 3D pose while quantifying the uncertainty of each 3D joint. For optimization during testing, the proposed optimization framework freezes the pre-trained model and optimizes only a latent state. Projection loss is then employed to ensure the generated poses are well aligned in 2D space for high-quality optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the uncertainty of each joint to determine how much each joint is allowed for optimization. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework are validated through extensive experiments on challenging datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. Notably, our approach outperforms the previous best result by a large margin of 5.5\% on Human3.6M.

| **[A Structure-aware and Motion-adaptive Framework for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19852v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically, SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

Since calibrating multiple cameras and finding matches across their views are inherently interdependent, performing both in a unified framework poses a significant challenge. We address these issues as a single registration problem of matching two sets of 3D points, leveraging human motion in dynamic multi-person scenes. To this end, we utilize 3D human poses obtained from an off-the-shelf monocular 3D human pose estimator and transform them into 3D points on a unit sphere, to solve the rotation, time offset, and the association alternatingly. We employ a probabilistic approach that can jointly solve both problems of aligning spatiotemporal data and establishing correspondences through soft assignment between two views. The translation is determined by applying coplanarity constraints. The pairwise registration results are integrated into a multiview setup, and then a nonlinear optimization method is used to improve the accuracy of the camera poses, temporal offsets, and multi-person associations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method as a practical marker-free calibration tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Physics-based Human Pose Estimation from a Single Moving RGB Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17406v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods, while achieving state-of-the-art results, suffer from artifacts when the scene does not have a strictly flat ground plane or when the camera is moving. Moreover, these methods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without ground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry changes. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first non-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a dynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion with human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a physics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints for more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat scenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to obtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera trajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then refine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer. From our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle with this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar environments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses in world coordinates.</p></details> |  |

This ''data gap'' is a key challenge both for building intelligent artificial systems and for understanding human development. Egocentric video capturing children's experience--their ''training data''--is a key ingredient for comparison of humans and models and for the development of algorithmic innovations to bridge this gap. Yet there are few such datasets available, and extant data are low-resolution, have limited metadata, and importantly, represent only a small set of children's experiences. Here, we provide the first release of a large developmental egocentric video dataset--the BabyView dataset--recorded using a high-resolution camera with a large vertical field-of-view and gyroscope/accelerometer data. This 868 hour dataset includes egocentric videos from children spanning 6 months to 3 years of age in longitudinal, at-home contexts. We provide gold-standard annotations for the evaluation of speech transcription, speaker diarization, and human pose estimation, and evaluate models in each of these domains. We train self-supervised language and vision models and evaluate their transfer to out-of-distribution tasks, including syntactic structure learning, object recognition, depth estimation, and image segmentation. Although performance in each domain scales with dataset size, overall performance is relatively lower than when models are trained on curated datasets, especially in the visual domain. Our dataset stands as an open challenge for robust, human-like AI systems: how can such systems achieve human-levels of success on the same scale and distribution of training data as humans?</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables and Appendix.

While the airports are more likely to become hotspots for potential conflicts to break out which can cause serious delays to flights and several safety issues. An intelligent algorithm which renders security surveillance more effective in detecting conflicts would bring many benefits to the passengers in terms of their safety, finance, and travelling efficiency. This paper details the development of a machine learning model to classify conflicting behaviour in a crowd. HRNet is used to segment the images and then two approaches are taken to classify the poses of people in the frame via multiple classifiers. Among them, it was found that the support vector machine (SVM) achieved the most performant achieving precision of 94.37%. Where the model falls short is against ambiguous behaviour such as a hug or losing track of a subject in the frame. The resulting model has potential for deployment within an airport if improvements are made to cope with the vast number of potential passengers in view as well as training against further ambiguous behaviours which will arise in an airport setting. In turn, will provide the capability to enhance security surveillance and improve airport safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>One o...</summary><p>One of the authors has expressed privacy concerns and made a related request</p></details> |

Its place in art reflects its growing applications in industry, such as robotics. However, those interactions often remains too technical and machine-driven for people to really engage into. On the artistic side, new technologies are often not explored in their full potential and lag a bit behind, so that state-of-the-art research does not make its way up to museums and exhibitions. Machines should support people's imagination and poetry in a seamless interface to their body or soul.

We design a neuromorphic multihead human pose estimation neural sensor that shapes sound scapes and visual output with fine body movement control. In particular, the feature extractor is a spiking neural network tailored for a dedicated neuromorphic chip.

While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE ICRA 2025 (workshop: Enhancing Human Mobility: From Computer Vision-Based Motion Tracking to Wearable Assistive Robot Control), May 2025, Atlanta (Georgia), United States</p></details> |

This scenario poses a challenge in extracting and leveraging multi-scale features, which is often essential for precise inference. To address this challenge, we propose a new attention mechanism, named cascaded multi-scale attention (CMSA), tailored for use in CNN-ViT hybrid architectures, to handle low-resolution inputs effectively. The design of CMSA enables the extraction and seamless integration of features across various scales without necessitating the downsampling of the input image or feature maps. This is achieved through a novel combination of grouped multi-head self-attention mechanisms with window-based local attention and cascaded fusion of multi-scale features over different scales. This architecture allows for the effective handling of features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to perform tasks such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more with low-resolution images. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in these areas with fewer parameters, showcasing its potential for broad application in real-world scenarios where capturing high-resolution images is not feasible.

Traditional methods for calisthenics skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods, achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, In International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing</p></details> |

While HAR has been extensively studied, action summarization using Wi-Fi and IMU signals in smart-home environments , which involves identifying and summarizing continuous actions, remains an emerging task. This paper introduces the novel XRF V2 dataset, designed for indoor daily activity Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and action summarization. XRF V2 integrates multimodal data from Wi-Fi signals, IMU sensors (smartphones, smartwatches, headphones, and smart glasses), and synchronized video recordings, offering a diverse collection of indoor activities from 16 volunteers across three distinct environments. To tackle TAL and action summarization, we propose the XRFMamba neural network, which excels at capturing long-term dependencies in untrimmed sensory sequences and achieves the best performance with an average mAP of 78.74, outperforming the recent WiFiTAD by 5.49 points in mAP@avg while using 35% fewer parameters. In action summarization, we introduce a new metric, Response Meaning Consistency (RMC), to evaluate action summarization performance. And it achieves an average Response Meaning Consistency (mRMC) of 0.802. We envision XRF V2 as a valuable resource for advancing research in human action localization, action forecasting, pose estimation, multimodal foundation models pre-training, synthetic data generation, and more.

Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet. Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.</p></details> |  |

Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis, due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait, to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset. We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models, demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for prosthesis-specific tasks.

This paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints. To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric, outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset. Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks. The proposed system provides a reliable and privacy-aware solution for continuous human motion analysis in indoor environments.

Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation, enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions. Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in language-guided pose estimation.

While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%. We also validate the kinematic accuracy of monocular pose estimations through waveform analysis, highlighting strong correlations in joint angle estimations but limitations in velocity estimation. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of monocular pose estimation models in the context of sports, contributing valuable insights for advancing monocular pose estimation techniques in high-performance sports environments.

Our method integrates robust multi-view 2D pose tracking via a transformer-based top-down approach, employing epipolar geometry constraints and long-term video object segmentation for consistent identity tracking across views. Initial 3D poses are obtained through weighted triangulation and spline smoothing, followed by kinematic optimization to refine pose accuracy. We further enhance pose realism and robustness by introducing a multi-person physics-based trajectory optimization step, effectively addressing challenges such as rapid motions, occlusions, and close interactions. Experimental results on diverse datasets, including a new benchmark of elite boxing footage, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we release comprehensive annotated video datasets to advance future research in multi-person pose estimation for combat sports.</p></details> |  |
| **[mmEgoHand: Egocentric Hand Pose Estimation and Gesture Recognition with Head-mounted Millimeter-wave Radar and IMU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13805v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar have demonstrated its potential for human action recognition and pose estimation, offering privacy-preserving advantages over conventional cameras while maintaining occlusion robustness, with promising applications in human-computer interaction and wellness care. However, existing mmWave systems typically employ fixed-position configurations, restricting user mobility to predefined zones and limiting practical deployment scenarios. We introduce mmEgoHand, a head-mounted egocentric system for hand pose estimation to support applications such as gesture recognition, VR interaction, skill digitization and assessment, and robotic teleoperation. mmEgoHand synergistically integrates mmWave radar with inertial measurement units (IMUs) to enable dynamic perception. The IMUs actively compensate for radar interference induced by head movements, while our novel end-to-end Transformer architecture simultaneously estimates 3D hand keypoint coordinates through multi-modal sensor fusion. This dual-modality framework achieves spatial-temporal alignment of mmWave heatmaps with IMUs, overcoming viewpoint instability inherent in egocentric sensing scenarios. We further demonstrate that intermediate hand pose representations substantially improve performance in downstream task, e.g., VR gesture recognition. Extensive evaluations with 10 subjects performing 8 gestures across 3 distinct postures -- standing, sitting, lying -- achieve 90.8% recognition accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by a large margin.

In this paper, we propose Sparse Correlation and Joint Distillation (SCJD), a novel framework that balances efficiency and accuracy for 3D HPE. SCJD introduces Sparse Correlation Input Sequence Downsampling to reduce redundancy in student network inputs while preserving inter-frame correlations. For effective knowledge transfer, we propose Dynamic Joint Spatial Attention Distillation, which includes Dynamic Joint Embedding Distillation to enhance the student's feature representation using the teacher's multi-frame context feature, and Adjacent Joint Attention Distillation to improve the student network's focus on adjacent joint relationships for better spatial understanding. Additionally, Temporal Consistency Distillation aligns the temporal correlations between teacher and student networks through upsampling and global supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCJD achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/wileychan/SCJD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Close Human Interaction with Appearance and Proxemics Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02565v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.

| **[Markerless Stride Length estimation in Athletic using Pose Estimation with monocular vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03016v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance measures such as stride length in athletics and the pace of runners can be estimated using different tricks such as measuring the number of steps divided by the running length or helping with markers printed on the track. Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the gait parameters of athletes.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent noise in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g., 30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation. Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts. Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted in IROS25, Hangzhou, China</p></details> |

This paper presents a test environment that combines a Vehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the feasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and vehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian localization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach through a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations of VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a commercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is generated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and projected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation technique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle perception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP domains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in movement trajectories and joint estimation stability. The validation includes dynamic test scenarios where human avatars, both walking and cycling, are monitored under controlled conditions. Our results show a strong alignment in HPE between RW and CP test conditions for stable motion patterns, while notable inaccuracies persist under dynamic movements and occlusions, particularly for complex cyclist postures. These findings contribute to refining CP testing approaches for evaluating next-generation AI-based vehicle perception and to enhancing interaction models of automated vehicles and VRUs in CP environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Preprint for 2025 IEEE IAVVC (International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference)</p></details> |
| **[Disentangled Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04444v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based methods for monocular 3D human pose estimation have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance by directly regressing the 3D joint coordinates from the 2D pose sequence. Although some methods decompose the task into bone length and bone direction prediction based on the human anatomical skeleton to explicitly incorporate more human body prior constraints, the performance of these methods is significantly lower than that of the SOTA diffusion-based methods. This can be attributed to the tree structure of the human skeleton. Direct application of the disentangled method could amplify the accumulation of hierarchical errors, propagating through each hierarchy. Meanwhile, the hierarchical information has not been fully explored by the previous methods. To address these problems, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser is proposed, termed DDHPose. In our approach: (1) We disentangle the 3D pose and diffuse the bone length and bone direction during the forward process of the diffusion model to effectively model the human pose prior. A disentanglement loss is proposed to supervise diffusion model learning. (2) For the reverse process, we propose Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser (HSTDenoiser) to improve the hierarchical modeling of each joint. Our HSTDenoiser comprises two components: the Hierarchical-Related Spatial Transformer (HRST) and the Hierarchical-Related Temporal Transformer (HRTT). HRST exploits joint spatial information and the influence of the parent joint on each joint for spatial modeling, while HRTT utilizes information from both the joint and its hierarchical adjacent joints to explore the hierarchical temporal correlations among joints.

In this paper, we introduce a novel video segmentation strategy to extract frames of each player's racket swing in a badminton broadcast match. These segmented frames are then processed by two existing models: one for Human Pose Estimation to obtain player skeletal joints, and the other for shuttlecock trajectory detection to extract shuttlecock trajectories. Leveraging these joints, trajectories, and player positions as inputs, we propose Badminton Stroke-type Transformer (BST) to classify player stroke-types in singles. To the best of our knowledge, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the largest publicly available badminton video dataset, ShuttleSet, which shows that effectively leveraging ball trajectory is likely to be a trend for racket sports action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (excluding references)</p></details> |

Advancements in neural networks have significantly alleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports broadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it depends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive game analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match recordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to identify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's flying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying on human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or unavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration method capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted an existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to accurately track player movements. Together, these contributions enable the full 3D reconstruction of a table tennis rally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVSport 2025</p></details> |

However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups, ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at: https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/fishnchips</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2025</p></details> |

Conventional methods either assume high-quality inputs or employ computationally expensive cascaded processing, which limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose STAR-Pose, a spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework specifically designed for video-based human pose estimation. Our method features a novel spatial-temporal Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention, which efficiently captures long-range temporal dependencies. Moreover, it is complemented by an adaptive fusion module that integrates parallel CNN branch for local texture enhancement. We also design a pose-aware compound loss to achieve task-oriented super-resolution. This loss guides the network to reconstruct structural features that are most beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than optimizing purely for visual quality. Extensive experiments on several mainstream video HPE datasets demonstrate that STAR-Pose outperforms existing approaches. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely low-resolution (64x48) conditions while delivering 2.8x to 4.4x faster inference than cascaded approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>14pag...</summary><p>14pages 3figures, alredy submiss to PRCV 2025</p></details> |

Prior work has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human, multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline, leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions. Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods, identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

As a result, they often produce implausible poses under joint occlusions or rapid motion changes. To address these challenges, we propose the PoseGRAF framework. We first construct a dual graph convolutional structure that separately processes joint and bone graphs, effectively capturing their local dependencies. A Cross-Attention module is then introduced to model interdependencies between bone directions and joint features. Building upon this, a dynamic fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate both feature types by leveraging the relational dependencies between joints and bones. An improved Transformer encoder is further incorporated in a residual manner to generate the final output. Experimental results on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches. Additional evaluations on in-the-wild videos further validate its generalizability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/iCityLab/PoseGRAF.</p></details> |  |

However, recent progress on multi-order game-theoretic interaction within deep neural networks (DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where the expressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increased kernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modern ConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning in pure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs. MogaNet encapsulates conceptually simple yet effective convolutions and gated aggregation into a compact module, where discriminative features are efficiently gathered and contextualized adaptively. MogaNet exhibits great scalability, impressive efficiency of parameters, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ViTs and ConvNets on ImageNet and various downstream vision benchmarks, including COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, 2D&3D human pose estimation, and video prediction. Notably, MogaNet hits 80.0% and 87.8% accuracy with 5.2M and 181M parameters on ImageNet-1K, outperforming ParC-Net and ConvNeXt-L, while saving 59% FLOPs and 17M parameters, respectively.

Accurate and efficient solutions are required for several real-world applications including animation, human-robot interaction, surveillance, and sports. However, challenges such as occlusions, 2D pose mismatches, random camera perspectives, and limited 3D labelled data have been hampering the models' performance and limiting their deployment in real-world scenarios. The higher availability of cameras has led researchers to explore multi-view solutions to take advantage of the different perspectives to reconstruct the pose. Most existing reviews have mainly focused on monocular 3D human pose estimation, so a comprehensive survey on multi-view approaches has been missing since 2012. According to the reviewed articles, the majority of the existing methods are fully-supervised approaches based on geometric constraints, which are often limited by 2D pose mismatches. To mitigate this, researchers have proposed incorporating temporal consistency or depth information. Alternatively, working directly with 3D features has been shown to completely overcome this issue, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity. Additionally, models with lower levels of supervision have been identified to help address challenges such as annotated data scarcity and generalisation to new setups. Therefore, no method currently addresses all challenges associated with 3D pose reconstruction, and a trade-off between complexity and performance exists. Further research is needed to develop approaches capable of quickly inferring a highly accurate 3D pose with bearable computation cost. Techniques such as active learning, low-supervision methods, temporal consistency, view selection, depth information estimation, and multi-modal approaches are strategies to consider when developing a new method for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 tables, 6 figures, accepted at Image and Vision Computing (IMAVIS)</p></details> |

However, accurate human joint estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda) Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation, window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error. This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose, with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, this process relies on human demonstrations captured through pose estimation or motion capture systems. In this paper, we explore a text-driven approach to mapping human motion to humanoids. To address the inherent discrepancies between the generated motion representations and the kinematic constraints of humanoid robots, we propose an angle signal network based on norm-position and rotation loss (NPR Loss). It generates joint angles, which serve as inputs to a reinforcement learning-based whole-body joint motion control policy. The policy ensures tracking of the generated motions while maintaining the robot's stability during execution. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, successfully transferring text-driven human motion to a real humanoid robot NAO.</p></details> |  |
| **[LGM-Pose: A Lightweight Global Modeling Network for Real-time Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04561v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Turn: At Home Turning Angle Estimation for Parkinson's Disease Severity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08182v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses. Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on free-living home settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.</p></details> |  |

Our work builds upon state-of-the-art advances in the area of human pose estimation, graph-attention neural networks, and transformer interpretablity. The downstream task is to assist rehabilitation by providing informative feedback to users while they are performing prescribed exercises. We utilize a contrastive learning strategy during training. Given a tuple of correctly and incorrectly executed exercises, our model is able to identify and highlight those joints that are involved in an incorrect movement and thus require the user's attention. We collected an in-house dataset, ExeCheck, with paired recordings of both correct and incorrect execution of exercises. In our experiments, we tested our method on this dataset as well as the UI-PRMD dataset and found ExeCheck outperformed the baseline method using pairwise sequence alignment in identifying joints of physical relevance in rehabilitation exercises.</p></details> |  |

Usually, action coordination is represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA) module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/MingjieWe/PGFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking 3D Human Pose Estimation Models under Occlusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10350v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Pose Estimation (HPE) involves detecting and localizing keypoints on the human body from visual data. In 3D HPE, occlusions, where parts of the body are not visible in the image, pose a significant challenge for accurate pose reconstruction. This paper presents a benchmark on the robustness of 3D HPE models under realistic occlusion conditions, involving combinations of occluded keypoints commonly observed in real-world scenarios. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D HPE models, spanning convolutional, transformer-based, graph-based, and diffusion-based architectures, using the BlendMimic3D dataset, a synthetic dataset with ground-truth 2D/3D annotations and occlusion labels. All models were originally trained on Human3.6M and tested here without retraining to assess their generalization. We introduce a protocol that simulates occlusion by adding noise into 2D keypoints based on real detector behavior, and conduct both global and per-joint sensitivity analyses. Our findings reveal that all models exhibit notable performance degradation under occlusion, with diffusion-based models underperforming despite their stochastic nature. Additionally, a per-joint occlusion analysis identifies consistent vulnerability in distal joints (e.g., wrists, feet) across models. Overall, this work highlights critical limitations of current 3D HPE models in handling occlusions, and provides insights for improving real-world robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improvement of human health lifespan with hybrid group pose estimation methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03169v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human beings rely heavily on estimation of poses in order to access their body movements. Human pose estimation methods take advantage of computer vision advances in order to track human body movements in real life applications. This comes from videos which are recorded through available devices. These para-digms provide potential to make human movement measurement more accessible to users. The consumers of pose estimation movements believe that human poses content tend to supplement available videos. This has increased pose estimation software usage to estimate human poses. In order to address this problem, we develop hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method to improve human health. This proposed hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method aims to detect multi-person poses using modified group pose estimation and modified real time pose estimation. This ensemble allows fusion of performance of stated methods in real time. The input poses from images are fed into individual meth-ods. The pose transformation method helps to identify relevant features for en-semble to perform training effectively. After this, customized pre-trained hybrid ensemble is trained on public benchmarked datasets which is being evaluated through test datasets. The effectiveness and viability of proposed method is estab-lished based on comparative analysis of group pose estimation methods and ex-periments conducted on benchmarked datasets. It provides best optimized results in real-time pose estimation. It makes pose estimation method more robust to oc-clusion and improves dense regression accuracy. These results have affirmed po-tential application of this method in several real-time situations with improvement in human health life span</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantics-aware Test-time Adaptation for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10724v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work highlights a semantics misalignment in 3D human pose estimation. For the task of test-time adaptation, the misalignment manifests as overly smoothed and unguided predictions. The smoothing settles predictions towards some average pose. Furthermore, when there are occlusions or truncations, the adaptation becomes fully unguided. To this end, we pioneer the integration of a semantics-aware motion prior for the test-time adaptation of 3D pose estimation. We leverage video understanding and a well-structured motion-text space to adapt the model motion prediction to adhere to video semantics during test time. Additionally, we incorporate a missing 2D pose completion based on the motion-text similarity. The pose completion strengthens the motion prior's guidance for occlusions and truncations. Our method significantly improves state-of-the-art 3D human pose estimation TTA techniques, with more than 12% decrease in PA-MPJPE on 3DPW and 3DHP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Event-based Egocentric Human Pose Estimation in Dynamic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22007v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating human pose using a front-facing egocentric camera is essential for applications such as sports motion analysis, VR/AR, and AI for wearable devices. However, many existing methods rely on RGB cameras and do not account for low-light environments or motion blur. Event-based cameras have the potential to address these challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel task of human pose estimation using a front-facing event-based camera mounted on the head and propose D-EventEgo, the first framework for this task. The proposed method first estimates the head poses, and then these are used as conditions to generate body poses. However, when estimating head poses, the presence of dynamic objects mixed with background events may reduce head pose estimation accuracy. Therefore, we introduce the Motion Segmentation Module to remove dynamic objects and extract background information. Extensive experiments on our synthetic event-based dataset derived from EgoBody, demonstrate that our approach outperforms our baseline in four out of five evaluation metrics in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICIP 2025, Project Page: https://wataru823.github.io/D-EventEgo/</p></details> |
| **[Spectral Compression Transformer with Line Pose Graph for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21309v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based 3D human pose estimation methods suffer from high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length. Additionally, pose sequences often contain significant redundancy between frames. However, recent methods typically fail to improve model capacity while effectively eliminating sequence redundancy. In this work, we introduce the Spectral Compression Transformer (SCT) to reduce sequence length and accelerate computation. The SCT encoder treats hidden features between blocks as Temporal Feature Signals (TFS) and applies the Discrete Cosine Transform, a Fourier transform-based technique, to determine the spectral components to be retained. By filtering out certain high-frequency noise components, SCT compresses the sequence length and reduces redundancy. To further enrich the input sequence with prior structural information, we propose the Line Pose Graph (LPG) based on line graph theory. The LPG generates skeletal position information that complements the input 2D joint positions, thereby improving the model's performance. Finally, we design a dual-stream network architecture to effectively model spatial joint relationships and the compressed motion trajectory within the pose sequence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency. For example, on the Human3.6M dataset, our method achieves an MPJPE of 37.7mm while maintaining a low computational cost. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on each module to assess its effectiveness. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion for Monocular 3-D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20611v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods for 3-D human pose estimation face significant computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of self-attention mechanism complexity with sequence length. Recently, the Mamba model has substantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding performance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM). However, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3-D joint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution structure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To address these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in this paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction and length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing effective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint sequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba model by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling it to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a Spatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial relationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal topology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing human structural relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets for testing and comparison, and the results show that the proposed method greatly reduces computational cost while achieving higher accuracy. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptHMR: Promptable Human Mesh Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06397v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation presents challenges in diverse scenarios such as crowded scenes, person-person interactions, and single-view reconstruction. Existing approaches lack mechanisms to incorporate auxiliary "side information" that could enhance reconstruction accuracy in such challenging scenarios. Furthermore, the most accurate methods rely on cropped person detections and cannot exploit scene context while methods that process the whole image often fail to detect people and are less accurate than methods that use crops. While recent language-based methods explore HPS reasoning through large language or vision-language models, their metric accuracy is well below the state of the art. In contrast, we present PromptHMR, a transformer-based promptable method that reformulates HPS estimation through spatial and semantic prompts. Our method processes full images to maintain scene context and accepts multiple input modalities: spatial prompts like bounding boxes and masks, and semantic prompts like language descriptions or interaction labels. PromptHMR demonstrates robust performance across challenging scenarios: estimating people from bounding boxes as small as faces in crowded scenes, improving body shape estimation through language descriptions, modeling person-person interactions, and producing temporally coherent motions in videos. Experiments on benchmarks show that PromptHMR achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering flexible prompt-based control over the HPS estimation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[PoseBH: Prototypical Multi-Dataset Training Beyond Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17475v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study multi-dataset training (MDT) for pose estimation, where skeletal heterogeneity presents a unique challenge that existing methods have yet to address. In traditional domains, \eg regression and classification, MDT typically relies on dataset merging or multi-head supervision. However, the diversity of skeleton types and limited cross-dataset supervision complicate integration in pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce PoseBH, a new MDT framework that tackles keypoint heterogeneity and limited supervision through two key techniques. First, we propose nonparametric keypoint prototypes that learn within a unified embedding space, enabling seamless integration across skeleton types. Second, we develop a cross-type self-supervision mechanism that aligns keypoint predictions with keypoint embedding prototypes, providing supervision without relying on teacher-student models or additional augmentations. PoseBH substantially improves generalization across whole-body and animal pose datasets, including COCO-WholeBody, AP-10K, and APT-36K, while preserving performance on standard human pose benchmarks (COCO, MPII, and AIC). Furthermore, our learned keypoint embeddings transfer effectively to hand shape estimation (InterHand2.6M) and human body shape estimation (3DPW).

We utilize an off-the-shelf 3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware navigation. We introduce a human navigation dataset ``DARKO'' with specific focus on navigational activities that are relevant for human-aware mobile robot navigation. We perform extensive evaluation on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and our DARKO dataset.

While emerging technologies are making it easier to capture kinematics with biomechanical models, or how joint angles change over time, inferring the underlying physics that give rise to these movements, including ground reaction forces, joint torques, or even muscle activations, is still challenging. Here we explore whether imitation learning applied to a biomechanical model from a large dataset of movements from able-bodied and impaired individuals can learn to compute these inverse dynamics. Although imitation learning in human pose estimation has seen great interest in recent years, our work differences in several ways: we focus on using an accurate biomechanical model instead of models adopted for computer vision, we test it on a dataset that contains participants with impaired movements, we reported detailed tracking metrics relevant for the clinical measurement of movement including joint angles and ground contact events, and finally we apply imitation learning to a muscle-driven neuromusculoskeletal model. We show that our imitation learning policy, KinTwin, can accurately replicate the kinematics of a wide range of movements, including those with assistive devices or therapist assistance, and that it can infer clinically meaningful differences in joint torques and muscle activations. Our work demonstrates the potential for using imitation learning to enable high-quality movement analysis in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Keypoints as Dynamic Centroids for Unified Human Pose and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12130v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic movement of the human body presents a fundamental challenge for human pose estimation and body segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on combining keypoint heatmaps with segmentation masks but often struggle in scenarios involving overlapping joints or rapidly changing poses during instance-level segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose Keypoints as Dynamic Centroid (KDC), a new centroid-based representation for unified human pose estimation and instance-level segmentation. KDC adopts a bottom-up paradigm to generate keypoint heatmaps for both easily distinguishable and complex keypoints and improves keypoint detection and confidence scores by introducing KeyCentroids using a keypoint disk. It leverages high-confidence keypoints as dynamic centroids in the embedding space to generate MaskCentroids, allowing for swift clustering of pixels to specific human instances during rapid body movements in live environments. Our experimental evaluations on the CrowdPose, OCHuman, and COCO benchmarks demonstrate KDC's effectiveness and generalizability in challenging scenarios in terms of both accuracy and runtime performance.

However, most existing EHPS models focus primarily on minimizing estimation errors, with limited attention on potential security vulnerabilities. Current adversarial attacks on EHPS models often require white-box access (e.g., model details or gradients) or generate visually conspicuous perturbations, limiting their practicality and ability to expose real-world security threats. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Unnoticeable Black-Box Attack (UBA) against EHPS models. UBA leverages the latent-space representations of natural images to generate an optimal adversarial noise pattern and iteratively refine its attack potency along an optimized direction in digital space. Crucially, this process relies solely on querying the model's output, requiring no internal knowledge of the EHPS architecture, while guiding the noise optimization toward greater stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments and visual analyses demonstrate the superiority of UBA. Notably, UBA increases the pose estimation errors of EHPS models by 17.27%-58.21% on average, revealing critical vulnerabilities. These findings underscore the urgent need to address and mitigate security risks associated with digital human generation systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

In practice, however, systems must adapt to diverse viewpoints, environments, and camera setups -- conditions that differ significantly from those encountered during training, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we present a standardized testing environment in which each method is evaluated on a variety of datasets, ensuring consistent and fair cross-dataset comparisons -- allowing for the analysis of methods on previously unseen data. Therefore, we propose PoseBench3D, a unified framework designed to systematically re-evaluate prior and future models across four of the most widely used datasets for human pose estimation -- with the framework able to support novel and future datasets as the field progresses. Through a unified interface, our framework provides datasets in a pre-configured yet easily modifiable format, ensuring compatibility with diverse model architectures. We re-evaluated the work of 18 methods, either trained or gathered from existing literature, and reported results using both Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and Procrustes Aligned Mean Per Joint Position Error (PA-MPJPE) metrics, yielding more than 100 novel cross-dataset evaluation results.

We bridge this gap by leveraging large multimodal models (LMMs) as priors for reconstructing contact poses, offering a scalable alternative to traditional methods that rely on human annotations or motion capture data. Our approach extracts contact-relevant descriptors from an LMM and translates them into tractable losses to constrain 3D human pose optimization. Despite its simplicity, our method produces compelling reconstructions for both two-person interactions and self-contact scenarios, accurately capturing the semantics of physical and social interactions. Our results demonstrate that LMMs can serve as powerful tools for contact prediction and pose estimation, offering an alternative to costly manual human annotations or motion capture data.

However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g. in form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically plausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces and exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current state-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict torques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e. the joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical models, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end, we propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with the kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural Kalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to predict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a physics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to realize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and simulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show that this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps balancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important for not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing physically plausible human poses. The proposed approach excels in the physics-based human pose estimation task and demonstrates the physical plausibility of the predictive dynamics, compared to state of the art.

However, challenges such as pose ambiguity, data drift, and limited adaptability to diverse bodies persist. To address these issues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state estimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six integrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB sensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in resolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with anthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors are affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor data and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF iteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain human motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over state of the art in pose accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

We focus on four-way sleep position classification using data collected from a PSM placed under a mattress in a sleep clinic. Sleep positions can affect sleep quality and the prevalence of sleep disorders, such as apnea. Measurements were performed on patients with suspected sleep disorders referred for assessments at a sleep clinic. Training deep learning models can be challenging in clinical settings due to the need for large amounts of labeled data. To overcome the shortage of labeled training data, we utilize transfer learning to adapt pre-trained deep learning models to accurately estimate sleep positions from a low-resolution PSM dataset collected in a polysomnography sleep lab. Our approach leverages Vision Transformer models pre-trained on ImageNet using masked autoencoding (ViTMAE) and a pre-trained model for human pose estimation (ViTPose). These approaches outperform previous work from PSM-based sleep pose classification using deep learning (TCN) as well as traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) that use engineered features.

Ergonomic assessments can mitigate these risks by identifying workplace adjustments that improve posture and reduce strain. Camera-based systems offer a non-intrusive, cost-effective method for continuous ergonomic tracking, but they also raise significant privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a privacy-aware ergonomic assessment framework utilizing machine learning techniques. Our approach employs adversarial training to develop a lightweight neural network that obfuscates video data, preserving only the essential information needed for human pose estimation. This obfuscation ensures compatibility with standard pose estimation algorithms, maintaining high accuracy while protecting privacy. The obfuscated video data is transmitted to a central server, where state-of-the-art keypoint detection algorithms extract body landmarks. Using multi-view integration, 3D keypoints are reconstructed and evaluated with the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) method. Our system provides a secure, effective solution for ergonomic monitoring in industrial environments, addressing both privacy and workplace safety concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 35th CIRP Design conference</p></details> |

Compared to vision-based systems, full-body pose estimation from sparse tracking signals is not limited by environmental conditions or recording range. However, previous works either face the challenge of wearing additional sensors on the pelvis and lower-body or rely on external visual sensors to obtain global positions of key joints. To improve the practicality of the technology for virtual reality applications, we estimate full-body poses using only inertial data obtained from three Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors worn on the head and wrists, thereby reducing the complexity of the hardware system. In this work, we propose a method called Progressive Inertial Poser (ProgIP) for human pose estimation, which combines neural network estimation with a human dynamics model, considers the hierarchical structure of the kinematic chain, and employs a multi-stage progressive network estimation with increased depth to reconstruct full-body motion in real time. The encoder combines Transformer Encoder and bidirectional LSTM (TE-biLSTM) to flexibly capture the temporal dependencies of the inertial sequence, while the decoder based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) transforms high-dimensional features and accurately projects them onto Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model parameters. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on multiple public datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the same inputs, and is comparable to recent works using six IMU sensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Views Are Better than One: Monocular 3D Pose Estimation with Multiview Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12421v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deducing a 3D human pose from a single 2D image is inherently challenging because multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D representation. 3D data can resolve this pose ambiguity, but it is expensive to record and requires an intricate setup that is often restricted to controlled lab environments. We propose a method that improves the performance of deep learning-based monocular 3D human pose estimation models by using multiview data only during training, but not during inference. We introduce a novel loss function, consistency loss, which operates on two synchronized views. This approach is simpler than previous models that require 3D ground truth or intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. Our consistency loss penalizes differences in two pose sequences after rigid alignment. We also demonstrate that our consistency loss substantially improves performance for fine-tuning without requiring 3D data. Furthermore, we show that using our consistency loss can yield state-of-the-art performance when training models from scratch in a semi-supervised manner. Our findings provide a simple way to capture new data, e.g in a new domain. This data can be added using off-the-shelf cameras with no calibration requirements. We make all our code and data publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, human global motions are still challenging to be reconstructed by IMUs. This paper aims to solve this problem by involving physics. It proposes a physical optimization scheme based on multiple contacts to enable physically plausible translation estimation in the full 3D space where the z-directional motion is usually challenging for previous works. It also considers gravity in local pose estimation which well constrains human global orientations and refines local pose estimation in a joint estimation manner. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate motion capture for both local poses and global motions. Furthermore, by deeply integrating physics, we can also estimate 3D contact, contact forces, joint torques, and interacting proxy surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025.

These developments have led to highly accurate body tracking systems, which have direct applications in sports analysis and performance evaluation. This work analyzes the performance of six trackers: two point trackers and four joint trackers for biomechanical analysis in sprints. The proposed framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames. The experimental framework employs forty sprints from five professional runners, focusing on three key angles in sprint biomechanics: trunk inclination, hip flex extension, and knee flex extension. We propose a post-processing module for outlier detection and fusion prediction in the joint angles. The experimental results demonstrate that using joint-based models yields root mean squared errors ranging from 11.41{\deg} to 4.37{\deg}. When integrated with the post-processing modules, these errors can be reduced to 6.99{\deg} and 3.88{\deg}, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that human pose tracking approaches can be valuable resources for the biomechanical analysis of running. However, there is still room for improvement in applications where high accuracy is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the paper presented to the Third Workshop on Learning with Few or Without Annotated Face, Body, and Gesture Data on 19th IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition 2025</p></details> |

HDiffTG leverages the strengths of these techniques to significantly improve pose estimation accuracy and robustness while maintaining a lightweight design. The Transformer captures global spatiotemporal dependencies, the GCN models local skeletal structures, and the diffusion model provides step-by-step optimization for fine-tuning, achieving a complementary balance between global and local features. This integration enhances the model's ability to handle pose estimation under occlusions and in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce lightweight optimizations to the integrated model and refine the objective function design to reduce computational overhead without compromising performance. Evaluation results on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that HDiffTG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset while excelling in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

While deep learning-based human pose estimation (HPE) models from RGB videos have achieved impressive performance on public datasets, their effectiveness in real-world sports scenarios is often hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts across different pose representations. Fine-tuning these models can partially alleviate such challenges but typically requires large-scale annotated data and still struggles to generalize across diverse sports environments. To address these limitations, we propose a 2D pose prior-guided refinement approach based on Neural Distance Fields (NDF). Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on angular representations of human poses, we introduce a polar coordinate-based representation that explicitly incorporates joint connection lengths, enabling a more accurate correction of erroneous pose estimations. Additionally, we define a novel non-geodesic distance metric that separates angular and radial discrepancies, which we demonstrate is better suited for polar representations than traditional geodesic distances. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a gradient-based batch-projection augmentation strategy, which synthesizes realistic pose samples through iterative refinement. Our method is evaluated on a long jump dataset, demonstrating its ability to improve 2D pose estimation across multiple pose representations, making it robust across different domains. Experimental results show that our approach enhances pose plausibility while requiring only limited training data.

Traditional regression-based methods assume fixed distributions, which might lead to poor UQ. Heatmap-based methods effectively model the output distribution using likelihood heatmaps, however, they demand significant resources. To address this, we propose Continuous Flow Residual Estimation (CFRE), an integration of Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) into regression-based models, which allows for dynamic distribution adaptation. Through extensive experiments, we show that CFRE leads to better accuracy and uncertainty quantification with retained computational efficiency on both 2D and 3D human pose estimation tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by SCIA2025 |

However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Each insole, fabricated with e-textile garment techniques, costs under USD 1, making it significantly cheaper than commercial alternatives and ideal for large-scale production. Our approach uses foot pressure distribution, acceleration, and rotation data to overcome limitations, providing a lightweight, minimally intrusive, and privacy-aware solution. The system employs a Transformer model for efficient temporal feature extraction, enriched by first and second derivatives in the input stream. Including multimodal information, such as accelerometers and rotational measurements, improves the accuracy of complex motion pattern recognition. These facts are demonstrated experimentally, while error metrics show the robustness of the approach in various posture estimation tasks. This work could be the foundation for a low-cost, practical application in rehabilitation, injury prevention, and health monitoring while enabling further development through sensor optimization and expanded datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDM: A Metric for Comparing 3D Shapes Using Directional Distance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09736v5)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Qualifying the discrepancy between 3D geometric models, which could be represented with either point clouds or triangle meshes, is a pivotal issue with board applications. Existing methods mainly focus on directly establishing the correspondence between two models and then aggregating point-wise distance between corresponding points, resulting in them being either inefficient or ineffective. In this paper, we propose DDM, an efficient, effective, robust, and differentiable distance metric for 3D geometry data. Specifically, we construct DDM based on the proposed implicit representation of 3D models, namely directional distance field (DDF), which defines the directional distances of 3D points to a model to capture its local surface geometry. We then transfer the discrepancy between two 3D geometric models as the discrepancy between their DDFs defined on an identical domain, naturally establishing model correspondence. To demonstrate the advantage of our DDM, we explore various distance metric-driven 3D geometric modeling tasks, including template surface fitting, rigid registration, non-rigid registration, scene flow estimation and human pose optimization. Extensive experiments show that our DDM achieves significantly higher accuracy under all tasks. As a generic distance metric, DDM has the potential to advance the field of 3D geometric modeling.

This study focuses on dance style recognition using features extracted using Laban Movement Analysis. Previous studies for dance style recognition often focus on cross-frame movement analysis, which limits the ability to capture temporal context and dynamic transitions between movements. This gap highlights the need for a method that can add temporal context to LMA features. For this, we introduce a novel pipeline which combines 3D pose estimation, 3D human mesh reconstruction, and floor aware body modeling to effectively extract LMA features. To address the temporal limitation, we propose a sliding window approach that captures movement evolution across time in features. These features are then used to train various machine learning methods for classification, and their explainability explainable AI methods to evaluate the contribution of each feature to classification performance. Our proposed method achieves a highest classification accuracy of 99.18\% which shows that the addition of temporal context significantly improves dance style recognition performance.</p></details> |  |

Many challenges make the reconstruction difficult due to (1) actors occluding with each other and having diverse facial expressions, (2) cluttered stages, and (3) small baseline views or sudden shot changes. To address these issues, we present ShowMak3r, a comprehensive reconstruction pipeline that allows the editing of scenes like how video clips are made in a production control room. In ShowMak3r, a 3DLocator module locates recovered actors on the stage using depth prior and estimates unseen human poses via interpolation. The proposed ShotMatcher module then tracks the actors under shot changes. Furthermore, ShowMak3r introduces a face-fitting network that dynamically recovers the actors' expressions. Experiments on Sitcoms3D dataset show that our pipeline can reassemble TV show scenes with new cameras at different timestamps. We also demonstrate that ShowMak3r enables interesting applications such as synthetic shot-making, actor relocation, insertion, deletion, and pose manipulation.

While existing research primarily focuses on reducing estimation errors, it largely neglects robustness and security aspects, leaving these systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To address this significant challenge, we propose the \textbf{Tangible Attack (TBA)}, a novel framework designed to generate adversarial examples capable of effectively compromising any digital human generation model. Our approach introduces a \textbf{Dual Heterogeneous Noise Generator (DHNG)}, which leverages Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and ControlNet to produce diverse, targeted noise tailored to the original image features. Additionally, we design a custom \textbf{adversarial loss function} to optimize the noise, ensuring both high controllability and potent disruption. By iteratively refining the adversarial sample through multi-gradient signals from both the noise and the state-of-the-art EHPS model, TBA substantially improves the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate TBA's superiority, achieving a remarkable 41.0\% increase in estimation error, with an average improvement of approximately 17.0\%. These findings expose significant security vulnerabilities in current EHPS models and highlight the need for stronger defenses in digital human generation systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

In this study, we proposed a novel architecture named Transformer based Encoder Decoder Network (TED Net) designed for estimating human skeleton poses from WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). TED Net integrates convolutional encoders with transformer based attention mechanisms to capture spatiotemporal features from CSI signals. The estimated skeleton poses were used as input to a customized Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) for action recognition. We validated our model on two datasets: a publicly available multi modal dataset for assessing general pose estimation, and a newly collected dataset focused on fall related scenarios involving 20 participants. Experimental results demonstrated that TED Net outperformed existing approaches in pose estimation, and that the DGNN achieves reliable action classification using CSI based skeletons, with performance comparable to RGB based systems. Notably, TED Net maintains robust performance across both fall and non fall cases. These findings highlight the potential of CSI driven human skeleton estimation for effective action recognition, particularly in home environments such as elderly fall detection. In such settings, WiFi signals are often readily available, offering a privacy preserving alternative to vision based methods, which may raise concerns about continuous camera monitoring.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Among these factors, camera viewpoints and locations {have been shown} to contribute significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create 360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a \textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation, respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model} based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.

Existing methods reduce the optimization time by decreasing the number of Gaussians or by improving the implementation of the differentiable rasterizer. However, they still rely on the ADAM optimizer to fit Gaussian parameters of a scene in thousands of iterations, which can take up to an hour. To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 20% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that acclerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

| **[Enhancing Novel View Synthesis from extremely sparse views with SfM-free 3D Gaussian Splatting Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15457v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse, the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes, resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs 3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches, achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details, resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[GALA: Guided Attention with Language Alignment for Open Vocabulary Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14278v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity, yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings. This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriveSplat: Decoupled Driving Scene Reconstruction with Geometry-enhanced Partitioned Neural Gaussians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15376v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles, pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near, middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation. Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors, whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network. The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-Conditioned 3D Gaussian Splat Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15372v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks. This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating. Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

However, while many methods focus on geometric consistency, they often neglect the potential of text-driven guidance to enhance semantic understanding, which is crucial for accurately reconstructing fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose TextSplat--the first text-driven Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework. By employing a text-guided fusion of diverse semantic cues, our framework learns robust cross-modal feature representations that improve the alignment of geometric and semantic information, producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Specifically, our framework employs three parallel modules to obtain complementary representations: the Diffusion Prior Depth Estimator for accurate depth information, the Semantic Aware Segmentation Network for detailed semantic information, and the Multi-View Interaction Network for refined cross-view features. Then, in the Text-Guided Semantic Fusion Module, these representations are integrated via the text-guided and attention-based feature aggregation mechanism, resulting in enhanced 3D Gaussian parameters enriched with detailed semantic cues. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[MeSS: City Mesh-Guided Outdoor Scene Generation with Cross-View Consistent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15169v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however, the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS (Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure) using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these, we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSFix3D: Diffusion-Guided Repair of Novel Views in Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14717v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile, diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available. Project page: https://gsfix3d.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Most existing radiance-field-based SLAM systems mainly focus on bounded indoor environments, equipped with RGB-D or RGB sensors. However, they are prone to decline when expanding to unbounded scenes or encountering adverse conditions, such as violent motions and changing illumination. In contrast, oriented to general scenarios, our approach additionally tightly fuses LiDAR, IMU, and camera for robust pose estimation and photo-realistic online mapping. To compensate for regions unobserved by the LiDAR, we propose to integrate both the triangulated visual points from images and LiDAR points for initializing 3D Gaussians. In addition, the modeling of the sky and varying camera exposure have been realized for high-quality rendering. Notably, we implement our system purely with C++ and CUDA, and meticulously design a series of strategies to accelerate the online optimization of the Gaussian-based scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms its counterparts while maintaining real-time capability. Impressively, regarding photo-realistic mapping, our method with our estimated poses even surpasses all the compared approaches that utilize privileged ground-truth poses for mapping. Our code has been released on https://github.com/APRIL-ZJU/Gaussian-LIC.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[GeMS: Efficient Gaussian Splatting for Extreme Motion Blur](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14682v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and (3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results, inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this, we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events: (4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from severely blurred inputs.</p></details> |  |

Although NeRF-based methods achieve high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties, leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models. Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we present a novel unsupervised framework for reconstructing 3D anatomical structures from freehand 2D transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) sweeps, without requiring external tracking or learned pose estimators. Our method adapts the principles of Gaussian Splatting to the domain of ultrasound, introducing a slice-aware, differentiable rasterizer tailored to the unique physics and geometry of ultrasound imaging. We model anatomy as a collection of anisotropic 3D Gaussians and optimize their parameters directly from image-level supervision, leveraging sensorless probe motion estimation and domain-specific geometric priors. The result is a compact, flexible, and memory-efficient volumetric representation that captures anatomical detail with high spatial fidelity. This work demonstrates that accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D ultrasound images can be achieved through purely computational means, offering a scalable alternative to conventional 3D systems and enabling new opportunities for AI-assisted analysis and diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

Agricultural scenes present unique challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth, and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions. By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI, NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat, highlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios.

However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians, resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS, noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles, achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Previous studies have employed dense SLAM techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction. However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage. However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in 3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.</p></details> |  |

Previous works utilize neural fields together with physically based rendering (PBR), to estimate geometry and disentangle appearance properties of human avatars. However, one drawback of these methods is the slow rendering speed due to the expensive Monte Carlo ray tracing. To tackle this problem, we proposed to distill the knowledge from implicit neural fields (teacher) to explicit 2D Gaussian splatting (student) representation to take advantage of the fast rasterization property of Gaussian splatting. To avoid ray-tracing, we employ the split-sum approximation for PBR appearance. We also propose novel part-wise ambient occlusion probes for shadow computation. Shadow prediction is achieved by querying these probes only once per pixel, which paves the way for real-time relighting of avatars. These techniques combined give high-quality relighting results with realistic shadow effects. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed student model achieves comparable or even better relighting results with our teacher model while being 370 times faster at inference time, achieving a 67 FPS rendering speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, ICCV 2025 Findings Oral, Project pages: https://jzr99.github.io/DNF-Avatar/</p></details> |

They typically rely on pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image, enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets, annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism, where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

Its ability to render complex scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances, a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases.

Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for demanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked objects to guide the user during scanning.

However, most existing methods rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, limiting their ability to capture detailed scenes in high-contrast environments. While some prior works address high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, they typically require multi-view sharp images with varying exposure times captured at fixed camera positions, which is time-consuming and impractical. To make data acquisition more flexible, we propose \textbf{Casual3DHDR}, a robust one-stage method that reconstructs 3D HDR scenes from casually-captured auto-exposure (AE) videos, even under severe motion blur and unknown, varying exposure times. Our approach integrates a continuous-time camera trajectory into a unified physical imaging model, jointly optimizing exposure times, camera trajectory, and the camera response function (CRF).

| **[Quantifying and Alleviating Co-Adaptation in Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12720v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in novel view synthesis under dense-view settings. However, in sparse-view scenarios, despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians, i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians. The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Existing methods struggle under sparse view conditions, relying on inefficient per-scene multi-view optimizations, which are impractical for many real-world tasks. To address this, we propose SLGaussian, a feed-forward method for constructing 3D semantic fields from sparse viewpoints, allowing direct inference of 3DGS-based scenes. By ensuring consistent SAM segmentations through video tracking and using low-dimensional indexing for high-dimensional CLIP features, SLGaussian efficiently embeds language information in 3D space, offering a robust solution for accurate 3D scene understanding under sparse view conditions. In experiments on two-view sparse 3D object querying and segmentation in the LERF and 3D-OVS datasets, SLGaussian outperforms existing methods in chosen IoU, Localization Accuracy, and mIoU. Moreover, our model achieves scene inference in under 30 seconds and open-vocabulary querying in just 0.011 seconds per query.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025.

| **[Quadratic Gaussian Splatting: High Quality Surface Reconstruction with Second-order Geometric Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16392v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Quadratic Gaussian Splatting (QGS), a novel representation that replaces static primitives with deformable quadric surfaces (e.g., ellipse, paraboloids) to capture intricate geometry. Unlike prior works that rely on Euclidean distance for primitive density modeling--a metric misaligned with surface geometry under deformation--QGS introduces geodesic distance-based density distributions. This innovation ensures that density weights adapt intrinsically to the primitive curvature, preserving consistency during shape changes (e.g., from planar disks to curved paraboloids). By solving geodesic distances in closed form on quadric surfaces, QGS enables surface-aware splatting, where a single primitive can represent complex curvature that previously required dozens of planar surfels, potentially reducing memory usage while maintaining efficient rendering via fast ray-quadric intersection. Experiments on DTU, Tanks and Temples, and MipNeRF360 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art surface reconstruction, with QGS reducing geometric error (chamfer distance) by 33% over 2DGS and 27% over GOF on the DTU dataset. Crucially, QGS retains competitive appearance quality, bridging the gap between geometric precision and visual fidelity for applications like robotics and immersive reality.</p></details> | 16pages,18figures |

Many of these scenarios are time-sensitive, requiring rapid scene encoding while also being data-intensive, necessitating scalable solutions. Deploying these representations on robots with limited computational resources further adds to the challenge. To address this, we introduce SLAG, a multi-GPU framework for language-augmented Gaussian splatting that enhances the speed and scalability of embedding large scenes. Our method integrates 2D visual-language model features into 3D scenes using SAM and CLIP. Unlike prior approaches, SLAG eliminates the need for a loss function to compute per-Gaussian language embeddings. Instead, it derives embeddings from 3D Gaussian scene parameters via a normalized weighted average, enabling highly parallelized scene encoding. Additionally, we introduce a vector database for efficient embedding storage and retrieval. Our experiments show that SLAG achieves an 18 times speedup in embedding computation on a 16-GPU setup compared to OpenGaussian, while preserving embedding quality on the ScanNet and LERF datasets.

In this work, we present a comprehensive improvement to the densification pipeline of 3DGS from three perspectives: when to densify, how to densify, and how to mitigate overfitting. Specifically, we propose an Edge-Aware Score to effectively select candidate Gaussians for splitting. We further introduce a Long-Axis Split strategy that reduces geometric distortions introduced by clone and split operations. To address overfitting, we design a set of techniques, including Recovery-Aware Pruning, Multi-step Update, and Growth Control. Our method enhances rendering fidelity without introducing additional training or inference overhead, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer Gaussians.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xiaobin2001.github.io/improved-gs-web</p></details> |

While recent advances have made impressive progress, most methods still unify all background elements into a single representation, hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the 3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are available at our project page.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

However, it falls short when dealing with glossy surfaces, resulting in visible holes in these areas. We find that the reflection discontinuity causes the issue. To fit the jump from diffuse to specular reflection at different viewing angles, depth bias is introduced in the optimized Gaussian primitives. To address that, we first replace the depth distortion loss in 2DGS with a novel depth convergence loss, which imposes a strong constraint on depth continuity. Then, we rectify the depth criterion in determining the actual surface, which fully accounts for all the intersecting Gaussians along the ray. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations across various datasets reveal that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality, with more complete and accurate surfaces than 2DGS.

In this paper, we propose a novel computational imaging framework that overcomes these obstacles by integrating a hybrid image pre-processing pipeline with a joint pose estimation and 3D reconstruction module based on controlled Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Branch-and-Bound (BnB) search. We validate our approach on both synthetic satellite datasets and on-sky observations of China's Tiangong Space Station and the International Space Station, achieving robust 3D reconstructions of low-Earth orbit satellites from ground-based data. Quantitative evaluations using SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and Chamfer Distance demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based approaches, and ablation studies confirm the critical role of each component. Our framework enables high-fidelity 3D satellite monitoring from Earth, offering a cost-effective alternative for space situational awareness.

In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at github.com/spatial-intelligence-ai/Remove360.git.

| **[GBR: Generative Bundle Refinement for High-fidelity Gaussian Splatting with Enhanced Mesh Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05908v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian splatting has gained attention for its efficient representation and rendering of 3D scenes using continuous Gaussian primitives. However, it struggles with sparse-view inputs due to limited geometric and photometric information, causing ambiguities in depth, shape, and texture. we propose GBR: Generative Bundle Refinement, a method for high-fidelity Gaussian splatting and meshing using only 4-6 input views. GBR integrates a neural bundle adjustment module to enhance geometry accuracy and a generative depth refinement module to improve geometry fidelity. More specifically, the neural bundle adjustment module integrates a foundation network to produce initial 3D point maps and point matches from unposed images, followed by bundle adjustment optimization to improve multiview consistency and point cloud accuracy. The generative depth refinement module employs a diffusion-based strategy to enhance geometric details and fidelity while preserving the scale. Finally, for Gaussian splatting optimization, we propose a multimodal loss function incorporating depth and normal consistency, geometric regularization, and pseudo-view supervision, providing robust guidance under sparse-view conditions. Experiments on widely used datasets show that GBR significantly outperforms existing methods under sparse-view inputs. Additionally, GBR demonstrates the ability to reconstruct and render large-scale real-world scenes, such as the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Great Wall, with remarkable details using only 6 views.</p></details> |  |
| **[Versatile Video Tokenization with Generative 2D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11183v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp., lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction, while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality, outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers comparable compression performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCL-LGS: Contrastive Codebook Learning for 3D Language Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20469v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D reconstruction techniques and vision-language models have fueled significant progress in 3D semantic understanding, a capability critical to robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality. However, methods that rely on 2D priors are prone to a critical challenge: cross-view semantic inconsistencies induced by occlusion, image blur, and view-dependent variations. These inconsistencies, when propagated via projection supervision, deteriorate the quality of 3D Gaussian semantic fields and introduce artifacts in the rendered outputs. To mitigate this limitation, we propose CCL-LGS, a novel framework that enforces view-consistent semantic supervision by integrating multi-view semantic cues. Specifically, our approach first employs a zero-shot tracker to align a set of SAM-generated 2D masks and reliably identify their corresponding categories. Next, we utilize CLIP to extract robust semantic encodings across views. Finally, our Contrastive Codebook Learning (CCL) module distills discriminative semantic features by enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness. In contrast to previous methods that directly apply CLIP to imperfect masks, our framework explicitly resolves semantic conflicts while preserving category discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL-LGS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at https://epsilontl.github.io/CCL-LGS/.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).</p></details> |  |

However, its rendering speed and model size still present bottlenecks, especially in resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we identify and address two key inefficiencies in 3D-GS to substantially improve rendering speed. These improvements also yield the ancillary benefits of reduced model size and training time. First, we optimize the rendering pipeline to precisely localize Gaussians in the scene, boosting rendering speed without altering visual fidelity. Second, we introduce a novel pruning technique and integrate it into the training pipeline, significantly reducing model size and training time while further raising rendering speed. Our Speedy-Splat approach combines these techniques to accelerate average rendering speed by a drastic $\mathit{6.71\times}$ across scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://speedysplat.github.io/</p></details> |

Conversely, the dynamic neural surface directs the distribution of Gaussian primitives around the surface, enhancing rendering quality. In addition, we propose a depth-filtering approach to further refine depth supervision.

The two tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of 3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions, while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and decoding time.</p></details> |  |

Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel approach for rapid scene capture.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 5 Tables, accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |

However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction capability of 3DGS.

| **[Toward Human-Robot Teaming: Learning Handover Behaviors from 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09855v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-robot teaming (HRT) systems often rely on large-scale datasets of human and robot interactions, especially for close-proximity collaboration tasks such as human-robot handovers. Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although simulation training offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation. We introduce a method for training HRT policies, focusing on human-to-robot handovers, solely from RGB images without the need for real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The goal is to enable the robot to reliably receive objects from a human with stable grasping while avoiding collisions with the human hand. The proposed policy learner leverages sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover task, contributing to more seamless and robust HRT.</p></details> | 3 pages, 3 figures |

While recent approaches have sought to leverage generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations. To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs. The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

We propose the DualPhys-GS framework to achieve high-quality underwater reconstruction through a dual-path optimization mechanism. Our approach further develops a dual feature-guided attenuation-scattering modeling mechanism, the RGB-guided attenuation optimization model combines RGB features and depth information and can handle edge and structural details. In contrast, the multi-scale depth-aware scattering model captures scattering effects at different scales using a feature pyramid network and an attention mechanism. Meanwhile, we design several special loss functions. The attenuation scattering consistency loss ensures physical consistency. The water body type adaptive loss dynamically adjusts the weighting coefficients. The edge-aware scattering loss is used to maintain the sharpness of structural edges. The multi-scale feature loss helps to capture global and local structural information. In addition, we design a scene adaptive mechanism that can automatically identify the water-body-type characteristics (e.g., clear coral reef waters or turbid coastal waters) and dynamically adjust the scattering and attenuation parameters and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods in several metrics, especially in suspended matter-dense regions and long-distance scenes, and the reconstruction quality is significantly improved.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we aim to develop a simple yet effective method called NeuralGS that compresses the original 3DGS into a compact representation. Our observation is that neural fields like NeRF can represent complex 3D scenes with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using only a few megabytes. Thus, NeuralGS effectively adopts the neural field representation to encode the attributes of 3D Gaussians with MLPs, only requiring a small storage size even for a large-scale scene. To achieve this, we adopt a clustering strategy and fit the Gaussians within each cluster using different tiny MLPs, based on importance scores of Gaussians as fitting weights. We experiment on multiple datasets, achieving a 91-times average model size reduction without harming the visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-yuangroup.github.io/NeuralGS/</p></details> |
| **[SkySplat: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting from Multi-Temporal Sparse Satellite Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09479v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential, but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable 3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy. It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to 1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Differentiable Hardware Rasterization for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18764v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works demonstrate the advantages of hardware rasterization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in forward-pass rendering through fast GPU-optimized graphics and fixed memory footprint. However, extending these benefits to backward-pass gradient computation remains challenging due to graphics pipeline constraints. We present a differentiable hardware rasterizer for 3DGS that overcomes the memory and performance limitations of tile-based software rasterization. Our solution employs programmable blending for per-pixel gradient computation combined with a hybrid gradient reduction strategy (quad-level + subgroup) in fragment shaders, achieving over 10x faster backward rasterization versus naive atomic operations and 3x speedup over the canonical tile-based rasterizer. Systematic evaluation reveals 16-bit render targets (float16 and unorm16) as the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off, achieving higher gradient accuracy among mixed-precision rendering formats with execution speeds second only to unorm8, while float32 texture incurs severe forward pass performance degradation due to suboptimal hardware optimizations. Our method with float16 formats demonstrates 3.07x acceleration in full pipeline execution (forward + backward passes) on RTX4080 GPUs with the MipNeRF 360 dataset, outperforming the baseline tile-based renderer while preserving hardware rasterization's memory efficiency advantages -- incurring merely 2.67% of the memory overhead required for splat sorting operations. This work presents a unified differentiable hardware rasterization method that simultaneously optimizes runtime and memory usage for 3DGS, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained devices with limited memory capacity.</p></details> | 8 pages,2 figures |
| **[3D Gaussian Splatting Driven Multi-View Robust Physical Adversarial Camouflage Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01367v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons, prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of PGA.

Existing vision-only methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU, respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6% communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited communication budgets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A new dataset and comparison for multi-camera frame synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09068v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques. Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However, most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches. We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening. Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.</p></details> | <details><summary>SPIE2...</summary><p>SPIE2025 - Applications of Digital Image Processing XLVIII accepted manuscript</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-Direction-Aware Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09239v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control. Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized Gaussians utilization.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy. Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing changes over different times</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, motion blur often occurs in videos due to camera shake and object movement, while existing methods render blurry results when using such videos for reconstructing 4D models. Although a few approaches attempted to address the problem, they struggled to produce high-quality results, due to the inaccuracy in estimating continuous dynamic representations within the exposure time. Encouraged by recent works in 3D motion trajectory modeling using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), we take 3DGS as the scene representation manner, and propose Deblur4DGS to reconstruct a high-quality 4D model from blurry monocular video. Specifically, we transform continuous dynamic representations estimation within an exposure time into the exposure time estimation. Moreover, we introduce the exposure regularization term, multi-frame, and multi-resolution consistency regularization term to avoid trivial solutions. Furthermore, to better represent objects with large motion, we suggest blur-aware variable canonical Gaussians. Beyond novel-view synthesis, Deblur4DGS can be applied to improve blurry video from multiple perspectives, including deblurring, frame interpolation, and video stabilization. Extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world data on the above four tasks show that Deblur4DGS outperforms state-of-the-art 4D reconstruction methods.

| **[Communication Efficient Robotic Mixed Reality with Gaussian Splatting Cross-Layer Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08624v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realizing low-cost communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR (GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS model, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this end, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or not) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across different frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO problem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm that reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional branch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are presented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method achieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and legged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios. For the first time, it is found that RoboMR can be achieved with ultra-low communication costs, and mixture of data is useful for enhancing GS performance in dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 18 figures, to appear in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking</p></details> |

This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm.

Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU) benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of 2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and robotic applications.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

However, current methods still face two major challenges: (1) multi-view inconsistency often leads to style conflicts, resulting in appearance smoothing and distortion; and (2) heavy reliance on VGG features, which struggle to disentangle style and content from style images, often causing content leakage and excessive stylization. To tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{FantasyStyle}, a 3DGS-based style transfer framework, and the first to rely entirely on diffusion model distillation. It comprises two key components: (1) \textbf{Multi-View Frequency Consistency}. We enhance cross-view consistency by applying a 3D filter to multi-view noisy latent, selectively reducing low-frequency components to mitigate stylized prior conflicts. (2) \textbf{Controllable Stylized Distillation}. To suppress content leakage from style images, we introduce negative guidance to exclude undesired content. In addition, we identify the limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and Delta Denoising Score in 3D style transfer and remove the reconstruction term accordingly. Building on these insights, we propose a controllable stylized distillation that leverages negative guidance to more effectively optimize the 3D Gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher stylization quality and visual realism across various scenes and styles.</p></details> |  |

However, Current data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios. Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality. Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation, termed GaussianFlowOcc, which is inspired by Gaussian Splatting and replaces traditional dense voxel grids with a sparse 3D Gaussian representation. Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Conventional methods often decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on ScanNet.

| **[3D Gaussian Splatting Data Compression with Mixture of Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03310v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data compression is crucial for enabling efficient storage and transmission in 3D scene modeling. However, its development remains limited due to inadequate entropy models and suboptimal quantization strategies for both lossless and lossy compression scenarios, where existing methods have yet to 1) fully leverage hyperprior information to construct robust conditional entropy models, and 2) apply fine-grained, element-wise quantization strategies for improved compression granularity. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture of Priors (MoP) strategy to simultaneously address these two challenges. Specifically, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, our MoP approach processes hyperprior information through multiple lightweight MLPs to generate diverse prior features, which are subsequently integrated into the MoP feature via a gating mechanism. To enhance lossless compression, the resulting MoP feature is utilized as a hyperprior to improve conditional entropy modeling. Meanwhile, for lossy compression, we employ the MoP feature as guidance information in an element-wise quantization procedure, leveraging a prior-guided Coarse-to-Fine Quantization (C2FQ) strategy with a predefined quantization step value. Specifically, we expand the quantization step value into a matrix and adaptively refine it from coarse to fine granularity, guided by the MoP feature, thereby obtaining a quantization step matrix that facilitates element-wise quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed 3DGS data compression framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including Mip-NeRF360, BungeeNeRF, DeepBlending, and Tank&Temples.</p></details> |  |

I created a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models using both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the USAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the development of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and enhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the Blender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality novel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My investigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original ground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This augmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which was then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only the original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian Splatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve photogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable information for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and autonomous vehicle simulations.

Learned simulators have emerged as a possibility to capture real world physics directly from video data, but very often require privileged information such as depth information, particle tracks and hand-engineered features to maintain spatial and temporal consistency. These strong inductive biases or ground truth 3D information help in domains where data is sparse but limit scalability and generalization in data rich regimes. To overcome the key limitations, we propose 3DGSim, a learned 3D simulator that directly learns physical interactions from multi-view RGB videos. 3DGSim unifies 3D scene reconstruction, particle dynamics prediction and video synthesis into an end-to-end trained framework. It adopts MVSplat to learn a latent particle-based representation of 3D scenes, a Point Transformer for particle dynamics, a Temporal Merging module for consistent temporal aggregation and Gaussian Splatting to produce novel view renderings. By jointly training inverse rendering and dynamics forecasting, 3DGSim embeds the physical properties into point-wise latent features. This enables the model to capture diverse physical behaviors, from rigid to elastic, cloth-like dynamics, and boundary conditions (e.g. fixed cloth corner), along with realistic lighting effects that also generalize to unseen multibody interactions and novel scene edits.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIP-GS: Deep Image Prior For Gaussian Splatting Sparse View Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07372v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a leading 3D scene reconstruction method, obtaining high-quality reconstruction with real-time rendering runtime performance. The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a collection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given views of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of many views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input views are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In this paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation. By using the DIP prior, which utilizes internal structure and patterns, with coarse-to-fine manner, DIP-based 3DGS can operate in scenarios where vanilla 3DGS fails, such as sparse view recovery. Note that our approach does not use any pre-trained models such as generative models and depth estimation, but rather relies only on the input frames. Among such methods, DIP-GS obtains state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitive results on various sparse-view reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[GS4Buildings: Prior-Guided Gaussian Splatting for 3D Building Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07355v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated its effectiveness in photo-realistic rendering and 3D reconstruction. Among these, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface reconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated normal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale and complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete building reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided Gaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building models for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of relying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings initializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic 3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the planar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process, providing strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural accuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits reconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian primitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation. Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%. These results highlight the potential of semantic building model integration to advance GS-based reconstruction toward real-world urban applications such as smart cities and digital twins.

Existing approaches based on volumetric rendering obtain promising results, but optimize on a per-scene basis, resulting in a slow optimization that can struggle to model under-observed or textureless regions. We introduce QuickSplat, which learns data-driven priors to generate dense initializations for 2D gaussian splatting optimization of large-scale indoor scenes. This provides a strong starting point for the reconstruction, which accelerates the convergence of the optimization and improves the geometry of flat wall structures. We further learn to jointly estimate the densification and update of the scene parameters during each iteration; our proposed densifier network predicts new Gaussians based on the rendering gradients of existing ones, removing the needs of heuristics for densification. Extensive experiments on large-scale indoor scene reconstruction demonstrate the superiority of our data-driven optimization. Concretely, we accelerate runtime by 8x, while decreasing depth errors by up to 48% in comparison to state of the art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

However, the robustness of these watermarking techniques against potential attacks remains underexplored. This paper introduces the first universal black-box attack framework, the Group-based Multi-objective Evolutionary Attack (GMEA), designed to challenge these watermarking systems. We formulate the attack as a large-scale multi-objective optimization problem, balancing watermark removal with visual quality. In a black-box setting, we introduce an indirect objective function that blinds the watermark detector by minimizing the standard deviation of features extracted by a convolutional network, thus rendering the feature maps uninformative. To manage the vast search space of 3DGS models, we employ a group-based optimization strategy to partition the model into multiple, independent sub-optimization problems. Experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively removes both 1D and 2D watermarks from mainstream 3DGS watermarking methods while maintaining high visual fidelity. This work reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing 3DGS copyright protection schemes and calls for the development of more robust watermarking systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Gaussian Representations with Motion Trajectory Field for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07182v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of novel-view synthesis and motion reconstruction of dynamic scenes from monocular video, which is critical for many robotic applications. Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable success in rendering static scenes, extending them to reconstruct dynamic scenes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that combines 3DGS with a motion trajectory field, enabling precise handling of complex object motions and achieving physically plausible motion trajectories. By decoupling dynamic objects from static background, our method compactly optimizes the motion trajectory field. The approach incorporates time-invariant motion coefficients and shared motion trajectory bases to capture intricate motion patterns while minimizing optimization complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in both novel-view synthesis and motion trajectory recovery from monocular video, advancing the capabilities of dynamic scene reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[DexFruit: Dexterous Manipulation and Gaussian Splatting Inspection of Fruit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07118v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DexFruit is a robotic manipulation framework that enables gentle, autonomous handling of fragile fruit and precise evaluation of damage. Many fruits are fragile and prone to bruising, thus requiring humans to manually harvest them with care. In this work, we demonstrate by using optical tactile sensing, autonomous manipulation of fruit with minimal damage can be achieved. We show that our tactile informed diffusion policies outperform baselines in both reduced bruising and pick-and-place success rate across three fruits: strawberries, tomatoes, and blackberries. In addition, we introduce FruitSplat, a novel technique to represent and quantify visual damage in high-resolution 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Existing metrics for measuring damage lack quantitative rigor or require expensive equipment. With FruitSplat, we distill a 2D strawberry mask as well as a 2D bruise segmentation mask into the 3DGS representation. Furthermore, this representation is modular and general, compatible with any relevant 2D model. Overall, we demonstrate a 92% grasping policy success rate, up to a 20% reduction in visual bruising, and up to an 31% improvement in grasp success rate on challenging fruit compared to our baselines across our three tested fruits. We rigorously evaluate this result with over 630 trials. Please checkout our website at https://dex-fruit.github.io .</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, these 3DGS generative compression techniques introduce unique distortions lacking systematic quality assessment research. To this end, we establish 3DGS-VBench, a large-scale Video Quality Assessment (VQA) Dataset and Benchmark with 660 compressed 3DGS models and video sequences generated from 11 scenes across 6 SOTA 3DGS compression algorithms with systematically designed parameter levels. With annotations from 50 participants, we obtained MOS scores with outlier removal and validated dataset reliability. We benchmark 6 3DGS compression algorithms on storage efficiency and visual quality, and evaluate 15 quality assessment metrics across multiple paradigms. Our work enables specialized VQA model training for 3DGS, serving as a catalyst for compression and quality assessment research.

| **[ROODI: Reconstructing Occluded Objects with Denoising Inpainters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10256v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the quality of novel-view images has improved dramatically with 3D Gaussian Splatting, extracting specific objects from scenes remains challenging. Isolating individual 3D Gaussian primitives for each object and handling occlusions in scenes remains far from being solved. We propose a novel object extraction method based on two key principles: (1) object-centric reconstruction through removal of irrelevant primitives; and (2) leveraging generative inpainting to compensate for missing observations caused by occlusions. For pruning, we propose to remove irrelevant Gaussians by looking into how close they are to its K-nearest neighbors and removing those that are statistical outliers. Importantly, these distances must take into account the actual spatial extent they cover -- we thus propose to use Wasserstein distances. For inpainting, we employ an off-the-shelf diffusion-based inpainter combined with occlusion reasoning, utilizing the 3D representation of the entire scene. Our findings highlight the crucial synergy between proper pruning and inpainting, both of which significantly enhance extraction performance. We evaluate our method on a standard real-world dataset and introduce a synthetic dataset for quantitative analysis. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, demonstrating its effectiveness in object extraction from complex scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yeonjin-chang.github.io/ROODI/</p></details> |

However, existing GS-SLAM systems perform poorly under persistent and severe motion blur commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, leading to significantly degraded tracking accuracy and compromised 3D reconstruction quality. To address this limitation, we propose EGS-SLAM, a novel GS-SLAM framework that fuses event data with RGB-D inputs to simultaneously reduce motion blur in images and compensate for the sparse and discrete nature of event streams, enabling robust tracking and high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Specifically, our system explicitly models the camera's continuous trajectory during exposure, supporting event- and blur-aware tracking and mapping on a unified 3D Gaussian Splatting scene. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable camera response function to align the dynamic ranges of events and images, along with a no-event loss to suppress ringing artifacts during reconstruction. We validate our approach on a new dataset comprising synthetic and real-world sequences with significant motion blur. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EGS-SLAM consistently outperforms existing GS-SLAM systems in both trajectory accuracy and photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction.

Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200 degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view (200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200 degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and distortion-heavy image inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, its substantial storage requirements present significant challenges for practical applications. While recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DGS methods increasingly incorporate dedicated compression modules, there is a lack of a comprehensive framework to evaluate their perceptual impact. Therefore we present 3DGS-IEval-15K, the first large-scale image quality assessment (IQA) dataset specifically designed for compressed 3DGS representations. Our dataset encompasses 15,200 images rendered from 10 real-world scenes through 6 representative 3DGS algorithms at 20 strategically selected viewpoints, with different compression levels leading to various distortion effects. Through controlled subjective experiments, we collect human perception data from 60 viewers. We validate dataset quality through scene diversity and MOS distribution analysis, and establish a comprehensive benchmark with 30 representative IQA metrics covering diverse types. As the largest-scale 3DGS quality assessment dataset to date, our work provides a foundation for developing 3DGS specialized IQA metrics, and offers essential data for investigating view-dependent quality distribution patterns unique to 3DGS.

| **[Mixture of Experts Guided by Gaussian Splatters Matters: A new Approach to Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06318v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions), they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle with motion-blurred frames, which are common in real-world scenarios like low-light or long-exposure conditions. This often results in a significant reduction in both camera localization accuracy and map reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we propose a dense visual deblur SLAM pipeline (i.e. MBA-SLAM) to handle severe motion-blurred inputs and enhance image deblurring. Our approach integrates an efficient motion blur-aware tracker with either neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting based mapper. By accurately modeling the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images, our method simultaneously learns 3D scene representation and estimates the cameras' local trajectory during exposure time, enabling proactive compensation for motion blur caused by camera movement. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MBA-SLAM surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both camera localization and map reconstruction, showcasing superior performance across a range of datasets, including synthetic and real datasets featuring sharp images as well as those affected by motion blur, highlighting the versatility and robustness of our approach.

While NeRF extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.</p></details> |  |

Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the 3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes. Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, ACM Multimeida 2025 accepted</p></details> |

Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality.

However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[A 3DGS-Diffusion Self-Supervised Framework for Normal Estimation from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05950v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation. Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and 3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization. This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2 minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer methods.

As point clouds serve as a widely-used and easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes.

However, despite the exponential growth of RF research, RF-related contributions to the XR community remain sparse. To better understand this research gap, we performed a systematic survey of current RF literature to analyze (i) how RF is envisioned for XR applications, (ii) how they have already been implemented, and (iii) the remaining research gaps.

| **[3DGabSplat: 3D Gabor Splatting for Frequency-adaptive Radiance Field Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05343v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore, to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes. Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM'25</p></details> |
| **[CountingFruit: Language-Guided 3D Fruit Counting with Semantic Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01109v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D fruit counting in orchards is challenging due to heavy occlusion, semantic ambiguity between fruits and surrounding structures, and the high computational cost of volumetric reconstruction. Existing pipelines often rely on multi-view 2D segmentation and dense volumetric sampling, which lead to accumulated fusion errors and slow inference. We introduce FruitLangGS, a language-guided 3D fruit counting framework that reconstructs orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive-density Gaussian Splatting pipeline with radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization, enabling scalable 3D representation. During inference, compressed CLIP-aligned semantic vectors embedded in each Gaussian are filtered via a dual-threshold cosine similarity mechanism, retrieving Gaussians relevant to target prompts while suppressing common distractors (e.g., foliage), without requiring retraining or image-space masks. The selected Gaussians are then sampled into dense point clouds and clustered geometrically to estimate fruit instances, remaining robust under severe occlusion and viewpoint variation. Experiments on nine different orchard-scale datasets demonstrate that FruitLangGS consistently outperforms existing pipelines in instance counting recall, avoiding multi-view segmentation fusion errors and achieving up to 99.7% recall on Pfuji-Size_Orch2018 orchard dataset. Ablation studies further confirm that language-conditioned semantic embedding and dual-threshold prompt filtering are essential for suppressing distractors and improving counting accuracy under heavy occlusion. Beyond fruit counting, the same framework enables prompt-driven 3D semantic retrieval without retraining, highlighting the potential of language-guided 3D perception for scalable agricultural scene understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refining Gaussian Splatting: A Volumetric Densification Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05187v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching (DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses 3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[UGOD: Uncertainty-Guided Differentiable Opacity and Soft Dropout for Enhanced Sparse-View 3DGS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04968v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering. Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Laplacian Analysis Meets Dynamics Modelling: Gaussian Splatting for 4D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04966v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic 3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions. Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity.</p></details> |  |

Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning, and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated video samples are available at our website: https://eyeline-labs.github.io/CineScale/.</p></details> | <details><summary>CineS...</summary><p>CineScale is an extended work of FreeScale (ICCV 2025).

| **[Visual Autoregressive Modeling for Instruction-Guided Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15772v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer. VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a $512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at https://github.com/HiDream-ai/VAREdit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source codes and models are available at https://github.com/HiDream-ai/VAREdit</p></details> |
| **[Probability Density from Latent Diffusion Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15737v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work. However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.</p></details> | ECAI 2025 |

However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution, and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands. This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500 complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot. We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[When and What: Diffusion-Grounded VideoLLM with Entity Aware Segmentation for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15641v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity, and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast-DDPM: Fast Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Medical Image-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14802v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved unprecedented success in computer vision. However, they remain underutilized in medical imaging, a field crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. This is primarily due to the high computational cost associated with (1) the use of large number of time steps (e.g., 1,000) in diffusion processes and (2) the increased dimensionality of medical images, which are often 3D or 4D. Training a diffusion model on medical images typically takes days to weeks, while sampling each image volume takes minutes to hours. To address this challenge, we introduce Fast-DDPM, a simple yet effective approach capable of improving training speed, sampling speed, and generation quality simultaneously. Unlike DDPM, which trains the image denoiser across 1,000 time steps, Fast-DDPM trains and samples using only 10 time steps. The key to our method lies in aligning the training and sampling procedures to optimize time-step utilization. Specifically, we introduced two efficient noise schedulers with 10 time steps: one with uniform time step sampling and another with non-uniform sampling. We evaluated Fast-DDPM across three medical image-to-image generation tasks: multi-image super-resolution, image denoising, and image-to-image translation. Fast-DDPM outperformed DDPM and current state-of-the-art methods based on convolutional networks and generative adversarial networks in all tasks. Additionally, Fast-DDPM reduced the training time to 0.2x and the sampling time to 0.01x compared to DDPM. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/Fast-DDPM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vulnerabilities in AI-generated Image Detection: The Challenge of Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20836v4)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image synthesis, particularly with the advent of GAN and Diffusion models, have amplified public concerns regarding the dissemination of disinformation. To address such concerns, numerous AI-generated Image (AIGI) Detectors have been proposed and achieved promising performance in identifying fake images. However, there still lacks a systematic understanding of the adversarial robustness of AIGI detectors. In this paper, we examine the vulnerability of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors against adversarial attack under white-box and black-box settings, which has been rarely investigated so far. To this end, we propose a new method to attack AIGI detectors. First, inspired by the obvious difference between real images and fake images in the frequency domain, we add perturbations under the frequency domain to push the image away from its original frequency distribution. Second, we explore the full posterior distribution of the surrogate model to further narrow this gap between heterogeneous AIGI detectors, e.g. transferring adversarial examples across CNNs and ViTs. This is achieved by introducing a novel post-train Bayesian strategy that turns a single surrogate into a Bayesian one, capable of simulating diverse victim models using one pre-trained surrogate, without the need for re-training. We name our method as Frequency-based Post-train Bayesian Attack, or FPBA. Through FPBA, we show that adversarial attack is truly a real threat to AIGI detectors, because FPBA can deliver successful black-box attacks across models, generators, defense methods, and even evade cross-generator detection, which is a crucial real-world detection scenario. The code will be shared upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mean-Field Langevin Diffusions with Density-dependent Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20958v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of non-convex optimization, we let the temperature of a Langevin diffusion to depend on the diffusion's own density function. The rationale is that the induced density captures to some extent the landscape imposed by the non-convex function to be minimized, such that a density-dependent temperature provides location-wise random perturbation that may better react to, for instance, the location and depth of local minimizers. As the Langevin dynamics is now self-regulated by its own density, it forms a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Nemytskii type, distinct from the standard McKean-Vlasov equations. Relying on Wasserstein subdifferential calculus, we first show that the corresponding (nonlinear) Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution. Next, a weak solution to the SDE is constructed from the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, by Trevisan's superposition principle. As time goes to infinity, we further show that the induced density converges to an invariant distribution, which admits an explicit formula in terms of the Lambert $W$ function. A numerical example suggests that the density-dependent temperature can simultaneously improve the accuracy of and rate of convergence to the estimate of global minimizers.</p></details> |  |

Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially, Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReconDreamer-RL: Enhancing Reinforcement Learning via Diffusion-based Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08170v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation, these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA), which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in). Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.</p></details> |  |
| **[FoleySpace: Vision-Aligned Binaural Spatial Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12918v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, with the advancement of AIGC, deep learning-based video-to-audio (V2A) technology has garnered significant attention. However, existing research mostly focuses on mono audio generation that lacks spatial perception, while the exploration of binaural spatial audio generation technologies, which can provide a stronger sense of immersion, remains insufficient. To solve this problem, we propose FoleySpace, a framework for video-to-binaural audio generation that produces immersive and spatially consistent stereo sound guided by visual information. Specifically, we develop a sound source estimation method to determine the sound source 2D coordinates and depth in each video frame, and then employ a coordinate mapping mechanism to convert the 2D source positions into a 3D trajectory. This 3D trajectory, together with the monaural audio generated by a pre-trained V2A model, serves as a conditioning input for a diffusion model to generate spatially consistent binaural audio. To support the generation of dynamic sound fields, we constructed a training dataset based on recorded Head-Related Impulse Responses that includes various sound source movement scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in spatial perception consistency, effectively enhancing the immersive quality of the audio-visual experience.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, several unsupervised learning approaches using (deep) neural networks have been developed to solve PDE parameter identifications. These approaches employ neural networks as ansatz functions to approximate the parameters and / or the states, and have demonstrated impressive empirical performance. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on these unsupervised learning techniques on one model problem, diffusion coefficient identification, from the classical numerical analysis perspective, and outline a general framework for deriving rigorous error bounds on the discrete approximations obtained using the Galerkin finite element method, hybrid method and deep neural networks. Throughout we highlight the crucial role of conditional stability estimates in the error analysis.</p></details> | 49 pages |

Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it, we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors have withdrawn this manuscript because the current version requires substantial revisions and is no longer suitable for posting</p></details> |

To enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling, suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized models.</p></details> |  |

However, some challenging OOD samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space, can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced, boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score, effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly surpasses existing methods, and the code is available at https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> |
| **[Inverse Problem Sampling in Latent Space Using Sequential Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05908v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In image processing, solving inverse problems is the task of finding plausible reconstructions of an image that was corrupted by some (usually known) degradation operator. Commonly, this process is done using a generative image model that can guide the reconstruction towards solutions that appear natural. The success of diffusion models over the last few years has made them a leading candidate for this task. However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We name our method LD-SMC. We define a generative model for the data using additional auxiliary observations and perform posterior inference with SMC sampling based on a reverse diffusion process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of LD-SMC over competing methods in various inverse problem tasks and especially in challenging inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TextSplat: Text-Guided Semantic Fusion for Generalizable Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09588v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Generalizable Gaussian Splatting have enabled robust 3D reconstruction from sparse input views by utilizing feed-forward Gaussian Splatting models, achieving superior cross-scene generalization. However, while many methods focus on geometric consistency, they often neglect the potential of text-driven guidance to enhance semantic understanding, which is crucial for accurately reconstructing fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose TextSplat--the first text-driven Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework. By employing a text-guided fusion of diverse semantic cues, our framework learns robust cross-modal feature representations that improve the alignment of geometric and semantic information, producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Specifically, our framework employs three parallel modules to obtain complementary representations: the Diffusion Prior Depth Estimator for accurate depth information, the Semantic Aware Segmentation Network for detailed semantic information, and the Multi-View Interaction Network for refined cross-view features. Then, in the Text-Guided Semantic Fusion Module, these representations are integrated via the text-guided and attention-based feature aggregation mechanism, resulting in enhanced 3D Gaussian parameters enriched with detailed semantic cues. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Interpolation Learning Using Diffusion Models for Cardiac Volume Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13826v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a critical tool for diagnosing and managing cardiovascular disease, yet its utility is often limited by the sparse acquisition of 2D short-axis slices, resulting in incomplete volumetric information. Accurate 3D reconstruction from these sparse slices is essential for comprehensive cardiac assessment, but existing methods face challenges, including reliance on predefined interpolation schemes (e.g., linear or spherical), computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic inputs such as segmentation labels or motion data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Cardiac Latent Interpolation Diffusion (CaLID) framework that introduces three key innovations. First, we present a data-driven interpolation scheme based on diffusion models, which can capture complex, non-linear relationships between sparse slices and improves reconstruction accuracy. Second, we design a computationally efficient method that operates in the latent space and speeds up 3D whole-heart upsampling time by a factor of 24, reducing computational overhead compared to previous methods. Third, with only sparse 2D CMR images as input, our method achieves SOTA performance against baseline methods, eliminating the need for auxiliary input such as morphological guidance, thus simplifying workflows. We further extend our method to 2D+T data, enabling the effective modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring temporal coherence.

These models are often trained on numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process: Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on average across four tasks compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)</p></details> |

However, the absence of explicit cascade or infection probability data makes it particularly challenging to infer influence in hypergraphs. To address this, we introduce HIP, a unified and model-independent framework for influence prediction without knowing the underlying spreading model. HIP fuses multi-dimensional centrality indicators with a temporally reinterpreted distance matrix to effectively represent node-level diffusion capacity in the absence of observable spreading. These representations are further processed through a multi-hop Hypergraph Neural Network (HNN) to capture complex higher-order structural dependencies, while temporal correlations are modeled using a hybrid module that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Notably, HIP is inherently modular: substituting the standard HGNN with the advanced DPHGNN, and the LSTM with xLSTM, yields similarly strong performance, showcasing its architectural generality and robustness. Empirical evaluations across 14 real-world hypergraph datasets demonstrate that HIP consistently surpasses existing baselines in prediction accuracy, resilience, and identification of top influencers, all without relying on any diffusion trajectories or prior knowledge of the spreading model. These findings underline HIP's effectiveness and adaptability as a general-purpose solution for influence prediction in complex hypergraph environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Long-term User Behaviors with Diffusion-driven Multi-interest Network for CTR Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15311v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction, crucial for recommender systems and online advertising, etc., has been confirmed to benefit from modeling long-term user behaviors. Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of noise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness. Recent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models. However, current two-stage models often filter out significant information, resulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the complete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and generative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest Network) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user interest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest extraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain interest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between interest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user interests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and interest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented interest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with the latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted interest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the generated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive offline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN. Moreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B testing. Our source code is available at https://github.com/laiweijiang/DiffuMIN.</p></details> |  |

This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, project page: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/OmniVideo_project/</p></details> |

However, current benchmarks and models inherit biases present in mass-spectrometry and binding-assay datasets, limiting discovery of novel peptide ligands. To address this issue, we introduce a structure-guided benchmark of pMHC-I peptides designed using diffusion models conditioned on crystal structure interaction distances. Spanning twenty high-priority HLA alleles, this benchmark is independent of previously characterized peptides yet reproduces canonical anchor residue preferences, indicating structural generalization without experimental dataset bias. Using this resource, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art sequence-based predictors perform poorly at recognizing the binding potential of these structurally stable designs, indicating allele-specific limitations invisible in conventional evaluations. Our geometry-aware design pipeline yields peptides with high predicted structural integrity and higher residue diversity than existing datasets, representing a key resource for unbiased model training and evaluation.

| **[CopyrightShield: Enhancing Diffusion Model Security against Copyright Infringement Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01528v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have attracted significant attention due to its exceptional data generation capabilities in fields such as image synthesis. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to copyright infringement attacks, where attackers inject strategically modified non-infringing images into the training set, inducing the model to generate infringing content under the prompt of specific poisoned captions. To address this issue, we first propose a defense framework, CopyrightShield, to defend against the above attack. Specifically, we analyze the memorization mechanism of diffusion models and find that attacks exploit the model's overfitting to specific spatial positions and prompts, causing it to reproduce poisoned samples under backdoor triggers. Based on this, we propose a poisoned sample detection method using spatial masking and data attribution to quantify poisoning risk and accurately identify hidden backdoor samples. To further mitigate memorization of poisoned features, we introduce an adaptive optimization strategy that integrates a dynamic penalty term into the training loss, reducing reliance on infringing features while preserving generative performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CopyrightShield significantly improves poisoned sample detection performance across two attack scenarios, achieving average F1-scores of 0.665, retarding the First-Attack Epoch (FAE) of 115.2% and decreasing the Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) by 56.7%. Compared to the SoTA backdoor defense in diffusion models, the defense effect is improved by about 25%, showcasing its superiority and practicality in enhancing the security of diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

The release of several public datasets has significantly advanced research in this area, yet many existing methods struggle with data imbalance issues. To address this challenge, this study introduces a data augmentation method, called NucleiMix, which is designed to balance the distribution of nuclei types by increasing the number of rare-type nuclei within datasets. NucleiMix operates in two phases. In the first phase, it identifies candidate locations similar to the surroundings of rare-type nuclei and inserts rare-type nuclei into the candidate locations. In the second phase, it employs a progressive inpainting strategy using a pre-trained diffusion model to seamlessly integrate rare-type nuclei into their new environments in replacement of major-type nuclei or background locations. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of NucleiMix on three public datasets using two popular nuclei instance segmentation models. The results demonstrate the superior ability of NucleiMix to synthesize realistic rare-type nuclei and to enhance the quality of nuclei segmentation and classification in an accurate and robust manner.</p></details> |  |

While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process, facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

| **[Pretrained Diffusion Models Are Inherently Skipped-Step Samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15233v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods, such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective. However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially, we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models, including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Multi-Modal Coding for High-Quality 3D Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15228v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds). Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIFFA: Large Language Diffusion Models Can Listen and Understand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18452v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across textual and multimodal domains. In parallel, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm, offering improved controllability, bidirectional context modeling, and robust generation. However, their application to the audio modality remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{DIFFA}, the first diffusion-based large audio-language model designed to perform spoken language understanding. DIFFA integrates a frozen diffusion language model with a lightweight dual-adapter architecture that bridges speech understanding and natural language reasoning. We employ a two-stage training pipeline: first, aligning semantic representations via an ASR objective; then, learning instruction-following abilities through synthetic audio-caption pairs automatically generated by prompting LLMs. Despite being trained on only 960 hours of ASR and 127 hours of synthetic instruction data, DIFFA demonstrates competitive performance on major benchmarks, including MMSU, MMAU, and VoiceBench, outperforming several autoregressive open-source baselines. Our results reveal the potential of diffusion-based language models for efficient and scalable audio understanding, opening a new direction for speech-driven AI. Our code will be available at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/DIFFA.git.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion models excel at photorealism but struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows) without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools.

| **[Versatile Cardiovascular Signal Generation with a Unified Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22306v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG), electrocardiography (ECG), and blood pressure (BP) are inherently correlated and complementary, together reflecting the health of cardiovascular system. However, their joint utilization in real-time monitoring is severely limited by diverse acquisition challenges from noisy wearable recordings to burdened invasive procedures. Here we propose UniCardio, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that reconstructs low-quality signals and synthesizes unrecorded signals in a unified generative framework. Its key innovations include a specialized model architecture to manage the signal modalities involved in generation tasks and a continual learning paradigm to incorporate varying modality combinations. By exploiting the complementary nature of cardiovascular signals, UniCardio clearly outperforms recent task-specific baselines in signal denoising, imputation, and translation. The generated signals match the performance of ground-truth signals in detecting abnormal health conditions and estimating vital signs, even in unseen domains, while ensuring interpretability for human experts. These advantages position UniCardio as a promising avenue for advancing AI-assisted healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[MeSS: City Mesh-Guided Outdoor Scene Generation with Cross-View Consistent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15169v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however, the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS (Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure) using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these, we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.</p></details> |  |

It is widely used for clinical assessment of disease and injury, and for neuroscience research. Analyzing the dMRI data to extract useful information for medical and scientific purposes can be challenging. The dMRI measurements may suffer from strong noise and artifacts, and may exhibit high inter-session and inter-scanner variability in the data, as well as inter-subject heterogeneity in brain structure. Moreover, the relationship between measurements and the phenomena of interest can be highly complex. Recent years have witnessed increasing use of machine learning methods for dMRI analysis. This manuscript aims to assess these efforts, with a focus on methods that have addressed data preprocessing and harmonization, microstructure mapping, tractography, and white matter tract analysis. We study the main findings, strengths, and weaknesses of the existing methods and suggest topics for future research. We find that machine learning may be exceptionally suited to tackle some of the difficult tasks in dMRI analysis. However, for this to happen, several shortcomings of existing methods and critical unresolved issues need to be addressed. There is a pressing need to improve evaluation practices, to increase the availability of rich training datasets and validation benchmarks, as well as model generalizability, reliability, and explainability concerns.</p></details> |  |

The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired ``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts. In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present several side effects of concept erasure. For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes. This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets, and attribute leakage. Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal. We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on robust concept erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017 demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling by averaging: A multiscale approach to score estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15069v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for efficient sampling from complex, unnormalised target distributions by exploiting multiscale dynamics. Traditional score-based sampling methods either rely on learned approximations of the score function or involve computationally expensive nested Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) loops. In contrast, the proposed approach leverages stochastic averaging within a slow-fast system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to estimate intermediate scores along a diffusion path without training or inner-loop MCMC. Two algorithms are developed under this framework: MultALMC, which uses multiscale annealed Langevin dynamics, and MultCDiff, based on multiscale controlled diffusions for the reverse-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Both overdamped and underdamped variants are considered, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the desired diffusion path. The framework is extended to handle heavy-tailed target distributions using Student's t-based noise models and tailored fast-process dynamics. Empirical results across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including multimodal and high-dimensional distributions, demonstrate that the proposed methods are competitive with existing samplers in terms of accuracy and efficiency, without the need for learned models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction (CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation; and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask, harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives. Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a broader bi-level optimization framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 21 tables, 13 figures</p></details> |

Diffusion models, though capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source, TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8% against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCVW-CV4BIOM 2025</p></details> |

However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first three authors.

In this paper, inspired by the Langevin equation, an update law is developed for a Lyapunov-based DNN control method, taking the form of a stochastic differential equation. The drift term is designed to minimize the system's generalized internal energy, while the diffusion term is governed by a user-selected generalized temperature law, allowing for more controlled fluctuations. The minimization of generalized internal energy in this design fulfills the exploitation objective, while the temperature-based stochastic noise ensures sufficient exploration. Using a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed Lyapunov-based Langevin Adaptive Thermodynamic (LyLA-Therm) neural network controller achieves probabilistic convergence of the tracking and parameter estimation errors to an ultimate bound. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with the LyLA-Therm architecture achieving up to 20.66% improvement in tracking errors, up to 20.89% improvement in function approximation errors, and up to 11.31% improvement in off-trajectory function approximation errors compared to the baseline deterministic approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantization Meets dLLMs: A Systematic Study of Post-training Quantization for Diffusion LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14896v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and experimental setups will be released to support the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Work in Progress</p></details> |
| **[Squeezed Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14871v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64, mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis - consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[TransLight: Image-Guided Customized Lighting Control with Generative Decoupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14814v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets, injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal. The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination harmonization and editing.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

| **[Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14748v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities: molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.</p></details> |  |

While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

Meanwhile, diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available. Project page: https://gsfix3d.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual Multiplex Staining for Histological Images using a Marker-wise Conditioned Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14681v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing molecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining cannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large repositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling complex data distributions utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate multiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers. To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches. This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&E and multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale analyses of existing H&E image repositories.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods focus on modifying the generation probabilities conditioned on the texts containing target concepts. However, they fail to guarantee the desired generation of texts unseen in the training phase, especially for the adversarial texts from malicious attacks. In this paper, we analyze the erasure task and point out that existing methods cannot guarantee the minimization of the total probabilities of undesired generation. To tackle this problem, we propose Dark Miner. It entails a recurring three-stage process that comprises mining, verifying, and circumventing. This method greedily mines embeddings with maximum generation probabilities of target concepts and more effectively reduces their generation. In the experiments, we evaluate its performance on the inappropriateness, object, and style concepts. Compared with the previous methods, our method achieves better erasure and defense results, especially under multiple adversarial attacks, while preserving the native generation capability of the models. Our code will be available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffIER: Optimizing Diffusion Models with Iterative Error Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13628v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap. Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks. Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.</p></details> |  |

Our approach enforces structural consistency through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and temporal stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM 2025; Code is released at https://github.com/VISION-SJTU/AnchorSync</p></details> |

This limitation can be mitigated by leveraging suboptimal, open-ended play data, often easier to collect and offering greater diversity. This work builds upon recent advances in generative modeling, specifically Flow Matching, an alternative to Diffusion models. We introduce a method for estimating the minimum or maximum of the learned distribution by leveraging the unique properties of Flow Matching, namely, deterministic transport and support for arbitrary source distributions. We apply this method to develop several goal-conditioned imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms based on Flow Matching, where policies are conditioned on both current and goal observations. We explore and compare different architectural configurations by combining core components, such as critic, planner, actor, or world model, in various ways. We evaluated our agents on the OGBench benchmark and analyzed how different demonstration behaviors during data collection affect performance in a 2D non-prehensile pushing task. Furthermore, we validated our approach on real hardware by deploying it on the Talos humanoid robot to perform complex manipulation tasks based on high-dimensional image observations, featuring a sequence of pick-and-place and articulated object manipulation in a realistic kitchen environment.

| **[Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05662v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success, recent reconstruction-based anomaly detection (AD) methods via diffusion modeling still involve fine-grained noise-strength tuning and computationally expensive multi-step denoising, leading to a fundamental tension between fidelity and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel inversion-based AD approach - detection via noising in latent space - which circumvents explicit reconstruction. Importantly, we contend that the limitations in prior reconstruction-based methods originate from the prevailing detection via denoising in RGB space paradigm. To address this, we model AD under a reconstruction-free formulation, which directly infers the final latent variable corresponding to the input image via DDIM inversion, and then measures the deviation based on the known prior distribution for anomaly scoring. Specifically, in approximating the original probability flow ODE using the Euler method, we only enforce very few inversion steps to noise the clean image to pursue inference efficiency. As the added noise is adaptively derived with the learned diffusion model, the original features for the clean testing image can still be leveraged to yield high detection accuracy. We perform extensive experiments and detailed analysis across three widely used image AD datasets under the unsupervised unified setting to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, regarding state-of-the-art AD performance, and about 2 times inference time speedup without diffusion distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/SkyShunsuke/InversionAD</p></details> |

However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30% of the computational resources and 20% GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.</p></details> |  |

We present a lightweight, interpretable and non-invasive framework for assessing information quality based solely on diffusion dynamics, demonstrated here in the context of academic publications. Using a heterogeneous dataset of 29,264 sciences, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) and social science papers from ArnetMiner and OpenAlex, we model the diffusion network of each paper as a set of three theoretically motivated features: diversity, timeliness, and salience. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) trained on these features achieved Pearson correlations of 0.8468 for next-year citation gain and up to 97.8% accuracy in predicting high-impact papers. Feature relevance studies reveal timeliness and salience as the most robust predictors, while diversity offers less stable benefits in the academic setting but may be more informative in social media contexts. The framework's transparency, domain-agnostic design, and minimal feature requirements position it as a scalable tool for global information quality assessment, opening new avenues for moving beyond binary credibility labels toward richer, diffusion-informed evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |

Despite their success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the error within DDPMs, particularly the non-asymptotic bounds required for the comparison of their efficiency, remain scarce. Making minimal assumptions on the initial data distribution, allowing for example the manifold hypothesis, this paper presents explicit non-asymptotic bounds on the forward diffusion error in total variation (TV), expressed as a function of the terminal time $T$. We parametrise multi-modal data distributions in terms of the distance $R$ to their furthest modes and consider forward diffusions with additive and multiplicative noise. Our analysis rigorously proves that, under mild assumptions, the canonical choice of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process cannot be significantly improved in terms of reducing the terminal time $T$ as a function of $R$ and error tolerance $\varepsilon>0$. Motivated by data distributions arising in generative modelling, we also establish a cut-off like phenomenon (as $R\to\infty$) for the convergence to its invariant measure in TV of an OU process, initialized at a multi-modal distribution with maximal mode distance $R$.</p></details> | <details><summary>new S...</summary><p>new Subsection 4.1 on Kinetic Langevin diffusion as forward process included; to appear in Annals of Applied Probability; 25 pages, 4 figures; see short YouTube videos https://youtu.be/hQvfpwI0UPk?si=tfL-DrH2EzqCuGSN and https://youtu.be/xjzVPOEkl44?si=fq9l3kZFg8eELYG3 explaining the main results and ideas of proofs</p></details> |

CTR models critically depend on a large number of cross-features between the target item and the user to estimate the probability of clicking on the item, and discarding these cross-features will significantly impair model performance. Therefore, to harness the ability of generative models to understand data distributions and thereby alleviate the constraints of traditional discriminative models in label-scarce space, diverging from the item-generation paradigm of sequence generation methods, we propose a novel sample-level generation paradigm specifically designed for the CTR task: a two-stage Discrete Diffusion-Based Generative CTR training framework (DGenCTR). This two-stage framework comprises a diffusion-based generative pre-training stage and a CTR-targeted supervised fine-tuning stage for CTR. Finally, extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing conclusively validate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

As video length increases, issues such as visual degradation, loss of identity consistency, temporal incoherence, and error accumulation become increasingly prominent, severely impacting the realism and reliability of generated results. To address these issues, we present LetsTalk, a diffusion transformer framework that incorporates multimodal guidance and a novel memory bank mechanism, explicitly maintaining contextual continuity and enabling robust, high-quality, and efficient long-duration talking video generation. Specifically, LetsTalk introduces a memory bank combined with a noise-regularized training strategy to mitigate error accumulation and sampling artifacts during long video generation. To further enhance efficiency and spatiotemporal consistency, LetsTalk employs a deep compression autoencoder and a spatiotemporal-aware transformer with linear attention for effective multimodal fusion. Furthermore, we systematically analyze three multimodal fusion schemes, adopting deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait features to ensure visual consistency, and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio to synchronize animation with speech while preserving motion diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LetsTalk achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic talking videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, while maintaining remarkable efficiency with 8 fewer parameters than previous approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-stage watermarking framework for diffusion models, designed to establish copyright and trace generated images back to their source. Our multi-stage watermarking technique involves embedding: (i) a fixed watermark that is localized in the diffusion model's learned noise distribution and, (ii) a human-imperceptible, dynamic watermark in generates images, leveraging a fine-tuned decoder. By leveraging the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and cosine similarity, we adapt the watermark's shape and color to the generated content while maintaining robustness. We demonstrate that our method enables reliable source verification through watermark classification, even when the dynamic watermark is adjusted for content-specific variations. Source model verification is enabled through watermark classification. o support further research, we generate a dataset of watermarked images and introduce a methodology to evaluate the statistical impact of watermarking on generated content.Additionally, we rigorously test our framework against various attack scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and minimal impact on image quality. Our work advances the field of AI-generated content security by providing a scalable solution for model ownership verification and misuse prevention.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge, we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness, and temporal consistency.

| **[MinD: Learning A Dual-System World Model for Real-Time Planning and Implicit Risk Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18897v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Generation Models (VGMs) have become powerful backbones for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging large-scale pretraining for robust dynamics modeling. However, current methods underutilize their distribution modeling capabilities for predicting future states. Two challenges hinder progress: integrating generative processes into feature learning is both technically and conceptually underdeveloped, and naive frame-by-frame video diffusion is computationally inefficient for real-time robotics. To address these, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a dual-system world model for real-time, risk-aware planning. MinD uses two asynchronous diffusion processes: a low-frequency visual generator (LoDiff) that predicts future scenes and a high-frequency diffusion policy (HiDiff) that outputs actions. Our key insight is that robotic policies do not require fully denoised frames but can rely on low-resolution latents generated in a single denoising step. To connect early predictions to actions, we introduce DiffMatcher, a video-action alignment module with a novel co-training strategy that synchronizes the two diffusion models. MinD achieves a 63% success rate on RL-Bench, 60% on real-world Franka tasks, and operates at 11.3 FPS, demonstrating the efficiency of single-step latent features for control signals. Furthermore, MinD identifies 74% of potential task failures in advance, providing real-time safety signals for monitoring and intervention. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient and reliable robotic manipulation using generative world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marrying Autoregressive Transformer and Diffusion with Multi-Reference Autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09482v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SketchDNN: Joint Continuous-Discrete Diffusion for CAD Sketch Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11579v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation, facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches. Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL) from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 63 figures, Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML2025)</p></details> |
| **[Ouroboros: Single-step Diffusion Models for Cycle-consistent Forward and Inverse Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14461v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently, leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods. We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
