| **[FreeZe: Training-free zero-shot 6D pose estimation with geometric and vision foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00947v3)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of objects unseen during training is highly desirable yet challenging. Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve ambiguous cases due to geometrically symmetric objects that is based on visual features. We comprehensively evaluate FreeZe across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, which include over a hundred 3D objects and 20,000 images captured in various scenarios. FreeZe consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches, including competitors extensively trained on synthetic 6D pose estimation data.

| **[A Novel Convolution and Attention Mechanism-based Model for 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01993v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating 6D object poses from RGB images is challenging because the lack of depth information requires inferring a three dimensional structure from 2D projections. Traditional methods often rely on deep learning with grid based data structures but struggle to capture complex dependencies among extracted features. To overcome this, we introduce a graph based representation derived directly from images, where spatial temporal features of each pixel serve as nodes, and relationships between them are defined through node connectivity and spatial interactions. We also employ feature selection mechanisms that use spatial attention and self attention distillation, along with a Legendre convolution layer leveraging the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials for numerical stability. Experiments on the LINEMOD, Occluded LINEMOD, and YCB Video datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms nine existing approaches and achieves state of the art benchmark in object pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[ReFlow6D: Refraction-Guided Transparent Object 6D Pose Estimation via Intermediate Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20830v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transparent objects are ubiquitous in daily life, making their perception and robotics manipulation important. However, they present a major challenge due to their distinct refractive and reflective properties when it comes to accurately estimating the 6D pose. To solve this, we present ReFlow6D, a novel method for transparent object 6D pose estimation that harnesses the refractive-intermediate representation. Unlike conventional approaches, our method leverages a feature space impervious to changes in RGB image space and independent of depth information. Drawing inspiration from image matting, we model the deformation of the light path through transparent objects, yielding a unique object-specific intermediate representation guided by light refraction that is independent of the environment in which objects are observed. By integrating these intermediate features into the pose estimation network, we show that ReFlow6D achieves precise 6D pose estimation of transparent objects, using only RGB images as input. Our method further introduces a novel transparent object compositing loss, fostering the generation of superior refractive-intermediate features. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TOD and Trans32K-6D datasets. Robot grasping experiments further demonstrate that ReFlow6D's pose estimation accuracy effectively translates to real-world robotics task.

| **[Level-Set Parameters: Novel Representation for 3D Shape Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13502v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D shape analysis has been largely focused on traditional 3D representations of point clouds and meshes, but the discrete nature of these data makes the analysis susceptible to variations in input resolutions. Recent development of neural fields brings in level-set parameters from signed distance functions as a novel, continuous, and numerical representation of 3D shapes, where the shape surfaces are defined as zero-level-sets of those functions. This motivates us to extend shape analysis from the traditional 3D data to these novel parameter data. Since the level-set parameters are not Euclidean like point clouds, we establish correlations across different shapes by formulating them as a pseudo-normal distribution, and learn the distribution prior from the respective dataset. To further explore the level-set parameters with shape transformations, we propose to condition a subset of these parameters on rotations and translations, and generate them with a hypernetwork. This simplifies the pose-related shape analysis compared to using traditional data. We demonstrate the promise of the novel representations through applications in shape classification (arbitrary poses), retrieval, and 6D object pose estimation.

| **[KITchen: A Real-World Benchmark and Dataset for 6D Object Pose Estimation in Kitchen Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16238v3)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent progress on 6D object pose estimation methods for robotic grasping, a substantial performance gap persists between the capabilities of these methods on existing datasets and their efficacy in real-world grasping and mobile manipulation tasks, particularly when robots rely solely on their monocular egocentric field of view (FOV). Existing real-world datasets primarily focus on table-top grasping scenarios, where a robot arm is placed in a fixed position and the objects are centralized within the FOV of fixed external camera(s). Assessing performance on such datasets may not accurately reflect the challenges encountered in everyday grasping and mobile manipulation tasks within kitchen environments such as retrieving objects from higher shelves, sinks, dishwashers, ovens, refrigerators, or microwaves. To address this gap, we present KITchen, a novel benchmark designed specifically for estimating the 6D poses of objects located in diverse positions within kitchen settings. For this purpose, we recorded a comprehensive dataset comprising around 205k real-world RGBD images for 111 kitchen objects captured in two distinct kitchens, utilizing a humanoid robot with its egocentric perspectives. Subsequently, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline, to streamline the labeling process of such datasets, resulting in the generation of 2D object labels, 2D object segmentation masks, and 6D object poses with minimal human effort. The benchmark, the dataset, and the annotation pipeline will be publicly available at https://kitchen-dataset.github.io/KITchen.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publishing at The 2024 IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots</p></details> |
| **[COBRA -- COnfidence score Based on shape Regression Analysis for method-independent quality assessment of object pose estimation from single images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16471v6)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a generic procedure for assessing 6D object pose estimates. Our approach relies on the evaluation of discrepancies in the geometry of the observed object, in particular its respective estimated back-projection in 3D, against a putative functional shape representation comprising mixtures of Gaussian Processes, that act as a template. Each Gaussian Process is trained to yield a fragment of the object's surface in a radial fashion with respect to designated reference points. We further define a pose confidence measure as the average probability of pixel back-projections in the Gaussian mixture. The goal of our experiments is two-fold. a) We demonstrate that our functional representation is sufficiently accurate as a shape template on which the probability of back-projected object points can be evaluated, and, b) we show that the resulting confidence scores based on these probabilities are indeed a consistent quality measure of pose.</p></details> |  |
| **[Category Level 6D Object Pose Estimation from a Single RGB Image using Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11420v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose and 3D size of an object from an image is a fundamental task in computer vision. Most current approaches are restricted to specific instances with known models or require ground truth depth information or point cloud captures from LIDAR. We tackle the harder problem of pose estimation for category-level objects from a single RGB image. We propose a novel solution that eliminates the need for specific object models or depth information. Our method utilises score-based diffusion models to generate object pose hypotheses to model the distribution of possible poses for the object. Unlike previous methods that rely on costly trained likelihood estimators to remove outliers before pose aggregation using mean pooling, we introduce a simpler approach using Mean Shift to estimate the mode of the distribution as the final pose estimate. Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the REAL275 dataset by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Targeted Hard Sample Synthesis Based on Estimated Pose and Occlusion Error for Improved Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04279v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D Object pose estimation is a fundamental component in robotics enabling efficient interaction with the environment. It is particularly challenging in bin-picking applications, where objects may be textureless and in difficult poses, and occlusion between objects of the same type may cause confusion even in well-trained models. We propose a novel method of hard example synthesis that is model-agnostic, using existing simulators and the modeling of pose error in both the camera-to-object viewsphere and occlusion space. Through evaluation of the model performance with respect to the distribution of object poses and occlusions, we discover regions of high error and generate realistic training samples to specifically target these regions. With our training approach, we demonstrate an improvement in correct detection rate of up to 20% across several ROBI-dataset objects using state-of-the-art pose estimation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[6DOPE-GS: Online 6D Object Pose Estimation using Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01543v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and accurate object pose estimation is an essential component for modern vision systems in many applications such as Augmented Reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Particle-based 6D Object Pose Estimation from Point Clouds using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00835v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation from a single view remains a challenging problem. In particular, partial observability, occlusions, and object symmetries eventually result in pose ambiguity. To account for this multimodality, this work proposes training a diffusion-based generative model for 6D object pose estimation. During inference, the trained generative model allows for sampling multiple particles, i.e., pose hypotheses. To distill this information into a single pose estimate, we propose two novel and effective pose selection strategies that do not require any additional training or computationally intensive operations. Moreover, while many existing methods for pose estimation primarily focus on the image domain and only incorporate depth information for final pose refinement, our model solely operates on point cloud data. The model thereby leverages recent advancements in point cloud processing and operates upon an SE(3)-equivariant latent space that forms the basis for the particle selection strategies and allows for improved inference times. Our thorough experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach on the Linemod dataset and showcase the effectiveness of our design choices.

| **[GMFlow: Global Motion-Guided Recurrent Flow for 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17174v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation is crucial for robotic perception and precise manipulation. Occlusion and incomplete object visibility are common challenges in this task, but existing pose refinement methods often struggle to handle these issues effectively. To tackle this problem, we propose a global motion-guided recurrent flow estimation method called GMFlow for pose estimation. GMFlow overcomes local ambiguities caused by occlusion or missing parts by seeking global explanations. We leverage the object's structural information to extend the motion of visible parts of the rigid body to its invisible regions. Specifically, we capture global contextual information through a linear attention mechanism and guide local motion information to generate global motion estimates. Furthermore, we introduce object shape constraints in the flow iteration process, making flow estimation suitable for pose estimation scenarios. Experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in accuracy while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GS2Pose: Two-stage 6D Object Pose Estimation Guided by Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03807v3)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a new method for accurate and robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects, named GS2Pose. By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose can utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD model, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input. Specifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse estimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight U-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is designed. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images. GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly competitive results. The code for GS2Pose will soon be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Quantization-Aware Training for 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06753v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge applications, such as collaborative robotics and spacecraft rendezvous, demand efficient 6D object pose estimation on resource-constrained embedded platforms. Existing 6D pose estimation networks are often too large for such deployments, necessitating compression while maintaining reliable performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Modular Quantization-Aware Training (MQAT), an adaptive and mixed-precision quantization-aware training strategy that exploits the modular structure of modern 6D pose estimation architectures. MQAT guides a systematic gradated modular quantization sequence and determines module-specific bit precisions, leading to quantized models that outperform those produced by state-of-the-art uniform and mixed-precision quantization techniques. Our experiments showcase the generality of MQAT across datasets, architectures, and quantization algorithms. Remarkably, MQAT-trained quantized models achieve a significant accuracy boost (>7%) over the baseline full-precision network while reducing model size by a factor of 4x or more.

| **[Omni6D: Large-Vocabulary 3D Object Dataset for Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18261v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation aims at determining an object's translation, rotation, and scale, typically from a single RGBD image. Recent advancements have expanded this estimation from instance-level to category-level, allowing models to generalize across unseen instances within the same category. However, this generalization is limited by the narrow range of categories covered by existing datasets, such as NOCS, which also tend to overlook common real-world challenges like occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Omni6D, a comprehensive RGBD dataset featuring a wide range of categories and varied backgrounds, elevating the task to a more realistic context. 1) The dataset comprises an extensive spectrum of 166 categories, 4688 instances adjusted to the canonical pose, and over 0.8 million captures, significantly broadening the scope for evaluation. 2) We introduce a symmetry-aware metric and conduct systematic benchmarks of existing algorithms on Omni6D, offering a thorough exploration of new challenges and insights. 3) Additionally, we propose an effective fine-tuning approach that adapts models from previous datasets to our extensive vocabulary setting. We believe this initiative will pave the way for new insights and substantial progress in both the industrial and academic fields, pushing forward the boundaries of general 6D pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 (poster).

| **[ZeroPose: CAD-Prompted Zero-shot Object 6D Pose Estimation in Cluttered Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17934v3)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robotics and industry applications have a high demand for the capability to estimate the 6D pose of novel objects from the cluttered scene. However, existing classic pose estimation methods are object-specific, which can only handle the specific objects seen during training. When applied to a novel object, these methods necessitate a cumbersome onboarding process, which involves extensive dataset preparation and model retraining. The extensive duration and resource consumption of onboarding limit their practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce ZeroPose, a novel zero-shot framework that performs pose estimation following a Discovery-Orientation-Registration (DOR) inference pipeline. This framework generalizes to novel objects without requiring model retraining. Given the CAD model of a novel object, ZeroPose enables in seconds onboarding time to extract visual and geometric embeddings from the CAD model as a prompt. With the prompting of the above embeddings, DOR can discover all related instances and estimate their 6D poses without additional human interaction or presupposing scene conditions. Compared with existing zero-shot methods solved by the render-and-compare paradigm, the DOR pipeline formulates the object pose estimation into a feature-matching problem, which avoids time-consuming online rendering and improves efficiency. Experimental results on the seven datasets show that ZeroPose as a zero-shot method achieves comparable performance with object-specific training methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot method with 50x inference speed improvement.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a technical description of the European Space Agency's (ESA) project "AI for AR in Satellite AIT," which combines real-time computer vision and AR systems to assist technicians during satellite assembly. Leveraging Microsoft HoloLens 2 as the AR interface, the system delivers context-aware instructions and real-time feedback, tackling the complexities of object recognition and 6D pose estimation in AIT workflows. All AI models demonstrated over 70% accuracy, with the detection model exceeding 95% accuracy, indicating a high level of performance and reliability. A key contribution of this work lies in the effective use of synthetic data for training AI models in AR applications, addressing the significant challenges of obtaining real-world datasets in highly dynamic satellite environments, as well as the creation of the Segmented Anything Model for Automatic Labelling (SAMAL), which facilitates the automatic annotation of real data, achieving speeds up to 20 times faster than manual human annotation. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of AI-driven AR systems in automating critical satellite assembly tasks, setting a foundation for future innovations in the space industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAST GDRNPP: Improving the Speed of State-of-the-Art 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12720v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation involves determining the three-dimensional translation and rotation of an object within a scene and relative to a chosen coordinate system. This problem is of particular interest for many practical applications in industrial tasks such as quality control, bin picking, and robotic manipulation, where both speed and accuracy are critical for real-world deployment. Current models, both classical and deep-learning-based, often struggle with the trade-off between accuracy and latency. Our research focuses on enhancing the speed of a prominent state-of-the-art deep learning model, GDRNPP, while keeping its high accuracy. We employ several techniques to reduce the model size and improve inference time. These techniques include using smaller and quicker backbones, pruning unnecessary parameters, and distillation to transfer knowledge from a large, high-performing model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed configuration maintains accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art while significantly improving inference time. This advancement could lead to more efficient and practical applications in various industrial scenarios, thereby enhancing the overall applicability of 6D Object Pose Estimation models in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Probabilistic Geometry-Guided Regression for 6DoF Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11819v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation is the problem of identifying the position and orientation of an object relative to a chosen coordinate system, which is a core technology for modern XR applications. State-of-the-art 6D object pose estimators directly predict an object pose given an object observation. Due to the ill-posed nature of the pose estimation problem, where multiple different poses can correspond to a single observation, generating additional plausible estimates per observation can be valuable. To address this, we reformulate the state-of-the-art algorithm GDRNPP and introduce EPRO-GDR (End-to-End Probabilistic Geometry-Guided Regression). Instead of predicting a single pose per detection, we estimate a probability density distribution of the pose. Using the evaluation procedure defined by the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) Challenge, we test our approach on four of its core datasets and demonstrate superior quantitative results for EPRO-GDR on LM-O, YCB-V, and ITODD. Our probabilistic solution shows that predicting a pose distribution instead of a single pose can improve state-of-the-art single-view pose estimation while providing the additional benefit of being able to sample multiple meaningful pose candidates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending 6D Object Pose Estimators for Stereo Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05610v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of objects accurately, quickly, and robustly remains a difficult task. However, recent methods for directly regressing poses from RGB images using dense features have achieved state-of-the-art results. Stereo vision, which provides an additional perspective on the object, can help reduce pose ambiguity and occlusion. Moreover, stereo can directly infer the distance of an object, while mono-vision requires internalized knowledge of the object's size. To extend the state-of-the-art in 6D object pose estimation to stereo, we created a BOP compatible stereo version of the YCB-V dataset. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation algorithms by utilizing stereo vision and can easily be adopted for other dense feature-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>4th I...</summary><p>4th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (ICPRAI)</p></details> |
| **[RGBManip: Monocular Image-based Robotic Manipulation through Active Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03478v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation requires accurate perception of the environment, which poses a significant challenge due to its inherent complexity and constantly changing nature. In this context, RGB image and point-cloud observations are two commonly used modalities in visual-based robotic manipulation, but each of these modalities have their own limitations. Commercial point-cloud observations often suffer from issues like sparse sampling and noisy output due to the limits of the emission-reception imaging principle. On the other hand, RGB images, while rich in texture information, lack essential depth and 3D information crucial for robotic manipulation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an image-only robotic manipulation framework that leverages an eye-on-hand monocular camera installed on the robot's parallel gripper. By moving with the robot gripper, this camera gains the ability to actively perceive object from multiple perspectives during the manipulation process. This enables the estimation of 6D object poses, which can be utilized for manipulation. While, obtaining images from more and diverse viewpoints typically improves pose estimation, it also increases the manipulation time. To address this trade-off, we employ a reinforcement learning policy to synchronize the manipulation strategy with active perception, achieving a balance between 6D pose accuracy and manipulation efficiency. Our experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments showcase the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our approach. %, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve robust real-world robotic manipulation through active pose estimation. We believe that our method will inspire further research on real-world-oriented robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

| **[From Words to Poses: Enhancing Novel Object Pose Estimation with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05413v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots are increasingly envisioned to interact in real-world scenarios, where they must continuously adapt to new situations. To detect and grasp novel objects, zero-shot pose estimators determine poses without prior knowledge. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have shown considerable advances in robotics applications by establishing an understanding between language input and image input. In our work, we take advantage of VLMs zero-shot capabilities and translate this ability to 6D object pose estimation. We propose a novel framework for promptable zero-shot 6D object pose estimation using language embeddings. The idea is to derive a coarse location of an object based on the relevancy map of a language-embedded NeRF reconstruction and to compute the pose estimate with a point cloud registration method. Additionally, we provide an analysis of LERF's suitability for open-set object pose estimation. We examine hyperparameters, such as activation thresholds for relevancy maps and investigate the zero-shot capabilities on an instance- and category-level. Furthermore, we plan to conduct robotic grasping experiments in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Gaussian for Monocular 6D Pose Estimation from Sparse Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02581v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular object pose estimation, as a pivotal task in computer vision and robotics, heavily depends on accurate 2D-3D correspondences, which often demand costly CAD models that may not be readily available. Object 3D reconstruction methods offer an alternative, among which recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) afford a compelling potential. Yet its performance still suffers and tends to overfit with fewer input views. Embracing this challenge, we introduce SGPose, a novel framework for sparse view object pose estimation using Gaussian-based methods. Given as few as ten views, SGPose generates a geometric-aware representation by starting with a random cuboid initialization, eschewing reliance on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline-derived geometry as required by traditional 3DGS methods. SGPose removes the dependence on CAD models by regressing dense 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model from sparse input and random initialization, while the geometric-consistent depth supervision and online synthetic view warping are key to the success. Experiments on typical benchmarks, especially on the Occlusion LM-O dataset, demonstrate that SGPose outperforms existing methods even under sparse view constraints, under-scoring its potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[GS-Pose: Generalizable Segmentation-based 6D Object Pose Estimation with 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10683v2)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces GS-Pose, a unified framework for localizing and estimating the 6D pose of novel objects. GS-Pose begins with a set of posed RGB images of a previously unseen object and builds three distinct representations stored in a database. At inference, GS-Pose operates sequentially by locating the object in the input image, estimating its initial 6D pose using a retrieval approach, and refining the pose with a render-and-compare method. The key insight is the application of the appropriate object representation at each stage of the process. In particular, for the refinement step, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique that offers high rendering speed and relatively low optimization time. Off-the-shelf toolchains and commodity hardware, such as mobile phones, can be used to capture new objects to be added to the database. Extensive evaluations on the LINEMOD and OnePose-LowTexture datasets demonstrate excellent performance, establishing the new state-of-the-art.

| **[Mesh-based Object Tracking for Dynamic Semantic 3D Scene Graphs via Ray Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04979v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel method for 3D geometric scene graph generation using range sensors and RGB cameras. We initially detect instance-wise keypoints with a YOLOv8s model to compute 6D pose estimates of known objects by solving PnP. We use a ray tracing approach to track a geometric scene graph consisting of mesh models of object instances. In contrast to classical point-to-point matching, this leads to more robust results, especially under occlusions between objects instances. We show that using this hybrid strategy leads to robust self-localization, pre-segmentation of the range sensor data and accurate pose tracking of objects using the same environmental representation. All detected objects are integrated into a semantic scene graph. This scene graph then serves as a front end to a semantic mapping framework to allow spatial reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certifying Robustness of Learning-Based Keypoint Detection and Pose Estimation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00117v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the certification of the local robustness of vision-based two-stage 6D object pose estimation. The two-stage method for object pose estimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural network-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods' robustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on their local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust estimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform the certification of local robustness into neural network verification for classification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output specifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate verification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear operations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of injecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull representation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict semantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we propagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then formulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the setting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each pixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear, classification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both sound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on realistic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to certify the robustness of large-scale, keypoint-based pose estimation given images in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Unlike most existing real-world object-centric datasets which only come with RGB capturing, the direct capture of the depth channel allows better 3D annotations and broader downstream applications. WildRGB-D comprises large-scale category-level RGB-D object videos, which are taken using an iPhone to go around the objects in 360 degrees. It contains around 8500 recorded objects and nearly 20000 RGB-D videos across 46 common object categories. These videos are taken with diverse cluttered backgrounds with three setups to cover as many real-world scenarios as possible: (i) a single object in one video; (ii) multiple objects in one video; and (iii) an object with a static hand in one video. The dataset is annotated with object masks, real-world scale camera poses, and reconstructed aggregated point clouds from RGBD videos. We benchmark four tasks with WildRGB-D including novel view synthesis, camera pose estimation, object 6d pose estimation, and object surface reconstruction. Our experiments show that the large-scale capture of RGB-D objects provides a large potential to advance 3D object learning.

The widely available, inexpensive and high-resolution RGB sensors and CNNs that allow for fast inference based on this modality make monocular approaches especially well suited for robotics applications. We observe that previous surveys on object pose estimation establish the state of the art for varying modalities, single- and multi-view settings, and datasets and metrics that consider a multitude of applications. We argue, however, that those works' broad scope hinders the identification of open challenges that are specific to monocular approaches and the derivation of promising future challenges for their application in robotics. By providing a unified view on recent publications from both robotics and computer vision, we find that occlusion handling, novel pose representations, and formalizing and improving category-level pose estimation are still fundamental challenges that are highly relevant for robotics. Moreover, to further improve robotic performance, large object sets, novel objects, refractive materials, and uncertainty estimates are central, largely unsolved open challenges. In order to address them, ontological reasoning, deformability handling, scene-level reasoning, realistic datasets, and the ecological footprint of algorithms need to be improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Transactions on Robotics: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609560 arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.11827</p></details> |
| **[Shape-biased Texture Agnostic Representations for Improved Textureless and Metallic Object Detection and 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04878v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in machine learning have greatly benefited object detection and 6D pose estimation. However, textureless and metallic objects still pose a significant challenge due to few visual cues and the texture bias of CNNs. To address his issue, we propose a strategy for inducing a shape bias to CNN training. In particular, by randomizing textures applied to object surfaces during data rendering, we create training data without consistent textural cues. This methodology allows for seamless integration into existing data rendering engines, and results in negligible computational overhead for data rendering and network training. Our findings demonstrate that the shape bias we induce via randomized texturing, improves over existing approaches using style transfer. We evaluate with three detectors and two pose estimators. For the most recent object detector and for pose estimation in general, estimation accuracy improves for textureless and metallic objects. Additionally we show that our approach increases the pose estimation accuracy in the presence of image noise and strong illumination changes. Code and datasets are publicly available at github.com/hoenigpeter/randomized_texturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[FoundPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with Foundation Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18809v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FoundPose, a model-based method for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single RGB image. The method can quickly onboard new objects using their 3D models without requiring any object- or task-specific training. In contrast, existing methods typically pre-train on large-scale, task-specific datasets in order to generalize to new objects and to bridge the image-to-model domain gap. We demonstrate that such generalization capabilities can be observed in a recent vision foundation model trained in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, our method estimates the object pose from image-to-model 2D-3D correspondences, which are established by matching patch descriptors from the recent DINOv2 model between the image and pre-rendered object templates. We find that reliable correspondences can be established by kNN matching of patch descriptors from an intermediate DINOv2 layer. Such descriptors carry stronger positional information than descriptors from the last layer, and we show their importance when semantic information is ambiguous due to object symmetries or a lack of texture. To avoid establishing correspondences against all object templates, we develop an efficient template retrieval approach that integrates the patch descriptors into the bag-of-words representation and can promptly propose a handful of similarly looking templates. Additionally, we apply featuremetric alignment to compensate for discrepancies in the 2D-3D correspondences caused by coarse patch sampling. The resulting method noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for refinement-free pose estimation on the standard BOP benchmark with seven diverse datasets and can be seamlessly combined with an existing render-and-compare refinement method to achieve RGB-only state-of-the-art results.

Both factors limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a pipeline that does not require CAD models and allows training a state-of-the-art pose estimator requiring only a small set of real images as input. Our method is based on a NeuS2 object representation, that we learn through a semi-automated procedure based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and object-agnostic segmentation. We exploit the novel-view synthesis ability of NeuS2 and simple cut-and-paste augmentation to automatically generate photorealistic object renderings, which we use to train the correspondence-based SurfEmb pose estimator. We evaluate our method on the LINEMOD-Occlusion dataset, extensively studying the impact of its individual components and showing competitive performance with respect to approaches based on CAD models and PBR data. We additionally demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of our pipeline on self-collected real-world objects, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art CAD-model-free approaches, with better accuracy and robustness to mild occlusions.

Our approach combines keypoint-based method with learnable pose regression through `keypoint-graph', which is a graph representation of the keypoints. KGpose first estimates 3D keypoints for each object using an attentional multi-modal feature fusion of RGB and point cloud features. These keypoints are estimated from each point of point cloud and converted into a graph representation. The network directly regresses 6D pose parameters for each point through a sequence of keypoint-graph embedding and local graph embedding which are designed with graph convolutions, followed by rotation and translation heads. The final pose for each object is selected from the candidates of point-wise predictions. The method achieves competitive results on the benchmark dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. KGpose enables multi-object pose estimation without requiring an extra localization step, offering a unified and efficient solution for understanding geometric contexts in complex scenes for robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work we present Horyon, an open-vocabulary VLM-based architecture that addresses relative pose estimation between two scenes of an unseen object, described by a textual prompt only. We use the textual prompt to identify the unseen object in the scenes and then obtain high-resolution multi-scale features. These features are used to extract cross-scene matches for registration. We evaluate our model on a benchmark with a large variety of unseen objects across four datasets, namely REAL275, Toyota-Light, Linemod, and YCB-Video.

In contrast to existing approaches, in our setting (i) the object of interest is specified solely through the textual prompt, (ii) no object model (e.g., CAD or video sequence) is required at inference, and (iii) the object is imaged from two RGBD viewpoints of different scenes. To operate in this setting, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model to segment the object of interest from the scenes and to estimate its relative 6D pose. The key of our approach is a carefully devised strategy to fuse object-level information provided by the prompt with local image features, resulting in a feature space that can generalize to novel concepts. We validate our approach on a new benchmark based on two popular datasets, REAL275 and Toyota-Light, which collectively encompass 34 object instances appearing in four thousand image pairs. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both a well-established hand-crafted method and a recent deep learning-based baseline in estimating the relative 6D pose of objects in different scenes.

We train a Diffusion Model to bridge this gap using a relatively small dataset of real-world images randomly collected from unlabeled everyday objects via the DIGIT sensor. Subsequently, we employ a simulator to generate images by uniformly sampling the surface of objects from the YCB Model Set. These simulated images are then translated into the real domain using the Diffusion Model and automatically labeled to train a classifier. During this training, we further align features of the two domains using an adversarial procedure. Our evaluation is conducted on a dataset of tactile images obtained from a set of ten 3D printed YCB objects. The results reveal a total accuracy of 81.9%, a significant improvement compared to the 34.7% achieved by the classifier trained solely on simulated images. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. We further validate our approach using the classifier on a 6D object pose estimation task from tactile data.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, accepted to ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Learning based approaches typically require training data from a highly accurate CAD model or labeled training data acquired using a complex setup. We address this by learning to estimate pose from weakly labeled data without a known CAD model. We propose to use a NeRF to learn object shape implicitly which is later used to learn view-invariant features in conjunction with CNN using a contrastive loss. While NeRF helps in learning features that are view-consistent, CNN ensures that the learned features respect symmetry. During inference, CNN is used to predict view-invariant features which can be used to establish correspondences with the implicit 3d model in NeRF. The correspondences are then used to estimate the pose in the reference frame of NeRF. Our approach can also handle symmetric objects unlike other approaches using a similar training setup. Specifically, we learn viewpoint invariant, discriminative features using NeRF which are later used for pose estimation. We evaluated our approach on LM, LM-Occlusion, and T-Less dataset and achieved benchmark accuracy despite using weakly labeled data.</p></details> | 3DV 2024 |

This scarcity impedes comprehensive evaluation of model performance, limiting research advancements. Furthermore, the restricted number of available instances or categories curtails its applications. To address these issues, this paper introduces Omni6DPose, a substantial dataset characterized by its diversity in object categories, large scale, and variety in object materials. Omni6DPose is divided into three main components: ROPE (Real 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), which includes 332K images annotated with over 1.5M annotations across 581 instances in 149 categories; SOPE(Simulated 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), consisting of 475K images created in a mixed reality setting with depth simulation, annotated with over 5M annotations across 4162 instances in the same 149 categories; and the manually aligned real scanned objects used in both ROPE and SOPE. Omni6DPose is inherently challenging due to the substantial variations and ambiguities. To address this challenge, we introduce GenPose++, an enhanced version of the SOTA category-level pose estimation framework, incorporating two pivotal improvements: Semantic-aware feature extraction and Clustering-based aggregation. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive benchmarking analysis to evaluate the performance of previous methods on this large-scale dataset in the realms of 6D object pose estimation and pose tracking.</p></details> |  |

Given challenges like rust, high reflectivity, and absent textures, this paper introduces a point cloud based pose estimation framework (PS6D). PS6D centers on slender and multi-symmetric objects. It extracts multi-scale features through an attention-guided feature extraction module, designs a symmetry-aware rotation loss and a center distance sensitive translation loss to regress the pose of each point to the centroid of the instance, and then uses a two-stage clustering method to complete instance segmentation and pose estimation. Objects from the Sil\'eane and IPA datasets and typical workpieces from industrial practice are used to generate data and evaluate the algorithm. In comparison to the state-of-the-art approach, PS6D demonstrates an 11.5\% improvement in F$_{1_{inst}}$ and a 14.8\% improvement in Recall. The main part of PS6D has been deployed to the software of Mech-Mind, and achieves a 91.7\% success rate in bin-picking experiments, marking its application in industrial pose estimation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Domain randomization hereby plays an important role in reducing the simulation to reality gap. However, this generalization might not be effective in specialized domains like a production environment involving complex assemblies. Either the individual parts, trained with synthetic images, are integrated in much larger assemblies making them indistinguishable from their counterparts and result in false positives or are partially occluded just enough to give rise to false negatives. Domain knowledge is vital in these cases and if conceived effectively while generating synthetic data, can show a considerable improvement in bridging the simulation to reality gap. This paper focuses on synthetic data generation procedures for parts and assemblies used in a production environment. The basic procedures for synthetic data generation and their various combinations are evaluated and compared on images captured in a production environment, where results show up to 15% improvement using combinations of basic procedures. Reducing the simulation to reality gap in this way can aid to utilize the true potential of robot assisted production using artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, LaTeX; typos corrected; has not been presented in any conference or published in journal</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose MatchU, a Fuse-Describe-Match strategy for 6D pose estimation from RGB-D images. MatchU is a generic approach that fuses 2D texture and 3D geometric cues for 6D pose prediction of unseen objects. We rely on learning geometric 3D descriptors that are rotation-invariant by design. By encoding pose-agnostic geometry, the learned descriptors naturally generalize to unseen objects and capture symmetries. To tackle ambiguous associations using 3D geometry only, we fuse additional RGB information into our descriptor. This is achieved through a novel attention-based mechanism that fuses cross-modal information, together with a matching loss that leverages the latent space learned from RGB data to guide the descriptor learning process. Extensive experiments reveal the generalizability of both the RGB-D fusion strategy as well as the descriptor efficacy. Benefiting from the novel designs, MatchU surpasses all existing methods by a significant margin in terms of both accuracy and speed, even without the requirement of expensive re-training or rendering.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, in high risk scenarios such as human-robot interaction, industrial inspection, and automation, reliable pose estimates are crucial. In the last years, increasingly accurate and robust deep-learning-based approaches for 6D object pose estimation have been proposed. Many top-performing methods are not end-to-end trainable but consist of multiple stages. In the context of deep uncertainty quantification, deep ensembles are considered as state of the art since they have been proven to produce well-calibrated and robust uncertainty estimates. However, deep ensembles can only be applied to methods that can be trained end-to-end. In this work, we propose a method to quantify the uncertainty of multi-stage 6D object pose estimation approaches with deep ensembles. For the implementation, we choose SurfEmb as representative, since it is one of the top-performing 6D object pose estimation approaches in the BOP Challenge 2022. We apply established metrics and concepts for deep uncertainty quantification to evaluate the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel uncertainty calibration score for regression tasks to quantify the quality of the estimated uncertainty.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In this area, dense correspondence-based methods have achieved leading performance. However, they do not explicitly consider the local and global geometric information of different instances, resulting in poor generalization ability to unseen instances with significant shape variations. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel Instance-Adaptive and Geometric-Aware Keypoint Learning method for category-level 6D object pose estimation (AG-Pose), which includes two key designs: (1) The first design is an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Detection module, which can adaptively detect a set of sparse keypoints for various instances to represent their geometric structures. (2) The second design is a Geometric-Aware Feature Aggregation module, which can efficiently integrate the local and global geometric information into keypoint features. These two modules can work together to establish robust keypoint-level correspondences for unseen instances, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the model.Experimental results on CAMERA25 and REAL275 datasets show that the proposed AG-Pose outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin without category-specific shape priors.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

We bridge the gap between these two setups with a neural implicit representation that allows for effective novel view synthesis, keeping the downstream pose estimation modules invariant under the same unified framework. Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation. Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin.

In this paper, we propose HOIDiffusion for generating realistic and diverse 3D hand-object interaction data. Our model is a conditional diffusion model that takes both the 3D hand-object geometric structure and text description as inputs for image synthesis. This offers a more controllable and realistic synthesis as we can specify the structure and style inputs in a disentangled manner. HOIDiffusion is trained by leveraging a diffusion model pre-trained on large-scale natural images and a few 3D human demonstrations. Beyond controllable image synthesis, we adopt the generated 3D data for learning 6D object pose estimation and show its effectiveness in improving perception systems.

Specifically, previous methods for novel objects do not make good use of the target object's 3D shape information since they focus on generalization by processing the shape indirectly, making them less effective. We present GenFlow, an approach that enables both accuracy and generalization to novel objects with the guidance of the target object's shape. Our method predicts optical flow between the rendered image and the observed image and refines the 6D pose iteratively. It boosts the performance by a constraint of the 3D shape and the generalizable geometric knowledge learned from an end-to-end differentiable system. We further improve our model by designing a cascade network architecture to exploit the multi-scale correlations and coarse-to-fine refinement. GenFlow ranked first on the unseen object pose estimation benchmarks in both the RGB and RGB-D cases. It also achieves performance competitive with existing state-of-the-art methods for the seen object pose estimation without any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic Task Success Evaluation Under Multi-modal Non-Parametric Object Pose Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10874v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D object pose estimation is essential for various robotic tasks. Uncertain pose estimates can lead to task failures; however, a certain degree of error in the pose estimates is often acceptable. Hence, by quantifying errors in the object pose estimate and acceptable errors for task success, robots can make informed decisions. This is a challenging problem as both the object pose uncertainty and acceptable error for the robotic task are often multi-modal and cannot be parameterized with commonly used uni-modal distributions. In this paper, we introduce a framework for evaluating robotic task success under object pose uncertainty, representing both the estimated error space of the object pose and the acceptable error space for task success using multi-modal non-parametric probability distributions. The proposed framework pre-computes the acceptable error space for task success using dynamic simulations and subsequently integrates the pre-computed acceptable error space over the estimated error space of the object pose to predict the likelihood of the task success. We evaluated the proposed framework on two mobile manipulation tasks. Our results show that by representing the estimated and the acceptable error space using multi-modal non-parametric distributions, we achieve higher task success rates and fewer failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

GigaPose first leverages discriminative "templates", rendered images of the CAD models, to recover the out-of-plane rotation and then uses patch correspondences to estimate the four remaining parameters. Our approach samples templates in only a two-degrees-of-freedom space instead of the usual three and matches the input image to the templates using fast nearest-neighbor search in feature space, results in a speedup factor of 35x compared to the state of the art. Moreover, GigaPose is significantly more robust to segmentation errors. Our extensive evaluation on the seven core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated with existing refinement methods. Additionally, we show the potential of GigaPose with 3D models predicted by recent work on 3D reconstruction from a single image, relaxing the need for CAD models and making 6D pose object estimation much more convenient.

Despite the impressive progress enabled by deep learning, single-view RGB pose estimation models perform poorly in cluttered dynamic environments. Imbuing the rich temporal information contained in the video of scenes has the potential to enhance models ability to deal with the adverse effects of occlusion and the dynamic nature of the environments. Moreover, joint object detection and pose estimation models are better suited to leverage the co-dependent nature of the tasks for improving the accuracy of both tasks. To this end, we propose attention-based temporal fusion for multi-object 6D pose estimation that accumulates information across multiple frames of a video sequence. Our MOTPose method takes a sequence of images as input and performs joint object detection and pose estimation for all objects in one forward pass. It learns to aggregate both object embeddings and object parameters over multiple time steps using cross-attention-based fusion modules. We evaluate our method on the physically-realistic cluttered bin-picking dataset SynPick and the YCB-Video dataset and demonstrate improved pose estimation accuracy as well as better object detection accuracy</p></details> |  |

Fortunately, the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has showcased remarkable zero-shot transfer performance, which provides a promising solution to tackle this task. Motivated by this, we introduce SAM-6D, a novel framework designed to realize the task through two steps, including instance segmentation and pose estimation. Given the target objects, SAM-6D employs two dedicated sub-networks, namely Instance Segmentation Model (ISM) and Pose Estimation Model (PEM), to perform these steps on cluttered RGB-D images. ISM takes SAM as an advanced starting point to generate all possible object proposals and selectively preserves valid ones through meticulously crafted object matching scores in terms of semantics, appearance and geometry. By treating pose estimation as a partial-to-partial point matching problem, PEM performs a two-stage point matching process featuring a novel design of background tokens to construct dense 3D-3D correspondence, ultimately yielding the pose estimates. Without bells and whistles, SAM-6D outperforms the existing methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark for both instance segmentation and pose estimation of novel objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2024.

Current methods for scene understanding typically rely on a combination of trained models paired with either an explicit or learnt volumetric representation, all of which have their own drawbacks and limitations. We introduce DreamUp3D, a novel Object-Centric Generative Model (OCGM) designed explicitly to perform inference on a 3D scene informed only by a single RGB-D image. DreamUp3D is a self-supervised model, trained end-to-end, and is capable of segmenting objects, providing 3D object reconstructions, generating object-centric latent representations and accurate per-object 6D pose estimates. We compare DreamUp3D to baselines including NeRFs, pre-trained CLIP-features, ObSurf, and ObPose, in a range of tasks including 3D scene reconstruction, object matching and object pose estimation. Our experiments show that our model outperforms all baselines by a significant margin in real-world scenarios displaying its applicability for 3D scene understanding tasks while meeting the strict demands exhibited in robotics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving 2D-3D Dense Correspondences with Diffusion Models for 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06436v1)** | 2024-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating 2D-3D correspondences between RGB images and 3D space is a fundamental problem in 6D object pose estimation. Recent pose estimators use dense correspondence maps and Point-to-Point algorithms to estimate object poses. The accuracy of pose estimation depends heavily on the quality of the dense correspondence maps and their ability to withstand occlusion, clutter, and challenging material properties. Currently, dense correspondence maps are estimated using image-to-image translation models based on GANs, Autoencoders, or direct regression models. However, recent advancements in image-to-image translation have led to diffusion models being the superior choice when evaluated on benchmarking datasets. In this study, we compare image-to-image translation networks based on GANs and diffusion models for the downstream task of 6D object pose estimation. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion-based image-to-image translation model outperforms the GAN, revealing potential for further improvements in 6D object pose estimation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the First Austrian Symposium on AI, Robotics, and Vision 2024</p></details> |

The prior can be used to initialize the 3D object translation and facilitate 3D object rotation estimation. Unfortunately, the object detectors that are used for this purpose do not generalize to unseen objects. Therefore, existing 6D pose estimation methods for unseen objects either assume the ground-truth object location to be known or yield inaccurate results when it is unavailable. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a method, LocPoseNet, able to robustly learn location prior for unseen objects. Our method builds upon a template matching strategy, where we propose to distribute the reference kernels and convolve them with a query to efficiently compute multi-scale correlations. We then introduce a novel translation estimator, which decouples scale-aware and scale-robust features to predict different object location parameters. Our method outperforms existing works by a large margin on LINEMOD and GenMOP. We further construct a challenging synthetic dataset, which allows us to highlight the better robustness of our method to various noise sources.

There are two main deep learning approaches for this: geometric representation regression and iterative refinement. However, these methods have some limitations that reduce their effectiveness. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and propose new strategies to overcome them. To tackle the issue of blurry geometric representation, we use positional encoding with high-frequency components for the object's 3D coordinates. To address the local minimum problem in refinement methods, we introduce a normalized image plane-based multi-reference refinement strategy that's independent of intrinsic matrix constraints. Lastly, we utilize adaptive instance normalization and a simple occlusion augmentation method to help our model concentrate on the target object. Our experiments on Linemod, Linemod-Occlusion, and YCB-Video datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods. We will soon release the code.</p></details> |  |

To evaluate the robustness of SNEs on noisy data, we create a large-scale synthetic surface normal (SSN) dataset containing 20 scenarios (ten indoor scenarios and ten outdoor scenarios with and without random Gaussian noise added to depth images). Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3F2N+ achieves greater performance than all other geometry-based surface normal estimators, with average angular errors of 7.85$^\circ$, 8.95$^\circ$, 9.25$^\circ$, and 11.98$^\circ$ on the clean-indoor, clean-outdoor, noisy-indoor, and noisy-outdoor datasets, respectively. We conduct three additional experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating our proposed 3F2N+ into downstream robot perception tasks, including freespace detection, 6D object pose estimation, and point cloud completion.

Building on successful instance-level approaches, research is shifting towards category-level pose estimation for practical applications. Current category-level datasets, however, fall short in annotation quality and pose variety. Addressing this, we introduce HouseCat6D, a new category-level 6D pose dataset.

| **[Visually Guided Model Predictive Robot Control via 6D Object Pose Localization and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05344v1)** | 2023-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of this work is to enable manipulation tasks with respect to the 6D pose of a dynamically moving object using a camera mounted on a robot. Examples include maintaining a constant relative 6D pose of the robot arm with respect to the object, grasping the dynamically moving object, or co-manipulating the object together with a human. Fast and accurate 6D pose estimation is crucial to achieve smooth and stable robot control in such situations. The contributions of this work are three fold. First, we propose a new visual perception module that asynchronously combines accurate learning-based 6D object pose localizer and a high-rate model-based 6D pose tracker. The outcome is a low-latency accurate and temporally consistent 6D object pose estimation from the input video stream at up to 120 Hz. Second, we develop a visually guided robot arm controller that combines the new visual perception module with a torque-based model predictive control algorithm. Asynchronous combination of the visual and robot proprioception signals at their corresponding frequencies results in stable and robust 6D object pose guided robot arm control. Third, we experimentally validate the proposed approach on a challenging 6D pose estimation benchmark and demonstrate 6D object pose-guided control with dynamically moving objects on a real 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE(3) Diffusion Model-based Point Cloud Registration for Robust 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17359v1)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce an SE(3) diffusion model-based point cloud registration framework for 6D object pose estimation in real-world scenarios. Our approach formulates the 3D registration task as a denoising diffusion process, which progressively refines the pose of the source point cloud to obtain a precise alignment with the model point cloud. Training our framework involves two operations: An SE(3) diffusion process and an SE(3) reverse process. The SE(3) diffusion process gradually perturbs the optimal rigid transformation of a pair of point clouds by continuously injecting noise (perturbation transformation). By contrast, the SE(3) reverse process focuses on learning a denoising network that refines the noisy transformation step-by-step, bringing it closer to the optimal transformation for accurate pose estimation. Unlike standard diffusion models used in linear Euclidean spaces, our diffusion model operates on the SE(3) manifold. This requires exploiting the linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{se}(3)$ associated with SE(3) to constrain the transformation transitions during the diffusion and reverse processes. Additionally, to effectively train our denoising network, we derive a registration-specific variational lower bound as the optimization objective for model learning. Furthermore, we show that our denoising network can be constructed with a surrogate registration model, making our approach applicable to different deep registration networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our diffusion registration framework presents outstanding pose estimation performance on the real-world TUD-L, LINEMOD, and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS-2023</p></details> |

At any given time during the manipulation of the object, we assume access to the robot joint controls and an image from a camera. We use the robot joint controls to perform a physics-based prediction of how the object might be moving. We then combine this prediction with the observation coming from the camera, to estimate the object pose as accurately as possible. We use a particle filtering approach to combine the control information with the visual information. We compare the proposed method with two baselines: (i) using only an image-based pose estimation system at each time-step, and (ii) a particle filter which does not perform the computationally expensive physics predictions, but assumes the object moves with constant velocity. Our results show that making physics-based predictions is worth the computational cost, resulting in more accurate tracking, and estimating object pose even when the object is not clearly visible to the camera.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to learn 6D poses for roboticassembly by natural language instructions. For this purpose, Language-Instructed 6D Pose Regression Network (LanPose) is proposed to jointly predict the 6D poses of the observed object and the corresponding assembly position. Our proposed approach is based on the fusion of geometric and linguistic features, which allows us to finely integrate multi-modality input and map it to the 6D pose in SE(3) space by the cross-attention mechanism and the language-integrated 6D pose mapping module, respectively. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, an integrated robotic system is established to precisely and robustly perceive, grasp, manipulate and assemble blocks by language commands. 98.09 and 93.55 in ADD(-S)-0.1d are derived for the prediction of 6D object pose and 6D assembly pose, respectively. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed language-instructed 6D pose estimation methodology and its potential to enable robots to better understand and execute natural language instructions.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In contrast to ``instance-level" and ``category-level" pose estimation methods, our algorithm learns object representation in a category-agnostic way, which endows it with strong generalization capabilities across object categories. Specifically, we employ a neural process-based meta-learning approach to train an encoder to capture texture and geometry of an object in a latent representation, based on very few RGB-D images and ground-truth keypoints. The latent representation is then used by a simultaneously meta-trained decoder to predict the 6D pose of the object in new images. Furthermore, we propose a novel geometry-aware decoder for the keypoint prediction using a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which explicitly takes geometric constraints specific to each object into consideration. To evaluate our algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on the \linemod dataset, and on our new fully-annotated synthetic datasets generated from Multiple Categories in Multiple Scenes (MCMS). Experimental results demonstrate that our model performs well on unseen objects with very different shapes and appearances. Remarkably, our model also shows robust performance on occluded scenes although trained fully on data without occlusion.

| **[Linear-Covariance Loss for End-to-End Learning of 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11516v2)** | 2023-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most modern image-based 6D object pose estimation methods learn to predict 2D-3D correspondences, from which the pose can be obtained using a PnP solver. Because of the non-differentiable nature of common PnP solvers, these methods are supervised via the individual correspondences. To address this, several methods have designed differentiable PnP strategies, thus imposing supervision on the pose obtained after the PnP step. Here, we argue that this conflicts with the averaging nature of the PnP problem, leading to gradients that may encourage the network to degrade the accuracy of individual correspondences. To address this, we derive a loss function that exploits the ground truth pose before solving the PnP problem. Specifically, we linearize the PnP solver around the ground-truth pose and compute the covariance of the resulting pose distribution. We then define our loss based on the diagonal covariance elements, which entails considering the final pose estimate yet not suffering from the PnP averaging issue. Our experiments show that our loss consistently improves the pose estimation accuracy for both dense and sparse correspondence based methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on both Linemod-Occluded and YCB-Video.</p></details> |  |

We argue that learning point-level discriminative features is overlooked in the literature. To this end, we revisit Fully Convolutional Geometric Features (FCGF) and tailor it for object 6D pose estimation to achieve state-of-the-art performance. FCGF employs sparse convolutions and learns point-level features using a fully-convolutional network by optimising a hardest contrastive loss. We can outperform recent competitors on popular benchmarks by adopting key modifications to the loss and to the input data representations, by carefully tuning the training strategies, and by employing data augmentations suitable for the underlying problem.

The state-of-the-art 6D object pose estimation methods rely on object-specific training and therefore do not generalize to unseen objects. Recent novel object pose estimation methods are solving this issue using task-specific fine-tuned CNNs for deep template matching. This adaptation for pose estimation still requires expensive data rendering and training procedures. MegaPose for example is trained on a dataset consisting of two million images showing 20,000 different objects to reach such generalization capabilities. To overcome this shortcoming we introduce ZS6D, for zero-shot novel object 6D pose estimation. Visual descriptors, extracted using pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT), are used for matching rendered templates against query images of objects and for establishing local correspondences. These local correspondences enable deriving geometric correspondences and are used for estimating the object's 6D pose with RANSAC-based PnP. This approach showcases that the image descriptors extracted by pre-trained ViTs are well-suited to achieve a notable improvement over two state-of-the-art novel object 6D pose estimation methods, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments are performed on LMO, YCBV, and TLESS. In comparison to one of the two methods we improve the Average Recall on all three datasets and compared to the second method we improve on two datasets.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, underwater target pose estimation is remarkably challenging due to, among many factors, limited visibility, light scattering, cluttered environments, and constantly varying water conditions. An approach is to employ sonar or laser sensing to acquire 3D data, however, the data is not clear and the sensors expensive. For this reason, the community has focused on extracting pose estimates from RGB input. In this work, we propose an approach that leverages 2D object detection to reliably compute 6D pose estimates in different underwater scenarios. We test our proposal with 4 objects with symmetrical shapes and poor texture spanning across 33,920 synthetic and 10 real scenes. All objects and scenes are made available in an open-source dataset that includes annotations for object detection and pose estimation. When benchmarking against similar end-to-end methodologies for 6D object pose estimation, our pipeline provides estimates that are 8% more accurate. We also demonstrate the real world usability of our pose estimation pipeline on an underwater robotic manipulator in a reaching task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under RA-L Submission</p></details> |
| **[Exploiting Point-Wise Attention in 6D Object Pose Estimation Based on Bidirectional Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08518v3)** | 2023-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional geometric registration based estimation methods only exploit the CAD model implicitly, which leads to their dependence on observation quality and deficiency to occlusion. To address the problem,the paper proposes a bidirectional correspondence prediction network with a point-wise attention-aware mechanism. This network not only requires the model points to predict the correspondence but also explicitly models the geometric similarities between observations and the model prior. Our key insight is that the correlations between each model point and scene point provide essential information for learning point-pair matches. To further tackle the correlation noises brought by feature distribution divergence, we design a simple but effective pseudo-siamese network to improve feature homogeneity. Experimental results on the public datasets of LineMOD, YCB-Video, and Occ-LineMOD show that the proposed method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art methods under the same evaluation criteria. Its robustness in estimating poses is greatly improved, especially in an environment with severe occlusions.</p></details> |  |

Our key insight is that the accuracy of the 6D object pose estimate can be improved by explicitly completing the shape of the object. To this end, we introduce a novel visuotactile shape completion module that uses a conditional Generative Adversarial Network to complete the shape of an in-hand object based on volumetric representation. This approach improves over prior works that directly regress visuotactile observations to a 6D pose. By explicitly completing the shape of the in-hand object and jointly optimizing the shape completion and pose estimation tasks, we improve the accuracy of the 6D object pose estimate. We train and test our model on a synthetic dataset and compare it with the state-of-the-art. In the visuotactile shape completion task, we outperform the state-of-the-art by 265% using the Intersection of Union metric and achieve 88% lower Chamfer Distance. In the visuotactile pose estimation task, we present results that suggest our framework reduces position and angular errors by 35% and 64%, respectively. Furthermore, we ablate our framework to confirm the gain on the 6D object pose estimate from explicitly completing the shape. Ultimately, we show that our framework produces models that are robust to sim-to-real transfer on a real-world robot platform.</p></details> | Accepted by RA-L |

Existing deep learning approaches for 6D pose estimation typically rely on the assumption of availability of 3D object models and 6D pose annotations. However, precise annotation of 6D poses in real data is intricate, time-consuming and not scalable, while synthetic data scales well but lacks realism. To avoid these problems, we present a weakly-supervised reconstruction-based pipeline, named NeRF-Pose, which needs only 2D object segmentation and known relative camera poses during training. Following the first-reconstruct-then-regress idea, we first reconstruct the objects from multiple views in the form of an implicit neural representation. Then, we train a pose regression network to predict pixel-wise 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model. At inference, the approach only needs a single image as input. A NeRF-enabled PnP+RANSAC algorithm is used to estimate stable and accurate pose from the predicted correspondences. Experiments on LineMod and LineMod-Occlusion show that the proposed method has state-of-the-art accuracy in comparison to the best 6D pose estimation methods in spite of being trained only with weak labels. Besides, we extend the Homebrewed DB dataset with more real training images to support the weakly supervised task and achieve compelling results on this dataset. The extended dataset and code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

Inverse graphics is an appealing approach to 3D scene understanding that aims to infer the 3D scene structure from 2D images. In this paper, we introduce probabilistic modeling to the inverse graphics framework to quantify uncertainty and achieve robustness in 6D pose estimation tasks. Specifically, we propose 3D Neural Embedding Likelihood (3DNEL) as a unified probabilistic model over RGB-D images, and develop efficient inference procedures on 3D scene descriptions. 3DNEL effectively combines learned neural embeddings from RGB with depth information to improve robustness in sim-to-real 6D object pose estimation from RGB-D images. Performance on the YCB-Video dataset is on par with state-of-the-art yet is much more robust in challenging regimes. In contrast to discriminative approaches, 3DNEL's probabilistic generative formulation jointly models multiple objects in a scene, quantifies uncertainty in a principled way, and handles object pose tracking under heavy occlusion. Finally, 3DNEL provides a principled framework for incorporating prior knowledge about the scene and objects, which allows natural extension to additional tasks like camera pose tracking from video.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2023 camera ready</p></details> |

While recent approaches take categorical shape prior information as reference to improve pose estimation accuracy, the single-stage network design and training manner lead to sub-optimal performance since there are two distinct tasks in the pipeline. In this paper, the advantage of two-stage pipeline over single-stage design is discussed. To this end, we propose a two-stage deformation-and registration pipeline called DR-Pose, which consists of completion-aided deformation stage and scaled registration stage. The first stage uses a point cloud completion method to generate unseen parts of target object, guiding subsequent deformation on the shape prior. In the second stage, a novel registration network is designed to extract pose-sensitive features and predict the representation of object partial point cloud in canonical space based on the deformation results from the first stage. DR-Pose produces superior results to the state-of-the-art shape prior-based methods on both CAMERA25 and REAL275 benchmarks.

To achieve this, we employ a dense 2D-to-3D correspondence predictor that regresses 3D model coordinates for every pixel. In addition to the 3D coordinates, our model also estimates the pixel-wise coordinate error to discard correspondences that are likely wrong. This allows us to generate multiple 6D pose hypotheses of the object, which we then refine iteratively using a highly efficient region-based approach. We also introduce a novel pixel-wise posterior formulation by which we can estimate the probability for each hypothesis and select the most likely one. As we show in experiments, our approach is capable of dealing with extreme visual conditions including overexposure, high contrast, or low signal-to-noise ratio. This makes it a powerful technique for the particularly challenging task of estimating the pose of tumbling satellites for in-orbit robotic applications. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SPEED+ dataset and has won the SPEC2021 post-mortem competition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a 6D object pose estimation method that can be trained with pure RGB images without any auxiliary information. We first obtain a rough pose initialization from networks trained on synthetic images rendered from the target's 3D mesh. Then, we introduce a refinement strategy leveraging the geometry constraint in synthetic-to-real image pairs from multiple different views. We formulate this geometry constraint as pixel-level flow consistency between the training images with dynamically generated pseudo labels. We evaluate our method on three challenging datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods significantly, with neither 2D annotations nor additional depth images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel rotation estimation network, termed as VI-Net, to make the task easier by decoupling the rotation as the combination of a viewpoint rotation and an in-plane rotation. More specifically, VI-Net bases the feature learning on the sphere with two individual branches for the estimates of two factorized rotations, where a V-Branch is employed to learn the viewpoint rotation via binary classification on the spherical signals, while another I-Branch is used to estimate the in-plane rotation by transforming the signals to view from the zenith direction. To process the spherical signals, a Spherical Feature Pyramid Network is constructed based on a novel design of SPAtial Spherical Convolution (SPA-SConv), which settles the boundary problem of spherical signals via feature padding and realizesviewpoint-equivariant feature extraction by symmetric convolutional operations. We apply the proposed VI-Net to the challenging task of category-level 6D object pose estimation for predicting the poses of unknown objects without available CAD models; experiments on the benchmarking datasets confirm the efficacy of our method, which outperforms the existing ones with a large margin in the regime of high precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV2023.

In this work, we tackle this problem by a novel Deep Fusion Transformer~(DFTr) block that can aggregate cross-modality features for improving pose estimation. Unlike existing fusion methods, the proposed DFTr can better model cross-modality semantic correlation by leveraging their semantic similarity, such that globally enhanced features from different modalities can be better integrated for improved information extraction. Moreover, to further improve robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel weighted vector-wise voting algorithm that employs a non-iterative global optimization strategy for precise 3D keypoint localization while achieving near real-time inference. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and strong generalization capability of our proposed 3D keypoint voting algorithm. Results on four widely used benchmarks also demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2023 |

The state-of-the-art models for pose estimation are convolutional neural network (CNN)-based. Lately, Transformers, an architecture originally proposed for natural language processing, is achieving state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks as well. Equipped with the multi-head self-attention mechanism, Transformers enable simple single-stage end-to-end architectures for learning object detection and 6D object pose estimation jointly. In this work, we propose YOLOPose (short form for You Only Look Once Pose estimation), a Transformer-based multi-object 6D pose estimation method based on keypoint regression and an improved variant of the YOLOPose model. In contrast to the standard heatmaps for predicting keypoints in an image, we directly regress the keypoints. Additionally, we employ a learnable orientation estimation module to predict the orientation from the keypoints. Along with a separate translation estimation module, our model is end-to-end differentiable. Our method is suitable for real-time applications and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We analyze the role of object queries in our architecture and reveal that the object queries specialize in detecting objects in specific image regions. Furthermore, we quantify the accuracy trade-off of using datasets of smaller sizes to train our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Robot...</summary><p>Robotics and Autonomous Systems Journal, Elsevier, to appear 2023. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2205.02536</p></details> |

Monocular object pose estimation gained considerable momentum with the rise of high-performing deep learning-based solutions and is particularly interesting for the community since sensors are inexpensive and inference is fast. Prior works establish the comprehensive state of the art for diverse pose estimation problems. Their broad scopes make it difficult to identify promising future directions. We narrow down the scope to the problem of single-shot monocular 6D object pose estimation, which is commonly used in robotics, and thus are able to identify such trends. By reviewing recent publications in robotics and computer vision, the state of the art is established at the union of both fields. Following that, we identify promising research directions in order to help researchers to formulate relevant research ideas and effectively advance the state of the art. Findings include that methods are sophisticated enough to overcome the domain shift and that occlusion handling is a fundamental challenge. We also highlight problems such as novel object pose estimation and challenging materials handling as central challenges to advance robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version in the making</p></details> |

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based approaches for pose estimation have been previously introduced. However, the quest for better performance still persists especially for accurate robotics manipulation. This quest extends to the Agri-robotics domain. In this paper, we propose TransPose, an improved Transformer-based 6D pose estimation with a depth refinement module. The architecture takes in only an RGB image as input with no additional supplementing modalities such as depth or thermal images. The architecture encompasses an innovative lighter depth estimation network that estimates depth from an RGB image using feature pyramid with an up-sampling method. A transformer-based detection network with additional prediction heads is proposed to directly regress the object's centre and predict the 6D pose of the target. A novel depth refinement module is then used alongside the predicted centers, 6D poses and depth patches to refine the accuracy of the estimated 6D pose. We extensively compared our results with other state-of-the-art methods and analysed our results for fruit-picking applications. The results we achieved show that our proposed technique outperforms the other methods available in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Most 6D pose estimators, however, rely on a single camera frame and suffer from occlusions and ambiguities due to object symmetries. We overcome this issue by presenting a novel symmetry-aware multi-view 6D pose estimator called SyMFM6D. Our approach efficiently fuses the RGB-D frames from multiple perspectives in a deep multi-directional fusion network and predicts predefined keypoints for all objects in the scene simultaneously. Based on the keypoints and an instance semantic segmentation, we efficiently compute the 6D poses by least-squares fitting. To address the ambiguity issues for symmetric objects, we propose a novel training procedure for symmetry-aware keypoint detection including a new objective function. Our SyMFM6D network significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in both single-view and multi-view 6D pose estimation. We furthermore show the effectiveness of our symmetry-aware training procedure and demonstrate that our approach is robust towards inaccurate camera calibration and dynamic camera setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) 2023</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Proprioceptive 6D Pose Estimation of In-hand Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15858v1)** | 2023-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation, in particular in-hand object manipulation, often requires an accurate estimate of the object's 6D pose. To improve the accuracy of the estimated pose, state-of-the-art approaches in 6D object pose estimation use observational data from one or more modalities, e.g., RGB images, depth, and tactile readings. However, existing approaches make limited use of the underlying geometric structure of the object captured by these modalities, thereby, increasing their reliance on visual features. This results in poor performance when presented with objects that lack such visual features or when visual features are simply occluded. Furthermore, current approaches do not take advantage of the proprioceptive information embedded in the position of the fingers. To address these limitations, in this paper: (1) we introduce a hierarchical graph neural network architecture for combining multimodal (vision and touch) data that allows for a geometrically informed 6D object pose estimation, (2) we introduce a hierarchical message passing operation that flows the information within and across modalities to learn a graph-based object representation, and (3) we introduce a method that accounts for the proprioceptive information for in-hand object representation. We evaluate our model on a diverse subset of objects from the YCB Object and Model Set, and show that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art work in accuracy and robustness to occlusion. We also deploy our proposed framework on a real robot and qualitatively demonstrate successful transfer to real settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shape-Constraint Recurrent Flow for 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13266v1)** | 2023-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most recent 6D object pose methods use 2D optical flow to refine their results. However, the general optical flow methods typically do not consider the target's 3D shape information during matching, making them less effective in 6D object pose estimation. In this work, we propose a shape-constraint recurrent matching framework for 6D object pose estimation. We first compute a pose-induced flow based on the displacement of 2D reprojection between the initial pose and the currently estimated pose, which embeds the target's 3D shape implicitly. Then we use this pose-induced flow to construct the correlation map for the following matching iterations, which reduces the matching space significantly and is much easier to learn. Furthermore, we use networks to learn the object pose based on the current estimated flow, which facilitates the computation of the pose-induced flow for the next iteration and yields an end-to-end system for object pose. Finally, we optimize the optical flow and object pose simultaneously in a recurrent manner. We evaluate our method on three challenging 6D object pose datasets and show that it outperforms the state of the art significantly in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | CVPR 2023 |

To address this problem, we propose DeepRM, a novel recurrent network architecture for 6D pose refinement. DeepRM leverages initial coarse pose estimates to render synthetic images of target objects. The rendered images are then matched with the observed images to predict a rigid transform for updating the previous pose estimate. This process is repeated to incrementally refine the estimate at each iteration. The DeepRM architecture incorporates LSTM units to propagate information through each refinement step, significantly improving overall performance. In contrast to current 2-stage Perspective-n-Point based solutions, DeepRM is trained end-to-end, and uses a scalable backbone that can be tuned via a single parameter for accuracy and efficiency. During training, a multi-scale optical flow head is added to predict the optical flow between the observed and synthetic images. Optical flow prediction stabilizes the training process, and enforces the learning of features that are relevant to the task of pose estimation. Our results demonstrate that DeepRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely accepted challenging datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, CVPR 2023 RHOBIN Workshop</p></details> |

A critical aspect of this interpretation is pose estimation: inferring quantities that describe the position and orientation of an object in 3D space. Most existing approaches to pose estimation make limiting assumptions, often working only for specific, known object instances, or at best generalising to an object category using large pose-labelled datasets. In this work, we present a method for achieving category-level pose estimation by inspection of just a single object from a desired category. We show that we can subsequently perform accurate pose estimation for unseen objects from an inspected category, and considerably outperform prior work by exploiting multi-view correspondences. We demonstrate that our method runs in real-time, enabling a robot manipulator equipped with an RGBD sensor to perform online 6D pose estimation for novel objects. Finally, we showcase our method in a continual learning setting, with a robot able to determine whether objects belong to known categories, and if not, use active perception to produce a one-shot category representation for subsequent pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, CoRL 2022</p></details> |

However, this task becomes more challenging in poor lighting conditions or when dealing with textureless objects. To address this issue, depth images are becoming an increasingly popular choice due to their invariance to a scene's appearance and the implicit incorporation of essential geometric characteristics. However, fully leveraging depth information to improve the performance of pose estimation remains a difficult and under-investigated problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework called SwinDePose, that uses only geometric information from depth images to achieve accurate 6D pose estimation. SwinDePose first calculates the angles between each normal vector defined in a depth image and the three coordinate axes in the camera coordinate system. The resulting angles are then formed into an image, which is encoded using Swin Transformer. Additionally, we apply RandLA-Net to learn the representations from point clouds. The resulting image and point clouds embeddings are concatenated and fed into a semantic segmentation module and a 3D keypoints localization module. Finally, we estimate 6D poses using a least-square fitting approach based on the target object's predicted semantic mask and 3D keypoints. In experiments on the LineMod and Occlusion LineMod datasets, SwinDePose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for 6D object pose estimation using depth images. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and highlights its potential for improving performance in real-world scenarios.

Despite the significant progress of 6D pose estimation methods, their performance is usually limited for heavily occluded objects, which is a common case in imitation learning, where the object is typically partially occluded by the manipulating hand. Currently, there is a lack of datasets that would enable the development of robust 6D pose estimation methods for these conditions. To overcome this problem, we collect a new dataset (Imitrob) aimed at 6D pose estimation in imitation learning and other applications where a human holds a tool and performs a task. The dataset contains image sequences of nine different tools and twelve manipulation tasks with two camera viewpoints, four human subjects, and left/right hand. Each image is accompanied by an accurate ground truth measurement of the 6D object pose obtained by the HTC Vive motion tracking device.

Previous methods have heavily relied on feature matching with great success. However, these methods are often inefficient and limited by their reliance on pre-trained models that have not be designed specifically for pose estimation. In this paper we propose PoseMatcher, an accurate model free one-shot object pose estimator that overcomes these limitations. We create a new training pipeline for object to image matching based on a three-view system: a query with a positive and negative templates. This simple yet effective approach emulates test time scenarios by cheaply constructing an approximation of the full object point cloud during training. To enable PoseMatcher to attend to distinct input modalities, an image and a pointcloud, we introduce IO-Layer, a new attention layer that efficiently accommodates self and cross attention between the inputs. Moreover, we propose a pruning strategy where we iteratively remove redundant regions of the target object to further reduce the complexity and noise of the network while maintaining accuracy. Finally we redesign commonly used pose refinement strategies, zoom and 2D offset refinements, and adapt them to the one-shot paradigm. We outperform all prior one-shot pose estimation methods on the Linemod and YCB-V datasets as well achieve results rivaling recent instance-level methods.

The problem becomes even more challenging when moving to category-level 6D pose, which requires generalization to unseen instances. Current approaches are restricted by leveraging annotations from simulation or collected from humans. In this paper, we overcome this barrier by introducing a self-supervised learning approach trained directly on large-scale real-world object videos for category-level 6D pose estimation in the wild. Our framework reconstructs the canonical 3D shape of an object category and learns dense correspondences between input images and the canonical shape via surface embedding. For training, we propose novel geometrical cycle-consistency losses which construct cycles across 2D-3D spaces, across different instances and different time steps. The learned correspondence can be applied for 6D pose estimation and other downstream tasks such as keypoint transfer. Surprisingly, our method, without any human annotations or simulators, can achieve on-par or even better performance than previous supervised or semi-supervised methods on in-the-wild images.

However, the general object detection methods they use are ill-suited to handle cluttered scenes, thus producing poor initialization to the subsequent pose network. To address this, we propose a rigidity-aware detection method exploiting the fact that, in 6D pose estimation, the target objects are rigid. This lets us introduce an approach to sampling positive object regions from the entire visible object area during training, instead of naively drawing samples from the bounding box center where the object might be occluded. As such, every visible object part can contribute to the final bounding box prediction, yielding better detection robustness. Key to the success of our approach is a visibility map, which we propose to build using a minimum barrier distance between every pixel in the bounding box and the box boundary. Our results on seven challenging 6D pose estimation datasets evidence that our method outperforms general detection frameworks by a large margin. Furthermore, combined with a pose regression network, we obtain state-of-the-art pose estimation results on the challenging BOP benchmark.</p></details> | CVPR 2023 |

While being successful, NOCS-based methods become inaccurate and less robust when handling objects of a category containing significant intra-category shape variations. This is because the object coordinates induced by global and rigid alignment of objects are semantically incoherent, making the coordinate regression hard to learn and generalize. We propose Semantically-aware Object Coordinate Space (SOCS) built by warping-and-aligning the objects guided by a sparse set of keypoints with semantically meaningful correspondence. SOCS is semantically coherent: Any point on the surface of a object can be mapped to a semantically meaningful location in SOCS, allowing for accurate pose and size estimation under large shape variations. To learn effective coordinate regression to SOCS, we propose a novel multi-scale coordinate-based attention network. Evaluations demonstrate that our method is easy to train, well-generalizing for large intra-category shape variations and robust to inter-object occlusions.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Our major contribution is a novel learning scheme which removes the drawbacks of previous works, namely the strong dependency on co-modalities or additional refinement. These have been previously necessary to provide training signals for convergence. We formulate such a scheme as two sub-optimisation problems on texture learning and pose learning. We separately learn to predict realistic texture of objects from real image collections and learn pose estimation from pixel-perfect synthetic data. Combining these two capabilities allows then to synthesise photorealistic novel views to supervise the pose estimator with accurate geometry. To alleviate pose noise and segmentation imperfection present during the texture learning phase, we propose a surfel-based adversarial training loss together with texture regularisation from synthetic data. We demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods without ground-truth pose annotations and demonstrates substantial generalisation improvements towards unseen scenes.

In 2022, we witnessed another significant improvement in the pose estimation accuracy -- the state of the art, which was 56.9 AR$_C$ in 2019 (Vidal et al.) and 69.8 AR$_C$ in 2020 (CosyPose), moved to new heights of 83.7 AR$_C$ (GDRNPP). Out of 49 pose estimation methods evaluated since 2019, the top 18 are from 2022. Methods based on point pair features, which were introduced in 2010 and achieved competitive results even in 2020, are now clearly outperformed by deep learning methods. The synthetic-to-real domain gap was again significantly reduced, with 82.7 AR$_C$ achieved by GDRNPP trained only on synthetic images from BlenderProc. The fastest variant of GDRNPP reached 80.5 AR$_C$ with an average time per image of 0.23s. Since most of the recent methods for 6D object pose estimation begin by detecting/segmenting objects, we also started evaluating 2D object detection and segmentation performance based on the COCO metrics. Compared to the Mask R-CNN results from CosyPose in 2020, detection improved from 60.3 to 77.3 AP$_C$ and segmentation from 40.5 to 58.7 AP$_C$.

| **[6D Pose Estimation for Textureless Objects on RGB Frames using Multi-View Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11554v2)** | 2023-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D pose estimation of textureless objects is a valuable but challenging task for many robotic applications. In this work, we propose a framework to address this challenge using only RGB images acquired from multiple viewpoints. The core idea of our approach is to decouple 6D pose estimation into a sequential two-step process, first estimating the 3D translation and then the 3D rotation of each object. This decoupled formulation first resolves the scale and depth ambiguities in single RGB images, and uses these estimates to accurately identify the object orientation in the second stage, which is greatly simplified with an accurate scale estimate. Moreover, to accommodate the multi-modal distribution present in rotation space, we develop an optimization scheme that explicitly handles object symmetries and counteracts measurement uncertainties. In comparison to the state-of-the-art multi-view approach, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves substantial improvements on a challenging 6D pose estimation dataset for textureless objects.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSDA: Monocular Self-supervised Domain Adaptation for 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07300v1)** | 2023-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring labeled 6D poses from real images is an expensive and time-consuming task. Though massive amounts of synthetic RGB images are easy to obtain, the models trained on them suffer from noticeable performance degradation due to the synthetic-to-real domain gap. To mitigate this degradation, we propose a practical self-supervised domain adaptation approach that takes advantage of real RGB(-D) data without needing real pose labels. We first pre-train the model with synthetic RGB images and then utilize real RGB(-D) images to fine-tune the pre-trained model. The fine-tuning process is self-supervised by the RGB-based pose-aware consistency and the depth-guided object distance pseudo-label, which does not require the time-consuming online differentiable rendering. We build our domain adaptation method based on the recent pose estimator SC6D and evaluate it on the YCB-Video dataset. We experimentally demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance against its fully-supervised counterpart while outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | SCIA2023 |

We reason on the possible spatial configurations of the sensors along the object surface. Specifically, we filter contact hypotheses using geometric reasoning and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained on simulated object-agnostic images, to promote those that better comply with the actual tactile images from the sensors. We use the selected sensors configurations to optimize over the space of 6D poses using a Gradient Descent-based approach. We finally rank the obtained poses by penalizing those that are in collision with the sensors. We carry out experiments in simulation using the DIGIT vision-based sensor with several objects, from the standard YCB model set. The results demonstrate that our approach estimates object poses that are compatible with actual object-sensor contacts in $87.5\%$ of cases while reaching an average positional error in the order of $2$ centimeters. Our analysis also includes qualitative results of experiments with a real DIGIT sensor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

The proposed method leverages an efficient 3D data augmentation and a novel vector-based decoupled rotation representation. Specifically, we first design an orientation-aware autoencoder with 3D graph convolution for latent feature learning. The learned latent feature is insensitive to point shift and size thanks to the shift and scale-invariance properties of the 3D graph convolution. Then, to efficiently decode the rotation information from the latent feature, we design a novel flexible vector-based decomposable rotation representation that employs two decoders to complementarily access the rotation information. The proposed rotation representation has two major advantages: 1) decoupled characteristic that makes the rotation estimation easier; 2) flexible length and rotated angle of the vectors allow us to find a more suitable vector representation for specific pose estimation task. Finally, we propose a 3D deformation mechanism to increase the generalization ability of the pipeline. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance on category-level tasks. Further, the experiments demonstrate that the proposed rotation representation is more suitable for the pose estimation tasks than other rotation representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>revis...</summary><p>revised from CVPR2021 paper FS-NET. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2103.07054</p></details> |
| **[MegaPose: 6D Pose Estimation of Novel Objects via Render & Compare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06870v1)** | 2022-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MegaPose, a method to estimate the 6D pose of novel objects, that is, objects unseen during training. At inference time, the method only assumes knowledge of (i) a region of interest displaying the object in the image and (ii) a CAD model of the observed object. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we present a 6D pose refiner based on a render&compare strategy which can be applied to novel objects. The shape and coordinate system of the novel object are provided as inputs to the network by rendering multiple synthetic views of the object's CAD model. Second, we introduce a novel approach for coarse pose estimation which leverages a network trained to classify whether the pose error between a synthetic rendering and an observed image of the same object can be corrected by the refiner. Third, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of photorealistic images of thousands of objects with diverse visual and shape properties and show that this diversity is crucial to obtain good generalization performance on novel objects. We train our approach on this large synthetic dataset and apply it without retraining to hundreds of novel objects in real images from several pose estimation benchmarks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ModelNet and YCB-Video datasets. An extensive evaluation on the 7 core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that our approach achieves performance competitive with existing approaches that require access to the target objects during training.

| **[Context-aware 6D Pose Estimation of Known Objects using RGB-D data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05560v1)** | 2022-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation has been a research topic in the field of computer vision and robotics. Many modern world applications like robot grasping, manipulation, autonomous navigation etc, require the correct pose of objects present in a scene to perform their specific task. It becomes even harder when the objects are placed in a cluttered scene and the level of occlusion is high. Prior works have tried to overcome this problem but could not achieve accuracy that can be considered reliable in real-world applications. In this paper, we present an architecture that, unlike prior work, is context-aware. It utilizes the context information available to us about the objects. Our proposed architecture treats the objects separately according to their types i.e; symmetric and non-symmetric. A deeper estimator and refiner network pair is used for non-symmetric objects as compared to symmetric due to their intrinsic differences. Our experiments show an enhancement in the accuracy of about 3.2% over the LineMOD dataset, which is considered a benchmark for pose estimation in the occluded and cluttered scenes, against the prior state-of-the-art DenseFusion. Our results also show that the inference time we got is sufficient for real-time usage.</p></details> |  |

| **[Toward Efficient Generalization in 3D Human Pose Estimation via a Canonical Domain Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16146v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning methods have significantly improved the performance of 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE). However, performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source and target domains remains a major challenge to generalization, necessitating extensive data augmentation and/or fine-tuning for each specific target domain. To address this issue more efficiently, we propose a novel canonical domain approach that maps both the source and target domains into a unified canonical domain, alleviating the need for additional fine-tuning in the target domain. To construct the canonical domain, we introduce a canonicalization process to generate a novel canonical 2D-3D pose mapping that ensures 2D-3D pose consistency and simplifies 2D-3D pose patterns, enabling more efficient training of lifting networks. The canonicalization of both domains is achieved through the following steps: (1) in the source domain, the lifting network is trained within the canonical domain; (2) in the target domain, input 2D poses are canonicalized prior to inference by leveraging the properties of perspective projection and known camera intrinsics. Consequently, the trained network can be directly applied to the target domain without requiring additional fine-tuning. Experiments conducted with various lifting networks and publicly available datasets (e.g., Human3.6M, Fit3D, MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves generalization capability across datasets while using the same data volume.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[NanoHTNet: Nano Human Topology Network for Efficient 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15763v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is limited by resource-constrained edge devices, requiring more efficient models. A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano. Code and models are available at https://github.com/vefalun/NanoHTNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpatioTemporal Learning for Human Pose Estimation in Sparsely-Labeled Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15073v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation in videos remains a challenge, largely due to the reliance on extensive manual annotation of large datasets, which is expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore, existing approaches often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and overlook the complementary relationship between temporal pose heatmaps and visual features. To address these limitations, we introduce STDPose, a novel framework that enhances human pose estimation by learning spatiotemporal dynamics in sparsely-labeled videos. STDPose incorporates two key innovations: 1) A novel Dynamic-Aware Mask to capture long-range motion context, allowing for a nuanced understanding of pose changes. 2) A system for encoding and aggregating spatiotemporal representations and motion dynamics to effectively model spatiotemporal relationships, improving the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. STDPose establishes a new performance benchmark for both video pose propagation (i.e., propagating pose annotations from labeled frames to unlabeled frames) and pose estimation tasks, across three large-scale evaluation datasets. Additionally, utilizing pseudo-labels generated by pose propagation, STDPose achieves competitive performance with only 26.7% labeled data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Human Pose Estimation Through Focused Human and Joint Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14439v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has given rise to a broad spectrum of novel and compelling applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, as well as surveillance. However, accurate video pose estimation remains an open challenge. One aspect that has been overlooked so far is that existing methods learn motion clues from all pixels rather than focusing on the target human body, making them easily misled and disrupted by unimportant information such as background changes or movements of other people. Additionally, while the current Transformer-based pose estimation methods has demonstrated impressive performance with global modeling, they struggle with local context perception and precise positional identification. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) We propose a bilayer Human-Keypoint Mask module that performs coarse-to-fine visual token refinement, which gradually zooms in on the target human body and keypoints while masking out unimportant figure regions. (2) We further introduce a novel deformable cross attention mechanism and a bidirectional separation strategy to adaptively aggregate spatial and temporal motion clues from constrained surrounding contexts. (3) We mathematically formulate the deformable cross attention, constraining that the model focuses solely on the regions centered at the target person body. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale benchmark datasets. A remarkable highlight is that our method achieves an 84.8 mean Average Precision (mAP) on the challenging wrist joint, which significantly outperforms the 81.5 mAP achieved by the current state-of-the-art method on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal-Inspired Multitask Learning for Video-Based Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14356v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based human pose estimation has long been a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer vision. Previous studies focus on spatio-temporal modeling through the enhancement of architecture design and optimization strategies. However, they overlook the causal relationships in the joints, leading to models that may be overly tailored and thus estimate poorly to challenging scenes. Therefore, adequate causal reasoning capability, coupled with good interpretability of model, are both indispensable and prerequisite for achieving reliable results. In this paper, we pioneer a causal perspective on pose estimation and introduce a causal-inspired multitask learning framework, consisting of two stages. \textit{In the first stage}, we try to endow the model with causal spatio-temporal modeling ability by introducing two self-supervision auxiliary tasks. Specifically, these auxiliary tasks enable the network to infer challenging keypoints based on observed keypoint information, thereby imbuing causal reasoning capabilities into the model and making it robust to challenging scenes. \textit{In the second stage}, we argue that not all feature tokens contribute equally to pose estimation. Prioritizing causal (keypoint-relevant) tokens is crucial to achieve reliable results, which could improve the interpretability of the model. To this end, we propose a Token Causal Importance Selection module to identify the causal tokens and non-causal tokens (\textit{e.g.}, background and objects). Additionally, non-causal tokens could provide potentially beneficial cues but may be redundant. We further introduce a non-causal tokens clustering module to merge the similar non-causal tokens. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

To address this we introduce BlanketGen2-Fit3D (BG2-Fit3D), an augmentation of Fit3D dataset that contains 1,217,312 frames with synthetic photo-realistic blankets. To generate it we used BlanketGen2, our new and improved version of our BlanketGen pipeline that simulates synthetic blankets using ground-truth Skinned Multi-Person Linear model (SMPL) meshes and then renders them as transparent images that can be layered on top of the original frames. This dataset was used in combination with the original Fit3D to finetune the ViTPose-B HPE model, to evaluate synthetic blanket augmentation effectiveness. The trained models were further evaluated on a real-world blanket occluded in-bed HPE dataset (SLP dataset). Comparing architectures trained on only Fit3D with the ones trained with our synthetic blanket augmentation the later improved pose estimation performance on BG2-Fit3D, the synthetic blanket occluded dataset significantly to (0.977 Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), 0.149 Normalized Mean Error (NME)) with an absolute 4.4% PCK increase. Furthermore, the test results on SLP demonstrated the utility of synthetic data augmentation by improving performance by an absolute 2.3% PCK, on real-world images with the poses occluded by real blankets. These results show synthetic blanket augmentation has the potential to improve in-bed blanket occluded HPE from RGB images. The dataset as well as the code will be made available to the public.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Towards Robust and Realistic Human Pose Estimation via WiFi Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09411v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust WiFi-based human pose estimation is a challenging task that bridges discrete and subtle WiFi signals to human skeletons. This paper revisits this problem and reveals two critical yet overlooked issues: 1) cross-domain gap, i.e., due to significant variations between source-target domain pose distributions; and 2) structural fidelity gap, i.e., predicted skeletal poses manifest distorted topology, usually with misplaced joints and disproportionate bone lengths. This paper fills these gaps by reformulating the task into a novel two-phase framework dubbed DT-Pose: Domain-consistent representation learning and Topology-constrained Pose decoding. Concretely, we first propose a temporal-consistent contrastive learning strategy with uniformity regularization, coupled with self-supervised masking-reconstruction operations, to enable robust learning of domain-consistent and motion-discriminative WiFi-specific representations. Beyond this, we introduce a simple yet effective pose decoder with task prompts, which integrates Graph Convolution Network (GCN) and Transformer layers to constrain the topology structure of the generated skeleton by exploring the adjacent-overarching relationships among human joints. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of our method in tackling these fundamental challenges in both 2D/3D human pose estimation tasks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[WorldPose: A World Cup Dataset for Global 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02771v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present WorldPose, a novel dataset for advancing research in multi-person global pose estimation in the wild, featuring footage from the 2022 FIFA World Cup. While previous datasets have primarily focused on local poses, often limited to a single person or in constrained, indoor settings, the infrastructure deployed for this sporting event allows access to multiple fixed and moving cameras in different stadiums. We exploit the static multi-view setup of HD cameras to recover the 3D player poses and motions with unprecedented accuracy given capture areas of more than 1.75 acres. We then leverage the captured players' motions and field markings to calibrate a moving broadcasting camera. The resulting dataset comprises more than 80 sequences with approx 2.5 million 3D poses and a total traveling distance of over 120 km. Subsequently, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the SOTA methods for global pose estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that WorldPose challenges existing multi-person techniques, supporting the potential for new research in this area and others, such as sports analysis. All pose annotations (in SMPL format), broadcasting camera parameters and footage will be released for academic research purposes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refinement Module based on Parse Graph of Feature Map for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11069v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parse graphs of the human body can be obtained in the human brain to help humans complete the human pose estimation (HPE). It contains a hierarchical structure, like a tree structure, and context relations among nodes. Many researchers pre-design the parse graph of body structure, and then design framework for HPE. However, these frameworks are difficulty adapting when encountering situations that differ from the preset human structure. Different from them, we regard the feature map as a whole, similarly to human body, so the feature map can be optimized based on parse graphs and each node feature is learned implicitly instead of explicitly, which means it can flexibly respond to different human body structure. In this paper, we design the Refinement Module based on the Parse Graph of feature map (RMPG), which includes two stages: top-down decomposition and bottom-up combination. In the top-down decomposition stage, the feature map is decomposed into multiple sub-feature maps along the channel and their context relations are calculated to obtain their respective context information. In the bottom-up combination stage, the sub-feature maps and their context information are combined to obtain refined sub-feature maps, and then these refined sub-feature maps are concatenated to obtain the refined feature map. Additionally ,we design a top-down framework by using multiple RMPG modules for HPE, some of which are supervised to obtain context relations among body parts. Our framework achieves excellent results on the COCO keypoint detection, CrowdPose and MPII human pose datasets. More importantly, our experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of RMPG on different methods, including SimpleBaselines, Hourglass, and ViTPose.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMPLest-X: Ultimate Scaling for Expressive Human Pose and Shape Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09782v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expressive human pose and shape estimation (EHPS) unifies body, hands, and face motion capture with numerous applications. Despite encouraging progress, current state-of-the-art methods focus on training innovative architectural designs on confined datasets. In this work, we investigate the impact of scaling up EHPS towards a family of generalist foundation models. 1) For data scaling, we perform a systematic investigation on 40 EHPS datasets, encompassing a wide range of scenarios that a model trained on any single dataset cannot handle. More importantly, capitalizing on insights obtained from the extensive benchmarking process, we optimize our training scheme and select datasets that lead to a significant leap in EHPS capabilities. Ultimately, we achieve diminishing returns at 10M training instances from diverse data sources. 2) For model scaling, we take advantage of vision transformers (up to ViT-Huge as the backbone) to study the scaling law of model sizes in EHPS. To exclude the influence of algorithmic design, we base our experiments on two minimalist architectures: SMPLer-X, which consists of an intermediate step for hand and face localization, and SMPLest-X, an even simpler version that reduces the network to its bare essentials and highlights significant advances in the capture of articulated hands. With big data and the large model, the foundation models exhibit strong performance across diverse test benchmarks and excellent transferability to even unseen environments. Moreover, our finetuning strategy turns the generalist into specialist models, allowing them to achieve further performance boosts. Notably, our foundation models consistently deliver state-of-the-art results on seven benchmarks such as AGORA, UBody, EgoBody, and our proposed SynHand dataset for comprehensive hand evaluation.

| **[A New Teacher-Reviewer-Student Framework for Semi-supervised 2D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09565v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional 2D human pose estimation methods typically require extensive labeled annotations, which are both labor-intensive and expensive. In contrast, semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation can alleviate the above problems by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data along with a small portion of labeled data. Existing semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation methods update the network through backpropagation, ignoring crucial historical information from the previous training process. Therefore, we propose a novel semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation method by utilizing a newly designed Teacher-Reviewer-Student framework. Specifically, we first mimic the phenomenon that human beings constantly review previous knowledge for consolidation to design our framework, in which the teacher predicts results to guide the student's learning and the reviewer stores important historical parameters to provide additional supervision signals. Secondly, we introduce a Multi-level Feature Learning strategy, which utilizes the outputs from different stages of the backbone to estimate the heatmap to guide network training, enriching the supervisory information while effectively capturing keypoint relationships. Finally, we design a data augmentation strategy, i.e., Keypoint-Mix, to perturb pose information by mixing different keypoints, thus enhancing the network's ability to discern keypoints. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, demonstrate our method achieves significant improvements compared to the existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Balanced Continual Multi-Modal Learning in Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05264v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) has emerged as a prominent research topic, particularly in the realm of RGB-based methods. However, RGB images are susceptible to limitations such as sensitivity to lighting conditions and potential user discomfort. Consequently, multi-modal sensing, which leverages non-intrusive sensors, is gaining increasing attention. Nevertheless, multi-modal 3D HPE still faces challenges, including modality imbalance and the imperative for continual learning. In this work, we introduce a novel balanced continual multi-modal learning method for 3D HPE, which harnesses the power of RGB, LiDAR, mmWave, and WiFi. Specifically, we propose a Shapley value-based contribution algorithm to quantify the contribution of each modality and identify modality imbalance. To address this imbalance, we employ a re-learning strategy. Furthermore, recognizing that raw data is prone to noise contamination, we develop a novel denoising continual learning approach. This approach incorporates a noise identification and separation module to mitigate the adverse effects of noise and collaborates with the balanced learning strategy to enhance optimization. Additionally, an adaptive EWC mechanism is employed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-adopted multi-modal dataset, MM-Fi, which demonstrate the superiority of our approach in boosting 3D pose estimation and mitigating catastrophic forgetting in complex scenarios. We will release our codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Pose-Constrained UV Map Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08815v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>UV map estimation is used in computer vision for detailed analysis of human posture or activity. Previous methods assign pixels to body model vertices by comparing pixel descriptors independently, without enforcing global coherence or plausibility in the UV map. We propose Pose-Constrained Continuous Surface Embeddings (PC-CSE), which integrates estimated 2D human pose into the pixel-to-vertex assignment process. The pose provides global anatomical constraints, ensuring that UV maps remain coherent while preserving local precision. Evaluation on DensePose COCO demonstrates consistent improvement, regardless of the chosen 2D human pose model. Whole-body poses offer better constraints by incorporating additional details about the hands and feet. Conditioning UV maps with human pose reduces invalid mappings and enhances anatomical plausibility. In addition, we highlight inconsistencies in the ground-truth annotations.</p></details> |  |

While single-frame pose estimation has seen significant progress, it often fails to capture the temporal dynamics for understanding complex, continuous movements. We propose Poseidon, a novel multi-frame pose estimation architecture that extends the ViTPose model by integrating temporal information for enhanced accuracy and robustness to address these limitations. Poseidon introduces key innovations: (1) an Adaptive Frame Weighting (AFW) mechanism that dynamically prioritises frames based on their relevance, ensuring that the model focuses on the most informative data; (2) a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) module that aggregates features from different backbone layers to capture both fine-grained details and high-level semantics; and (3) a Cross-Attention module for effective information exchange between central and contextual frames, enhancing the model's temporal coherence. The proposed architecture improves performance in complex video scenarios and offers scalability and computational efficiency suitable for real-world applications. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PoseTrack21 and PoseTrack18 datasets, achieving mAP scores of 88.3 and 87.8, respectively, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods do not operate well for testing images whose distribution is far from that of training data. This problem might be alleviated by involving diverse data during training, however it is non-trivial to collect such diverse data with corresponding labels (i.e. 3D pose). In this paper, we introduced an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 3D pose estimation that utilizes the unlabeled data in addition to labeled data via masked image modeling (MIM) framework. Foreground-centric reconstruction and attention regularization are further proposed to increase the effectiveness of unlabeled data usage. Experiments are conducted on the various datasets in human and hand pose estimation tasks, especially using the cross-domain scenario. We demonstrated the effectiveness of ours by achieving the state-of-the-art accuracy on all datasets.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing methods primarily emphasize the transfer of teacher knowledge while often neglecting the performance degradation resulted from the curse of capacity gap between teacher and student. To address this issue, we propose AgentPose, a novel pose distillation method that integrates a feature agent to model the distribution of teacher features and progressively aligns the distribution of student features with that of the teacher feature, effectively overcoming the capacity gap and enhancing the ability of knowledge transfer. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on the COCO dataset substantiate the effectiveness of our method in knowledge transfer, particularly in scenarios with a high capacity gap.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figures |

Current methods fail to provide high-quality representations due to reliance on pixel-level enhancements that compromise semantics and the inability to effectively handle extreme low-light conditions for robust feature learning. In this work, we propose a frequency-based framework for low-light human pose estimation, rooted in the "divide-and-conquer" principle. Instead of uniformly enhancing the entire image, our method focuses on task-relevant information. By applying dynamic illumination correction to the low-frequency components and low-rank denoising to the high-frequency components, we effectively enhance both the semantic and texture information essential for accurate pose estimation. As a result, this targeted enhancement method results in robust, high-quality representations, significantly improving pose estimation performance. Extensive experiments demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in various challenging low-light scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[BioPose: Biomechanically-accurate 3D Pose Estimation from Monocular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07800v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in 3D human pose estimation from single-camera images and videos have relied on parametric models, like SMPL. However, these models oversimplify anatomical structures, limiting their accuracy in capturing true joint locations and movements, which reduces their applicability in biomechanics, healthcare, and robotics. Biomechanically accurate pose estimation, on the other hand, typically requires costly marker-based motion capture systems and optimization techniques in specialized labs. To bridge this gap, we propose BioPose, a novel learning-based framework for predicting biomechanically accurate 3D human pose directly from monocular videos. BioPose includes three key components: a Multi-Query Human Mesh Recovery model (MQ-HMR), a Neural Inverse Kinematics (NeurIK) model, and a 2D-informed pose refinement technique. MQ-HMR leverages a multi-query deformable transformer to extract multi-scale fine-grained image features, enabling precise human mesh recovery. NeurIK treats the mesh vertices as virtual markers, applying a spatial-temporal network to regress biomechanically accurate 3D poses under anatomical constraints. To further improve 3D pose estimations, a 2D-informed refinement step optimizes the query tokens during inference by aligning the 3D structure with 2D pose observations. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that BioPose significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

They use an extra reference network or an additional image encoder to process multiple conditional image inputs, which adds complexity pre-processing and additional computational costs. Besides, they require more than 25 inference steps, bringing longer inference time. In this work, with the development of diffusion transformer (DiT), we rethink the necessity of additional reference network or image encoder and introduce MC-VTON, which leverages DiT's intrinsic backbone to seamlessly integrate minimal conditional try-on inputs. Compared to existing methods, the superiority of MC-VTON is demonstrated in four aspects: (1) Superior detail fidelity. Our DiT-based MC-VTON exhibits superior fidelity in preserving fine-grained details. (2) Simplified network and inputs. We remove any extra reference network or image encoder. We also remove unnecessary conditions like the long prompt, pose estimation, human parsing, and depth map. We require only the masked person image and the garment image. (3) Parameter-efficient training. To process the try-on task, we fine-tune the FLUX.1-dev with only 39.7M additional parameters (0.33% of the backbone parameters). (4) Less inference steps. We apply distillation diffusion on MC-VTON and only need 8 steps to generate a realistic try-on image, with only 86.8M additional parameters (0.72% of the backbone parameters). Experiments show that MC-VTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results with fewer condition inputs, trainable parameters, and inference steps than baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

However, using these datasets to evaluate dense geometry tasks, such as depth rendering, can be problematic as the meshes of the dataset are often incomplete and may produce wrong ground truth to evaluate the details. In this paper, we propose SCRREAM, a dataset annotation framework that allows annotation of fully dense meshes of objects in the scene and registers camera poses on the real image sequence, which can produce accurate ground truth for both sparse 3D as well as dense 3D tasks. We show the details of the dataset annotation pipeline and showcase four possible variants of datasets that can be obtained from our framework with example scenes, such as indoor reconstruction and SLAM, scene editing & object removal, human reconstruction and 6d pose estimation. Recent pipelines for indoor reconstruction and SLAM serve as new benchmarks. In contrast to previous indoor dataset, our design allows to evaluate dense geometry tasks on eleven sample scenes against accurately rendered ground truth depth maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Occlusion Resilient Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02773v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occlusions are a significant challenge to human pose estimation algorithms, often resulting in inaccurate and anatomically implausible poses. Although current occlusion-robust human pose estimation algorithms exhibit impressive performance on existing datasets, their success is largely attributed to supervised training and the availability of additional information, such as multiple views or temporal continuity. Furthermore, these algorithms typically suffer from performance degradation under distribution shifts. While existing domain adaptive human pose estimation algorithms address this bottleneck, they tend to perform suboptimally when the target domain images are occluded, a common occurrence in real-life scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OR-POSE: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Occlusion Resilient Human POSE Estimation. OR-POSE is an innovative unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm which effectively mitigates domain shifts and overcomes occlusion challenges by employing the mean teacher framework for iterative pseudo-label refinement. Additionally, OR-POSE reinforces realistic pose prediction by leveraging a learned human pose prior which incorporates the anatomical constraints of humans in the adaptation process. Lastly, OR-POSE avoids overfitting to inaccurate pseudo labels generated from heavily occluded images by employing a novel visibility-based curriculum learning approach. This enables the model to gradually transition from training samples with relatively less occlusion to more challenging, heavily occluded samples. Extensive experiments show that OR-POSE outperforms existing analogous state-of-the-art algorithms by $\sim$ 7% on challenging occluded human pose estimation datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

However, previous methods ignore the intricate dependence within the 2D pose sequence and learn single temporal correlation. To alleviate this limitation, we propose TCPFormer, which leverages an implicit pose proxy as an intermediate representation. Each proxy within the implicit pose proxy can build one temporal correlation therefore helping us learn more comprehensive temporal correlation of human motion. Specifically, our method consists of three key components: Proxy Update Module (PUM), Proxy Invocation Module (PIM), and Proxy Attention Module (PAM). PUM first uses pose features to update the implicit pose proxy, enabling it to store representative information from the pose sequence. PIM then invocates and integrates the pose proxy with the pose sequence to enhance the motion semantics of each pose. Finally, PAM leverages the above mapping between the pose sequence and pose proxy to enhance the temporal correlation of the whole pose sequence. Experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that our proposed TCPFormer outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by the 39th Annual AAAl Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAl 2025)</p></details> |

In addition to addressing the challenge of exploiting motion in unevenly sampled data, we combine stable diffusion to a hierarchical part representation which predicts the relative locations of fine-grained keypoints within each part (e.g., face) with respect to the part's local reference frame. On the H3WB dataset, our method greatly outperforms the current state of the art, which fails to exploit the temporal information. We also show considerable improvements compared to other spatiotemporal 3D human-pose estimation approaches that fail to account for the body part specificities.

| **[Frequency-aware Event Cloud Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20803v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are biologically inspired sensors that emit events asynchronously with remarkable temporal resolution, garnering significant attention from both industry and academia. Mainstream methods favor frame and voxel representations, which reach a satisfactory performance while introducing time-consuming transformation, bulky models, and sacrificing fine-grained temporal information. Alternatively, Point Cloud representation demonstrates promise in addressing the mentioned weaknesses, but it ignores the polarity information, and its models have limited proficiency in abstracting long-term events' features. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware network named FECNet that leverages Event Cloud representations. FECNet fully utilizes 2S-1T-1P Event Cloud by innovating the event-based Group and Sampling module. To accommodate the long sequence events from Event Cloud, FECNet embraces feature extraction in the frequency domain via the Fourier transform. This approach substantially extinguishes the explosion of Multiply Accumulate Operations (MACs) while effectively abstracting spatial-temporal features. We conducted extensive experiments on event-based object classification, action recognition, and human pose estimation tasks, and the results substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of FECNet.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Exploiting Aggregation and Segregation of Representations for Domain Adaptive Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20538v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation (HPE) has received increasing attention recently due to its wide application in motion analysis, virtual reality, healthcare, etc. However, it suffers from the lack of labeled diverse real-world datasets due to the time- and labor-intensive annotation. To cope with the label deficiency issue, one common solution is to train the HPE models with easily available synthetic datasets (source) and apply them to real-world data (target) through domain adaptation (DA). Unfortunately, prevailing domain adaptation techniques within the HPE domain remain predominantly fixated on effecting alignment and aggregation between source and target features, often sidestepping the crucial task of excluding domain-specific representations. To rectify this, we introduce a novel framework that capitalizes on both representation aggregation and segregation for domain adaptive human pose estimation. Within this framework, we address the network architecture aspect by disentangling representations into distinct domain-invariant and domain-specific components, facilitating aggregation of domain-invariant features while simultaneously segregating domain-specific ones. Moreover, we tackle the discrepancy measurement facet by delving into various keypoint relationships and applying separate aggregation or segregation mechanisms to enhance alignment. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, e.g., Human3.6M, LSP, H3D, and FreiHand, show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Optimizing Local-Global Dependencies for Accurate 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19676v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have recently achieved significant success in 3D human pose estimation, owing to their strong ability to model long-range dependencies. However, relying solely on the global attention mechanism is insufficient for capturing the fine-grained local details, which are crucial for accurate pose estimation. To address this, we propose SSR-STF, a dual-stream model that effectively integrates local features with global dependencies to enhance 3D human pose estimation. Specifically, we introduce SSRFormer, a simple yet effective module that employs the skeleton selective refine attention (SSRA) mechanism to capture fine-grained local dependencies in human pose sequences, complementing the global dependencies modeled by the Transformer. By adaptively fusing these two feature streams, SSR-STF can better learn the underlying structure of human poses, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods in local feature extraction. Extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that SSR-STF achieves state-of-the-art performance, with P1 errors of 37.4 mm and 13.2 mm respectively, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, the motion representations learned by our model prove effective in downstream tasks such as human mesh recovery.

| **[Humans as a Calibration Pattern: Dynamic 3D Scene Reconstruction from Unsynchronized and Uncalibrated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19089v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works on dynamic neural field reconstruction assume input from synchronized multi-view videos with known poses. These input constraints are often unmet in real-world setups, making the approach impractical. We demonstrate that unsynchronized videos with unknown poses can generate dynamic neural fields if the videos capture human motion. Humans are one of the most common dynamic subjects whose poses can be estimated using state-of-the-art methods. While noisy, the estimated human shape and pose parameters provide a decent initialization for the highly non-convex and under-constrained problem of training a consistent dynamic neural representation. Given the sequences of pose and shape of humans, we estimate the time offsets between videos, followed by camera pose estimations by analyzing 3D joint locations. Then, we train dynamic NeRF employing multiresolution rids while simultaneously refining both time offsets and camera poses. The setup still involves optimizing many parameters, therefore, we introduce a robust progressive learning strategy to stabilize the process. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate spatiotemporal calibration and high-quality scene reconstruction in challenging conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal-state Dynamics Estimation for Physics-based Human Motion Capture from Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07795v3)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion capture from monocular videos has made significant progress in recent years. However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g. in form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically plausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces and exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current state-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict torques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e. the joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical models, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end, we propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with the kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural Kalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to predict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a physics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to realize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and simulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show that this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps balancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important for not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing physically plausible human poses. The proposed approach excels in the physics-based human pose estimation task and demonstrates the physical plausibility of the predictive dynamics, compared to state of the art.

| **[Monkey Transfer Learning Can Improve Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15966v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we investigated whether transfer learning from macaque monkeys could improve human pose estimation. Current state-of-the-art pose estimation techniques, often employing deep neural networks, can match human annotation in non-clinical datasets. However, they underperform in novel situations, limiting their generalisability to clinical populations with pathological movement patterns. Clinical datasets are not widely available for AI training due to ethical challenges and a lack of data collection. We observe that data from other species may be able to bridge this gap by exposing the network to a broader range of motion cues. We found that utilising data from other species and undertaking transfer learning improved human pose estimation in terms of precision and recall compared to the benchmark, which was trained on humans only. Compared to the benchmark, fewer human training examples were needed for the transfer learning approach (1,000 vs 19,185). These results suggest that macaque pose estimation can improve human pose estimation in clinical situations. Future work should further explore the utility of pose estimation trained with monkey data in clinical populations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Anthropometric Measurements to Improve Human Mesh Estimation and Ensure Consistent Body Shapes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17671v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The basic body shape (i.e., the body shape in T-pose) of a person does not change within a single video. However, most SOTA human mesh estimation (HME) models output a slightly different, thus inconsistent basic body shape for each video frame. Furthermore, we find that SOTA 3D human pose estimation (HPE) models outperform HME models regarding the precision of the estimated 3D keypoint positions. We solve the problem of inconsistent body shapes by leveraging anthropometric measurements like taken by tailors from humans. We create a model called A2B that converts given anthropometric measurements to basic body shape parameters of human mesh models. We obtain superior and consistent human meshes by combining the A2B model results with the keypoints of 3D HPE models using inverse kinematics. We evaluate our approach on challenging datasets like ASPset or fit3D, where we can lower the MPJPE by over 30 mm compared to SOTA HME models. Further, replacing estimates of the body shape parameters from existing HME models with A2B results not only increases the performance of these HME models, but also guarantees consistent body shapes.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the noise and sparsity of LiDAR-captured point clouds, robust human pose estimation remains challenging. Most of the existing methods use temporal information, multi-modal fusion, or SMPL optimization to correct biased results. In this work, we try to obtain sufficient information for 3D HPE only by modeling the intrinsic properties of low-quality point clouds. Hence, a simple yet powerful method is proposed, which provides insights both on modeling and augmentation of point clouds. Specifically, we first propose a concise and effective density-aware pose transformer (DAPT) to get stable keypoint representations. By using a set of joint anchors and a carefully designed exchange module, valid information is extracted from point clouds with different densities. Then 1D heatmaps are utilized to represent the precise locations of the keypoints. Secondly, a comprehensive LiDAR human synthesis and augmentation method is proposed to pre-train the model, enabling it to acquire a better human body prior. We increase the diversity of point clouds by randomly sampling human positions and orientations and by simulating occlusions through the addition of laser-level masks. Extensive experiments have been conducted on multiple datasets, including IMU-annotated LidarHuman26M, SLOPER4D, and manually annotated Waymo Open Dataset v2.0 (Waymo), HumanM3. Our method demonstrates SOTA performance in all scenarios. In particular, compared with LPFormer on Waymo, we reduce the average MPJPE by $10.0mm$. Compared with PRN on SLOPER4D, we notably reduce the average MPJPE by $20.7mm$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs.

The downstream task is to assist rehabilitation by providing informative feedback to users while they are performing prescribed exercises. We utilize a contrastive learning strategy during training. Given a tuple of correctly and incorrectly executed exercises, our model is able to identify and highlight those joints that are involved in an incorrect movement and thus require the user's attention. We collected an in-house dataset, ExeCheck, with paired recordings of both correct and incorrect execution of exercises. In our experiments, we tested our method on this dataset as well as the UI-PRMD dataset and found ExeCheck outperformed the baseline method using pairwise sequence alignment in identifying joints of physical relevance in rehabilitation exercises.</p></details> |  |

To improve on top of prior work, we develop a method to generate and score multiple hypotheses during training, effectively integrating uncertainty quantification into the learning process. This process results in a deep uncertainty function that is trained end-to-end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned deep uncertainty model is used as the conformity score, which can be used to calibrate a conformal predictor in order to assess the quality of the output prediction. Since the data in human pose-shape learning is not fully exchangeable, we also present two practical bounds for the coverage gap in conformal prediction, developing theoretical backing for the uncertainty bound of our model. Our results indicate that by taking advantage of deep uncertainty with conformal prediction, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal prediction.</p></details> |  |

A key to successfully exploiting data scale is to design flexible models that can be supervised from various heterogeneous data sources produced by different researchers or vendors. To this end, we propose a simple yet powerful paradigm for seamlessly unifying different human pose and shape-related tasks and datasets. Our formulation is centered on the ability -- both at training and test time -- to query any arbitrary point of the human volume, and obtain its estimated location in 3D. We achieve this by learning a continuous neural field of body point localizer functions, each of which is a differently parameterized 3D heatmap-based convolutional point localizer (detector). For generating parametric output, we propose an efficient post-processing step for fitting SMPL-family body models to nonparametric joint and vertex predictions. With this approach, we can naturally exploit differently annotated data sources including mesh, 2D/3D skeleton and dense pose, without having to convert between them, and thereby train large-scale 3D human mesh and skeleton estimation models that considerably outperform the state-of-the-art on several public benchmarks including 3DPW, EMDB, EHF, SSP-3D and AGORA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

This approach leverages the advantages of normalizing flows in non-Euclidean geometries to address uncertain poses. Specifically, our method employs normalizing flow tailored to the SO(3) rotational group, incorporating a coupling mechanism based on the M\"obius transformation. This enables the framework to accurately represent any distribution on SO(3), effectively addressing issues related to discontinuities. Additionally, we reinterpret the challenge of reconstructing 3D human figures from 2D pixel-aligned inputs as the task of mapping these inputs to a range of probable poses. This perspective acknowledges the intrinsic ambiguity of the task and facilitates a straightforward integration method for multi-view scenarios. The combination of these strategies showcases the effectiveness of probabilistic models in complex scenarios for human pose estimation techniques. Our approach notably surpasses existing methods in the field of pose estimation. We also validate our methodology on human pose estimation from RGB images as well as medical X-Ray datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, a persistent and significant challenge within this field is the accurate prediction of human poses under conditions of severe occlusion. Traditional image-based estimators struggle with heavy occlusions due to a lack of temporal context, resulting in inconsistent predictions. While video-based models benefit from processing temporal data, they encounter limitations when faced with prolonged occlusions that extend over multiple frames. This challenge arises because these models struggle to generalize beyond their training datasets, and the variety of occlusions is hard to capture in the training data. Addressing these challenges, we propose STRIDE (Single-video based TempoRally contInuous Occlusion-Robust 3D Pose Estimation), a novel Test-Time Training (TTT) approach to fit a human motion prior for each video. This approach specifically handles occlusions that were not encountered during the model's training. By employing STRIDE, we can refine a sequence of noisy initial pose estimates into accurate, temporally coherent poses during test time, effectively overcoming the limitations of prior methods. Our framework demonstrates flexibility by being model-agnostic, allowing us to use any off-the-shelf 3D pose estimation method for improving robustness and temporal consistency. We validate STRIDE's efficacy through comprehensive experiments on challenging datasets like Occluded Human3.6M, Human3.6M, and OCMotion, where it not only outperforms existing single-image and video-based pose estimation models but also showcases superior handling of substantial occlusions, achieving fast, robust, accurate, and temporally consistent 3D pose estimates.

Addressing this need, our paper introduces EgoCast, a bimodal method for 3D human pose forecasting using egocentric videos and proprioceptive data. We study the task of human pose forecasting in a realistic setting, extending the boundaries of temporal forecasting in dynamic scenes and building on the current framework for current pose estimation in the wild. We introduce a current-frame estimation module that generates pseudo-groundtruth poses for inference, eliminating the need for past groundtruth poses typically required by current methods during forecasting. Our experimental results on the recent Ego-Exo4D and Aria Digital Twin datasets validate EgoCast for real-life motion estimation. On the Ego-Exo4D Body Pose 2024 Challenge, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, laying the groundwork for future research in human pose estimation and forecasting in unscripted activities with egocentric inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art models ignore out-of-image keypoints and use uncalibrated heatmaps as keypoint location representations. To address these limitations, we propose ProbPose, which predicts for each keypoint: a calibrated probability of keypoint presence at each location in the activation window, the probability of being outside of it, and its predicted visibility. To address the lack of evaluation protocols for out-of-image keypoints, we introduce the CropCOCO dataset and the Extended OKS (Ex-OKS) metric, which extends OKS to out-of-image points. Tested on COCO, CropCOCO, and OCHuman, ProbPose shows significant gains in out-of-image keypoint localization while also improving in-image localization through data augmentation. Additionally, the model improves robustness along the edges of the bounding box and offers better flexibility in keypoint evaluation.

This scenario poses a challenge in extracting and leveraging multi-scale features, which is often essential for precise inference. To address this challenge, we propose a new attention mechanism, named cascaded multi-scale attention (CMSA), tailored for use in CNN-ViT hybrid architectures, to handle low-resolution inputs effectively. The design of CMSA enables the extraction and seamless integration of features across various scales without necessitating the downsampling of the input image or feature maps. This is achieved through a novel combination of grouped multi-head self-attention mechanisms with window-based local attention and cascaded fusion of multi-scale features over different scales. This architecture allows for the effective handling of features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to perform tasks such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more with low-resolution images. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in these areas with fewer parameters, showcasing its potential for broad application in real-world scenarios where capturing high-resolution images is not feasible.

Recent work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation with detected bounding boxes or bottom-up-estimated poses. Unfortunately, all of these approaches overlooked segmentation masks and their connection to estimated keypoints. We condition pose estimation model by segmentation masks instead of bounding boxes to improve instance separation. This improves top-down pose estimation in multi-body scenarios but does not fix detection errors. Consequently, we develop BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP), integrating detection, segmentation and pose estimation into self-improving feedback loop. We adapt detector and pose estimation model for conditioning by instance masks and use Segment Anything as pose-to-mask model to close the circle. With only small models, BMP is superior to top-down methods on OCHuman dataset and to detector-free methods on COCO dataset, combining the best from both approaches and matching state of art performance in both settings.

Although CNN-based and Transformer-based methods have achieved breakthrough progress, they often fail to deliver superior performance and real-time speed. This paper introduces MamKPD, the first efficient yet effective mamba-based pose estimation framework for 2D keypoint detection. The conventional Mamba module exhibits limited information interaction between patches. To address this, we propose a lightweight contextual modeling module (CMM) that uses depth-wise convolutions to model inter-patch dependencies and linear layers to distill the pose cues within each patch. Subsequently, by combining Mamba for global modeling across all patches, MamKPD effectively extracts instances' pose information. We conduct extensive experiments on human and animal pose estimation datasets to validate the effectiveness of MamKPD. Our MamKPD-L achieves 77.3% AP on the COCO dataset with 1492 FPS on an NVIDIA GTX 4090 GPU. Moreover, MamKPD achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPII dataset and competitive results on the AP-10K dataset while saving 85% of the parameters compared to ViTPose.

We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, due to the depth ambiguity inherent to monocular 3D human pose estimation, traditional regression models suffer from pose-topology consistency issues, which standard evaluation metrics (MPJPE, P-MPJPE and PCK) fail to assess. ManiPose addresses depth ambiguity by proposing multiple candidate 3D poses for each 2D input, each with its estimated plausibility. Unlike previous multi-hypothesis approaches, ManiPose forgoes generative models, greatly facilitating its training and usage. By constraining the outputs to lie on the human pose manifold, ManiPose guarantees the consistency of all hypothetical poses, in contrast to previous works. We showcase the performance of ManiPose on real-world datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art models in pose consistency by a large margin while being very competitive on the MPJPE metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Recent probabilistic approaches learn a distribution over plausible 3D human meshes by maximizing the likelihood of the ground-truth pose given an image. We show that this objective function alone is not sufficient to best capture the full distributions. Instead, we propose to additionally supervise the learned distributions by minimizing the distance to distributions encoded in heatmaps of a 2D pose detector. Moreover, we reveal that current methods often generate incorrect hypotheses for invisible joints which is not detected by the evaluation protocols. We demonstrate that person segmentation masks can be utilized during training to significantly decrease the number of invalid samples and introduce two metrics to evaluate it. Our normalizing flow-based approach predicts plausible 3D human mesh hypotheses that are consistent with the image evidence while maintaining high diversity for ambiguous body parts. Experiments on 3DPW and EMDB show that we outperform other state-of-the-art probabilistic methods.

Sometimes, their motions are too subtle to be captured by the human eye. To analyze how they move to produce the music, we need to estimate precise 4D human pose (3D pose over time). However, current state-of-the-art (SoTA) visual pose estimation algorithms struggle to produce accurate monocular 4D poses because of occlusions, partial views, and human-object interactions. They are limited by the viewing angle, pixel density, and sampling rate of the cameras and fail to estimate fast and subtle movements, such as in the musical effect of vibrato. We leverage the direct causal relationship between the music produced and the human motions creating them to address these challenges. We propose VioPose: a novel multimodal network that hierarchically estimates dynamics. High-level features are cascaded to low-level features and integrated into Bayesian updates. Our architecture is shown to produce accurate pose sequences, facilitating precise motion analysis, and outperforms SoTA. As part of this work, we collected the largest and the most diverse calibrated violin-playing dataset, including video, sound, and 3D motion capture poses.

While previous studies have employed wearable sensor-based deep learning (DL) models for estimating joint kinematics, these methods often require extensive new datasets to adapt to unseen gait patterns. Meanwhile, researchers in computer vision have advanced human pose estimation models, which are easy to deploy and capable of real-time inference. However, such models are infeasible in scenarios where cameras cannot be used. To address these limitations, we propose a computer vision-based DL adaptation framework for real-time joint kinematic estimation. This framework requires only a small dataset (i.e., 1-2 gait cycles) and does not depend on professional motion capture setups. Using transfer learning, we adapted our temporal convolutional network (TCN) to stiff knee gait data, allowing the model to further reduce root mean square error by 9.7% and 19.9% compared to a TCN trained on only able-bodied and stiff knee datasets, respectively. Our framework demonstrates a potential for smartphone camera-trained DL models to estimate real-time joint kinematics across novel users in clinical populations with applications in wearable robots.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promise, current applications using RGB video data alone are limited in measuring clinically relevant spatial and temporal kinematics and establishing normative parameters essential for identifying movement abnormalities within a gait cycle. This paper presents a data-driven method using RGB video data and 2D human pose estimation for developing normative kinematic gait parameters. By analysing joint angles, an established kinematic measure in biomechanics and clinical practice, we aim to enhance gait analysis capabilities and improve explainability. Our cycle-wise kinematic analysis enables clinicians to simultaneously measure and compare multiple joint angles, assessing individuals against a normative population using just monocular RGB video. This approach expands clinical capacity, supports objective decision-making, and automates the identification of specific spatial and temporal deviations and abnormalities within the gait cycle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Human Understanding with Controllable Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08663v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training methods to perform robust 3D human pose and shape (HPS) estimation requires diverse training images with accurate ground truth. While BEDLAM demonstrates the potential of traditional procedural graphics to generate such data, the training images are clearly synthetic. In contrast, generative image models produce highly realistic images but without ground truth. Putting these methods together seems straightforward: use a generative model with the body ground truth as controlling signal. However, we find that, the more realistic the generated images, the more they deviate from the ground truth, making them inappropriate for training and evaluation. Enhancements of realistic details, such as clothing and facial expressions, can lead to subtle yet significant deviations from the ground truth, potentially misleading training models. We empirically verify that this misalignment causes the accuracy of HPS networks to decline when trained with generated images. To address this, we design a controllable synthesis method that effectively balances image realism with precise ground truth. We use this to create the Generative BEDLAM (Gen-B) dataset, which improves the realism of the existing synthetic BEDLAM dataset while preserving ground truth accuracy. We perform extensive experiments, with various noise-conditioning strategies, to evaluate the tradeoff between visual realism and HPS accuracy. We show, for the first time, that generative image models can be controlled by traditional graphics methods to produce training data that increases the accuracy of HPS methods.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of foundation models, we argue that a robust spatio-temporal motion prior can encapsulate underlying 3D dynamics applicable to various sensor modalities. We learn the rich motion prior from a sequence of complete parametric models of posed human body shape. Our prior can easily estimate poses in missing frames or noisy measurements despite significant occlusion by employing a temporal attention mechanism. More interestingly, our prior can guide the system with incomplete and challenging input measurements to quickly extract critical information to estimate the sequence of poses, significantly improving the training efficiency for mesh sequence recovery. ReMP consistently outperforms the baseline method on diverse and practical 3D motion data, including depth point clouds, LiDAR scans, and IMU sensor data.

The key to accuracy and robustness lies in high-quality training data. Existing training datasets containing real images with pseudo ground truth (pGT) use SMPLify to fit SMPL to sparse 2D joint locations, assuming a simplified camera with default intrinsics. We make two contributions that improve pGT accuracy. First, to estimate camera intrinsics, we develop a field-of-view prediction model (HumanFoV) trained on a dataset of images containing people. We use the estimated intrinsics to enhance the 4D-Humans dataset by incorporating a full perspective camera model during SMPLify fitting. Second, 2D joints provide limited constraints on 3D body shape, resulting in average-looking bodies. To address this, we use the BEDLAM dataset to train a dense surface keypoint detector. We apply this detector to the 4D-Humans dataset and modify SMPLify to fit the detected keypoints, resulting in significantly more realistic body shapes. Finally, we upgrade the HMR2.0 architecture to include the estimated camera parameters. We iterate model training and SMPLify fitting initialized with the previously trained model. This leads to more accurate pGT and a new model, CameraHMR, with state-of-the-art accuracy. Code and pGT are available for research purposes.</p></details> | 3DV 2025 |

By observing a user's arm movements, robots can respond appropriately, whether it's providing assistance or avoiding collisions. While visual perception offers potential for human pose estimation, it can be hindered by factors like poor lighting or occlusions. Additionally, wearable inertial sensors, though useful, require frequent calibration as they do not provide absolute position information. Force-myography (FMG) is an alternative approach where muscle perturbations are externally measured. It has been used to observe finger movements, but its application to full arm state estimation is unexplored. In this letter, we investigate the use of a wearable FMG device that can observe the state of the human arm for real-time applications of HRI. We propose a Transformer-based model to map FMG measurements from the shoulder of the user to the physical pose of the arm. The model is also shown to be transferable to other users with limited decline in accuracy. Through real-world experiments with a robotic arm, we demonstrate collision avoidance without relying on visual perception.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face challenges in handling complex movements, providing real-time feedback, and accommodating diverse postures, particularly with occlusions, rapid movements, and the resource constraints of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, making it difficult to balance accuracy and real-time performance. To address these issues, we propose GTA-Net, an intelligent system for posture correction and real-time feedback in adolescent sports, integrated within an IoT-enabled environment. This model enhances pose estimation in dynamic scenes by incorporating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and Hierarchical Attention mechanisms, achieving real-time correction through IoT devices. Experimental results show GTA-Net's superior performance on Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, with Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) values of 32.2mm, 15.0mm, and 48.0mm, respectively, significantly outperforming existing methods. The model also demonstrates strong robustness in complex scenarios, maintaining high accuracy even with occlusions and rapid movements. This system enhances real-time posture correction and offers broad applications in intelligent sports and health management.</p></details> | 18 pages |

The existing active acoustic sensing-based approach for 3D human pose estimation implicitly assumes that the target user is positioned along a line between loudspeakers and a microphone. Because reflection and diffraction of sound by the human body cause subtle acoustic signal changes compared to sound obstruction, the existing model degrades its accuracy significantly when subjects deviate from this line, limiting its practicality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method composed of a position discriminator and reverberation-resistant model. The former predicts the standing positions of subjects and applies adversarial learning to extract subject position-invariant features. The latter utilizes acoustic signals before the estimation target time as references to enhance robustness against the variations in sound arrival times due to diffraction and reflection. We construct an acoustic pose estimation dataset that covers diverse human locations and demonstrate through experiments that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches.</p></details> | Accepted at BMVC2024 |

Predicting future movement enables cameras to automatically track and predict a player's future trajectory without human intervention. Predicting future human movement in the context of complex physical tasks is also intellectually satisfying. Swift advancements in sports analytics and the wide availability of videos for tennis have inspired us to propose a novel method called Pose2Trajectory, which predicts a tennis player's future trajectory as a sequence derived from their body joints' data and ball position. Demonstrating impressive accuracy, our approach capitalizes on body joint information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human body's geometry and motion, thereby enhancing the prediction of the player's trajectory. We use encoder-decoder Transformer architecture trained on the joints and trajectory information of the players with ball positions. The predicted sequence can provide information to help close-up cameras to keep tracking the tennis player, following centroid coordinates. We generate a high-quality dataset from multiple videos to assist tennis player movement prediction using object detection and human pose estimation methods. It contains bounding boxes and joint information for tennis players and ball positions in singles tennis games. Our method shows promising results in predicting the tennis player's movement trajectory with different sequence prediction lengths using the joints and trajectory information with the ball position.</p></details> |  |

At the heart of RopeTP is a hierarchical attention mechanism that significantly improves context awareness, which is essential for accurately inferring the posture of occluded body parts.

The improved robustness of these local estimations allows for the reconstruction of precise and stable global trajectories. Additionally, RopeTP incorporates a diffusion trajectory model that predicts realistic human motion from local pose sequences.

Extensive experimental validation shows that RopeTP surpasses current methods on two benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with occlusions. It also outperforms methods that rely on SLAM for initial camera estimates and extensive optimization, delivering more accurate and realistic trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025 (Round 1)</p></details> |

Most existing methods focus on restoring high-resolution feature maps by stacking multiple costly deconvolutional layers or by continuously aggregating semantic information from low-resolution feature maps while maintaining high-resolution ones, which can lead to information redundancy. Additionally, due to quantization errors, heatmap-based methods have certain disadvantages in accurately locating keypoints of medium and small-scale human figures. In this paper, we propose HRPVT, which utilizes PVT v2 as the backbone to model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we introduce the High-Resolution Pyramid Module (HRPM), designed to generate higher quality high-resolution representations by incorporating the intrinsic inductive biases of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into the high-resolution feature maps. The integration of HRPM enhances the performance of pure transformer-based models for human pose estimation at medium and small scales. Furthermore, we replace the heatmap-based method with SimCC approach, which eliminates the need for costly upsampling layers, thereby allowing us to allocate more computational resources to HRPM. To accommodate models with varying parameter scales, we have developed two insertion strategies of HRPM, each designed to enhancing the model's ability to perceive medium and small-scale human poses from two distinct perspectives.</p></details> | under review |

To achieve this, we introduce a large-scale dataset named RefHuman, which substantially extends the MS COCO dataset with additional text and positional prompt annotations. RefHuman includes over 50,000 annotated instances in the wild, each equipped with keypoint, mask, and prompt annotations. To enable prompt-conditioned estimation, we propose the first end-to-end promptable approach named UniPHD for R-HPM. UniPHD extracts multimodal representations and employs a proposed pose-centric hierarchical decoder to process (text or positional) instance queries and keypoint queries, producing results specific to the referred person. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniPHD produces quality results based on user-friendly prompts and achieves top-tier performance on RefHuman val and MS COCO val2017.

This area remains relatively unexplored due to the lack of large-scale datasets. Recent datasets focusing on this issue mainly consist of activities captured entirely in controlled indoor environments with choreographed actions, significantly affecting their diversity. To address this, we introduce Harmony4D, a multi-view video dataset for human-human interaction featuring in-the-wild activities such as wrestling, dancing, MMA, and more. We use a flexible multi-view capture system to record these dynamic activities and provide annotations for human detection, tracking, 2D/3D pose estimation, and mesh recovery for closely interacting subjects. We propose a novel markerless algorithm to track 3D human poses in severe occlusion and close interaction to obtain our annotations with minimal manual intervention. Harmony4D consists of 1.66 million images and 3.32 million human instances from more than 20 synchronized cameras with 208 video sequences spanning diverse environments and 24 unique subjects. We rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art methods for mesh recovery and highlight their significant limitations in modeling close interaction scenarios. Additionally, we fine-tune a pre-trained HMR2.0 model on Harmony4D and demonstrate an improved performance of 54.8% PVE in scenes with severe occlusion and contact.

| **[Efficient Neural Implicit Representation for 3D Human Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17741v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity digital human representations are increasingly in demand in the digital world, particularly for interactive telepresence, AR/VR, 3D graphics, and the rapidly evolving metaverse. Even though they work well in small spaces, conventional methods for reconstructing 3D human motion frequently require the use of expensive hardware and have high processing costs. This study presents HumanAvatar, an innovative approach that efficiently reconstructs precise human avatars from monocular video sources. At the core of our methodology, we integrate the pre-trained HuMoR, a model celebrated for its proficiency in human motion estimation. This is adeptly fused with the cutting-edge neural radiance field technology, Instant-NGP, and the state-of-the-art articulated model, Fast-SNARF, to enhance the reconstruction fidelity and speed. By combining these two technologies, a system is created that can render quickly and effectively while also providing estimation of human pose parameters that are unmatched in accuracy. We have enhanced our system with an advanced posture-sensitive space reduction technique, which optimally balances rendering quality with computational efficiency. In our detailed experimental analysis using both artificial and real-world monocular videos, we establish the advanced performance of our approach. HumanAvatar consistently equals or surpasses contemporary leading-edge reconstruction techniques in quality. Furthermore, it achieves these complex reconstructions in minutes, a fraction of the time typically required by existing methods. Our models achieve a training speed that is 110X faster than that of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) NeRF-based models. Our technique performs noticeably better than SoTA dynamic human NeRF methods if given an identical runtime limit. HumanAvatar can provide effective visuals after only 30 seconds of training.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARTS: Semi-Analytical Regressor using Disentangled Skeletal Representations for Human Mesh Recovery from Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15582v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods have made significant progress, simultaneously estimating human pose and shape from low-resolution image features limits their performance. These image features lack sufficient spatial information about the human body and contain various noises (e.g., background, lighting, and clothing), which often results in inaccurate pose and inconsistent motion. Inspired by the rapid advance in human pose estimation, we discover that compared to image features, skeletons inherently contain accurate human pose and motion. Therefore, we propose a novel semiAnalytical Regressor using disenTangled Skeletal representations for human mesh recovery from videos, called ARTS. Specifically, a skeleton estimation and disentanglement module is proposed to estimate the 3D skeletons from a video and decouple them into disentangled skeletal representations (i.e., joint position, bone length, and human motion). Then, to fully utilize these representations, we introduce a semi-analytical regressor to estimate the parameters of the human mesh model. The regressor consists of three modules: Temporal Inverse Kinematics (TIK), Bone-guided Shape Fitting (BSF), and Motion-Centric Refinement (MCR). TIK utilizes joint position to estimate initial pose parameters and BSF leverages bone length to regress bone-aligned shape parameters. Finally, MCR combines human motion representation with image features to refine the initial human model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ARTS surpasses existing state-of-the-art video-based methods in both per-frame accuracy and temporal consistency on popular benchmarks: 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M.

SignDiff has a novel Frame Reinforcement Network called FR-Net, similar to dense human pose estimation work, which enhances the correspondence between text lexical symbols and sign language dense pose frames, reduces the occurrence of multiple fingers in the diffusion model. In addition, we propose a new method for American Sign Language Production (ASLP), which can generate ASL skeletal pose videos from text input, integrating two new improved modules and a new loss function to improve the accuracy and quality of sign language skeletal posture and enhance the ability of the model to train on large-scale data. We propose the first baseline for ASL production and report the scores of 17.19 and 12.85 on BLEU-4 on the How2Sign dev/test sets. We evaluated our model on the previous mainstream dataset PHOENIX14T, and our method achieved the SOTA results.

| **[Multi-modal Pose Diffuser: A Multimodal Generative Conditional Pose Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14540v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model plays a crucial role in 3D human pose estimation, providing a streamlined yet effective representation of the human body. However, ensuring the validity of SMPL configurations during tasks such as human mesh regression remains a significant challenge , highlighting the necessity for a robust human pose prior capable of discerning realistic human poses. To address this, we introduce MOPED: \underline{M}ulti-m\underline{O}dal \underline{P}os\underline{E} \underline{D}iffuser. MOPED is the first method to leverage a novel multi-modal conditional diffusion model as a prior for SMPL pose parameters. Our method offers powerful unconditional pose generation with the ability to condition on multi-modal inputs such as images and text. This capability enhances the applicability of our approach by incorporating additional context often overlooked in traditional pose priors. Extensive experiments across three distinct tasks-pose estimation, pose denoising, and pose completion-demonstrate that our multi-modal diffusion model-based prior significantly outperforms existing methods. These results indicate that our model captures a broader spectrum of plausible human poses.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-Fi: A Modality-Invariant Foundation Model for Multimodal Human Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10167v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human sensing, which employs various sensors and advanced deep learning technologies to accurately capture and interpret human body information, has significantly impacted fields like public security and robotics. However, current human sensing primarily depends on modalities such as cameras and LiDAR, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Furthermore, existing multi-modal fusion solutions are typically designed for fixed modality combinations, requiring extensive retraining when modalities are added or removed for diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modality-invariant foundation model for all modalities, X-Fi, to address this issue. X-Fi enables the independent or combinatory use of sensor modalities without additional training by utilizing a transformer structure to accommodate variable input sizes and incorporating a novel "X-fusion" mechanism to preserve modality-specific features during multimodal integration. This approach not only enhances adaptability but also facilitates the learning of complementary features across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets, employing six distinct modalities, demonstrate that X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation (HPE) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. The findings indicate that our proposed model can efficiently support a wide range of human sensing applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution of scalable, multimodal sensing technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, current WiFi-based pose estimation methods are predominantly evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions with sophisticated vision models to acquire accurately labeled data. Furthermore, WiFi CSI is highly sensitive to environmental variables, and direct application of a pre-trained model to a new environment may yield suboptimal results due to domain shift. In this paper, we proposes a domain adaptation algorithm, AdaPose, designed specifically for weakly-supervised WiFi-based pose estimation. The proposed method aims to identify consistent human poses that are highly resistant to environmental dynamics. To achieve this goal, we introduce a Mapping Consistency Loss that aligns the domain discrepancy of source and target domains based on inner consistency between input and output at the mapping level. We conduct extensive experiments on domain adaptation in two different scenes using our self-collected pose estimation dataset containing WiFi CSI frames. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of AdaPose in eliminating domain shift, thereby facilitating the widespread application of WiFi-based pose estimation in smart cities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Occluded Human Pose Estimation based on Limb Joint Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09885v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation aims at locating the specific joints of humans from the images or videos. While existing deep learning-based methods have achieved high positioning accuracy, they often struggle with generalization in occlusion scenarios. In this paper, we propose an occluded human pose estimation framework based on limb joint augmentation to enhance the generalization ability of the pose estimation model on the occluded human bodies. Specifically, the occlusion blocks are at first employed to randomly cover the limb joints of the human bodies from the training images, imitating the scene where the objects or other people partially occlude the human body. Trained by the augmented samples, the pose estimation model is encouraged to accurately locate the occluded keypoints based on the visible ones. To further enhance the localization ability of the model, this paper constructs a dynamic structure loss function based on limb graphs to explore the distribution of occluded joints by evaluating the dependence between adjacent joints. Extensive experimental evaluations on two occluded datasets, OCHuman and CrowdPose, demonstrate significant performance improvements without additional computation cost during inference.</p></details> | Accept by NCAA |

Despite significant improvements brought by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), these models suffer performance declines when trained with discontinuous video frames, which is a frequent scenario in real-world settings. This decline primarily results from the loss of temporal continuity, which is crucial for understanding the semantics of human actions. To overcome this issue, we introduce the 4A (Action Animation-based Augmentation Approach) pipeline, which employs a series of sophisticated techniques: starting with 2D human pose estimation from RGB videos, followed by Quaternion-based Graph Convolution Network for joint orientation and trajectory prediction, and Dynamic Skeletal Interpolation for creating smoother, diversified actions using game engine technology. This innovative approach generates realistic animations in varied game environments, viewed from multiple viewpoints. In this way, our method effectively bridges the domain gap between virtual and real-world data. In experimental evaluations, the 4A pipeline achieves comparable or even superior performance to traditional training approaches using real-world data, while requiring only 10% of the original data volume. Additionally, our approach demonstrates enhanced performance on In-the-wild videos, marking a significant advancement in the field of action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI24, model and code are available at https://github.com/xingyu-song/4A</p></details> |
| **[Quater-GCN: Enhancing 3D Human Pose Estimation with Orientation and Semi-supervised Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19279v3)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D human pose estimation is a vital task in computer vision, involving the prediction of human joint positions from images or videos to reconstruct a skeleton of a human in three-dimensional space. This technology is pivotal in various fields, including animation, security, human-computer interaction, and automotive safety, where it promotes both technological progress and enhanced human well-being. The advent of deep learning significantly advances the performance of 3D pose estimation by incorporating temporal information for predicting the spatial positions of human joints. However, traditional methods often fall short as they primarily focus on the spatial coordinates of joints and overlook the orientation and rotation of the connecting bones, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of human pose in 3D space. To address these limitations, we introduce Quater-GCN (Q-GCN), a directed graph convolutional network tailored to enhance pose estimation by orientation. Q-GCN excels by not only capturing the spatial dependencies among node joints through their coordinates but also integrating the dynamic context of bone rotations in 2D space. This approach enables a more sophisticated representation of human poses by also regressing the orientation of each bone in 3D space, moving beyond mere coordinate prediction. Furthermore, we complement our model with a semi-supervised training strategy that leverages unlabeled data, addressing the challenge of limited orientation ground truth data. Through comprehensive evaluations, Q-GCN has demonstrated outstanding performance against current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI24, model and code are available at https://github.com/xingyu-song/q_gcn</p></details> |
| **[Invisibility Cloak: Disappearance under Human Pose Estimation via Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07670v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Pose Estimation (HPE) has been widely applied in autonomous systems such as self-driving cars. However, the potential risks of HPE to adversarial attacks have not received comparable attention with image classification or segmentation tasks. Existing works on HPE robustness focus on misleading an HPE system to provide wrong predictions that still indicate some human poses. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of HPE systems to disappearance attacks, where the attacker aims to subtly alter the HPE training process via backdoor techniques so that any input image with some specific trigger will not be recognized as involving any human pose. As humans are typically at the center of HPE systems, such attacks can induce severe security hazards, e.g., pedestrians' lives will be threatened if a self-driving car incorrectly understands the front scene due to disappearance attacks. To achieve the adversarial goal of disappearance, we propose IntC, a general framework to craft Invisibility Cloak in the HPE domain. The core of our work lies in the design of target HPE labels that do not represent any human pose. In particular, we propose three specific backdoor attacks based on our IntC framework with different label designs. IntC-S and IntC-E, respectively designed for regression- and heatmap-based HPE techniques, concentrate the keypoints of triggered images in a tiny, imperceptible region. Further, to improve the attack's stealthiness, IntC-L designs the target poisons to capture the label outputs of typical landscape images without a human involved, achieving disappearance and reducing detectability simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our IntC methods in achieving the disappearance goal. By revealing the vulnerability of HPE to disappearance and backdoor attacks, we hope our work can raise awareness of the potential risks ...</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Active Measurement for Human Mesh Recovery in Close Proximity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08116v5)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For physical human-robot interactions (pHRI), a robot needs to estimate the accurate body pose of a target person. However, in these pHRI scenarios, the robot cannot fully observe the target person's body with equipped cameras because the target person must be close to the robot for physical interaction. This close distance leads to severe truncation and occlusions and thus results in poor accuracy of human pose estimation. For better accuracy in this challenging environment, we propose an active measurement and sensor fusion framework of the equipped cameras with touch and ranging sensors such as 2D LiDAR. Touch and ranging sensor measurements are sparse but reliable and informative cues for localizing human body parts. In our active measurement process, camera viewpoints and sensor placements are dynamically optimized to measure body parts with higher estimation uncertainty, which is closely related to truncation or occlusion. In our sensor fusion process, assuming that the measurements of touch and ranging sensors are more reliable than the camera-based estimations, we fuse the sensor measurements to the camera-based estimated pose by aligning the estimated pose towards the measured points. Our proposed method outperformed previous methods on the standard occlusion benchmark with simulated active measurement. Furthermore, our method reliably estimated human poses using a real robot, even with practical constraints such as occlusion by blankets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) on Sep 2024</p></details> |

Recent works use larger models with transformer backbones and decoders to improve the accuracy in human pose and shape (HPS) benchmarks. D-PoSE proposes a vision based approach that uses the estimated human depth-maps as an intermediate representation for HPS and leverages training with synthetic data and the ground-truth depth-maps provided with them for depth supervision during training. Although trained on synthetic datasets, D-PoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real-world benchmark datasets, EMDB and 3DPW. Despite its simple lightweight design and the CNN backbone, it outperforms ViT-based models that have a number of parameters that is larger by almost an order of magnitude.

To improve efficiency, lightweight modules are proposed to replace costly point-wise convolutions in high-resolution networks, including channel weighting and spatial weighting methods. However, they fail to maintain the consistency of weights and capture global spatial information. To address these problems, we present a Grouped lightweight High-Resolution Network (Greit-HRNet), in which we propose a Greit block including a group method Grouped Channel Weighting (GCW) and a spatial weighting method Global Spatial Weighting (GSW). GCW modules group conditional channel weighting to make weights stable and maintain the high-resolution features with the deepening of the network, while GSW modules effectively extract global spatial information and exchange information across channels. In addition, we apply the Large Kernel Attention (LKA) method to improve the whole efficiency of our Greit-HRNet. Our experiments on both MS-COCO and MPII human pose estimation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our Greit-HRNet, outperforming other state-of-the-art lightweight networks.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

Prior research has made progress by harnessing spatial and temporal cues to infer 3D poses from 2D joint observations. This paper introduces a Dual Transformer Fusion (DTF) algorithm, a novel approach to obtain a holistic 3D pose estimation, even in the presence of severe occlusions. Confronting the issue of occlusion-induced missing joint data, we propose a temporal interpolation-based occlusion guidance mechanism. To enable precise 3D Human Pose Estimation, our approach leverages the innovative DTF architecture, which first generates a pair of intermediate views. Each intermediate-view undergoes spatial refinement through a self-refinement schema. Subsequently, these intermediate-views are fused to yield the final 3D human pose estimation. The entire system is end-to-end trainable. Through extensive experiments conducted on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, our method's performance is rigorously evaluated. Notably, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on both datasets, yielding substantial improvements.

In this work, we introduce the challenge of unsupervised prior learning in pose estimation, where AI models learn pose priors of animate objects from videos in a self-supervised manner. These videos present objects performing various actions, providing crucial information about their keypoints and connectivity. While priors are effective in pose estimation, acquiring them can be difficult. We propose a novel method, named Pose Prior Learner (PPL), to learn general pose priors applicable to any object category. PPL uses a hierarchical memory to store compositional parts of prototypical poses, from which we distill a general pose prior. This prior enhances pose estimation accuracy through template transformation and image reconstruction. PPL learns meaningful pose priors without any additional human annotations or interventions, outperforming competitive baselines on both human and animal pose estimation datasets. Notably, our experimental results reveal the effectiveness of PPL using learnt priors for pose estimation on occluded images. Through iterative inference, PPL leverages priors to refine estimated poses, regressing them to any prototypical poses stored in memory. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, Mamba's performance on dense prediction tasks, including human pose estimation and semantic segmentation, has been constrained by three key challenges: insufficient inductive bias, long-range forgetting, and low-resolution output representation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Dynamic Visual State Space (DVSS) block, which utilizes multi-scale convolutional kernels to extract local features across different scales and enhance inductive bias, and employs deformable convolution to mitigate the long-range forgetting problem while enabling adaptive spatial aggregation based on input and task-specific information. By leveraging the multi-resolution parallel design proposed in HRNet, we introduce High-Resolution Visual State Space Model (HRVMamba) based on the DVSS block, which preserves high-resolution representations throughout the entire process while promoting effective multi-scale feature learning. Extensive experiments highlight HRVMamba's impressive performance on dense prediction tasks, achieving competitive results against existing benchmark models without bells and whistles.

The acquisition of 3D data, while invaluable for resolving pose ambiguity, is expensive and requires an intricate setup, often restricting its applicability to controlled lab environments. We improve performance of monocular human pose estimation models using multiview data for fine-tuning. We propose a novel loss function, multiview consistency, to enable adding additional training data with only 2D supervision. This loss enforces that the inferred 3D pose from one view aligns with the inferred 3D pose from another view under similarity transformations. Our consistency loss substantially improves performance for fine-tuning with no available 3D data. Our experiments demonstrate that two views offset by 90 degrees are enough to obtain good performance, with only marginal improvements by adding more views. Thus, we enable the acquisition of domain-specific data by capturing activities with off-the-shelf cameras, eliminating the need for elaborate calibration procedures. This research introduces new possibilities for domain adaptation in 3D pose estimation, providing a practical and cost-effective solution to customize models for specific applications. The used dataset, featuring additional views, will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel data generation method that utilizes Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to annotate contact maps which guide test-time optimization to produce paired image and pseudo-ground truth meshes. This methodology not only alleviates the annotation burden but also enables the assembly of a comprehensive dataset specifically tailored for close interactions in HME. Our Ask Pose Unite (APU) dataset, comprising over 6.2k human mesh pairs in contact covering diverse interaction types, is curated from images depicting naturalistic person-to-person scenes. We empirically show that using our dataset to train a diffusion-based contact prior, used as guidance during optimization, improves mesh estimation on unseen interactions. Our work addresses longstanding challenges of data scarcity for close interactions in HME enhancing the field's capabilities of handling complex interaction scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://laubravo.github.io/apu_website/</p></details> |

We benchmark this formulation against established regularization-based methods for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, including EWC, LFL, and LwF. Moreover, we propose a novel regularization method called Importance-Weighted Distillation (IWD), which enhances conventional LwF by introducing a layer-wise distillation penalty and dynamic temperature adjustment based on layer importance for previously learned knowledge. This allows for a controlled adaptation to new tasks that respects the stability-plasticity balance critical in continual learning. Through extensive experiments across three datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing regularization-based continual learning strategies. IWD shows an average improvement of 3.60\% over the state-of-the-art LwF method. The results highlight the potential of our method to serve as a robust framework for real-world applications where models must evolve with new data without forgetting past knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed mentor-student relationships, our framework dynamically selects and adapts the teaching strategies of diverse mentors based on their effectiveness for each data sample. ClassroomKD comprises two main modules: the Knowledge Filtering (KF) Module and the Mentoring Module. The KF Module dynamically ranks mentors based on their performance for each input, activating only high-quality mentors to minimize error accumulation and prevent information loss. The Mentoring Module adjusts the distillation strategy by tuning each mentor's influence according to the performance gap between the student and mentors, effectively modulating the learning pace. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and 2D human pose estimation (COCO Keypoints and MPII Human Pose) demonstrate that ClassroomKD significantly outperforms existing knowledge distillation methods. Our results highlight that a dynamic and adaptive approach to mentor selection and guidance leads to more effective knowledge transfer, paving the way for enhanced model performance through distillation.</p></details> |  |

Although traditional cameras are commonly applied, their reliability decreases in scenarios under high dynamic range or heavy motion blur, where event cameras offer a robust solution. Predominant event-based methods accumulate events into frames, ignoring the asynchronous and high temporal resolution that is crucial for distinguishing distinct actions. To address this issue and to unlock the 3D potential of event information, we introduce two 3D event representations: the Rasterized Event Point Cloud (RasEPC) and the Decoupled Event Voxel (DEV). The RasEPC aggregates events within concise temporal slices at identical positions, preserving their 3D attributes along with statistical information, thereby significantly reducing memory and computational demands. Meanwhile, the DEV representation discretizes events into voxels and projects them across three orthogonal planes, utilizing decoupled event attention to retrieve 3D cues from the 2D planes. Furthermore, we develop and release EV-3DPW, a synthetic event-based dataset crafted to facilitate training and quantitative analysis in outdoor scenes. Our methods are tested on the DHP19 public dataset, MMHPSD dataset, and our EV-3DPW dataset, with further qualitative validation via a derived driving scene dataset EV-JAAD and an outdoor collection vehicle.

However, existing MLP models are not good at capturing local details and lack prior knowledge of human body configurations, which limits their modeling power for skeletal representation learning. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective graph-reinforced MLP-Like architecture, named GraphMLP, that combines MLPs and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in a global-local-graphical unified architecture for 3D human pose estimation. GraphMLP incorporates the graph structure of human bodies into an MLP model to meet the domain-specific demand of the 3D human pose, while allowing for both local and global spatial interactions. Furthermore, we propose to flexibly and efficiently extend the GraphMLP to the video domain and show that complex temporal dynamics can be effectively modeled in a simple way with negligible computational cost gains in the sequence length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MLP-Like architecture for 3D human pose estimation in a single frame and a video sequence. Extensive experiments show that the proposed GraphMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.

| **[Bilateral Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Flatter Minima](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13173v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) enhances generalization by reducing a Max-Sharpness (MaxS). Despite the practical success, we empirically found that the MAxS behind SAM's generalization enhancements face the "Flatness Indicator Problem" (FIP), where SAM only considers the flatness in the direction of gradient ascent, resulting in a next minimization region that is not sufficiently flat. A better Flatness Indicator (FI) would bring a better generalization of neural networks. Because SAM is a greedy search method in nature. In this paper, we propose to utilize the difference between the training loss and the minimum loss over the neighborhood surrounding the current weight, which we denote as Min-Sharpness (MinS). By merging MaxS and MinS, we created a better FI that indicates a flatter direction during the optimization. Specially, we combine this FI with SAM into the proposed Bilateral SAM (BSAM) which finds a more flatter minimum than that of SAM. The theoretical analysis proves that BSAM converges to local minima. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSAM offers superior generalization performance and robustness compared to vanilla SAM across various tasks, i.e., classification, transfer learning, human pose estimation, and network quantization. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ajiaaa/BSAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth-based Privileged Information for Boosting 3D Human Pose Estimation on RGB](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11104v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advances in computer vision research, estimating the 3D human pose from single RGB images remains a challenging task, as multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D projection on the image. In this context, depth data could help to disambiguate the 2D information by providing additional constraints about the distance between objects in the scene and the camera. Unfortunately, the acquisition of accurate depth data is limited to indoor spaces and usually is tied to specific depth technologies and devices, thus limiting generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a method able to leverage the benefits of depth information without compromising its broader applicability and adaptability in a predominantly RGB-camera-centric landscape. Our approach consists of a heatmap-based 3D pose estimator that, leveraging the paradigm of Privileged Information, is able to hallucinate depth information from the RGB frames given at inference time. More precisely, depth information is used exclusively during training by enforcing our RGB-based hallucination network to learn similar features to a backbone pre-trained only on depth data. This approach proves to be effective even when dealing with limited and small datasets. Experimental results reveal that the paradigm of Privileged Information significantly enhances the model's performance, enabling efficient extraction of depth information by using only RGB images.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 Workshop T-CAP: TOWARDS A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF PEOPLE: FINE-GRAINED UNDERSTANDING FOR REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS</p></details> |

While current models show promising results, they are typically trained and tested on clean data, potentially overlooking the corruption during real-world deployment and thus posing safety risks in practical scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce PoseBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of pose estimation models against real-world corruption. We evaluated 60 representative models, including top-down, bottom-up, heatmap-based, regression-based, and classification-based methods, across three datasets for human and animal pose estimation. Our evaluation involves 10 types of corruption in four categories: 1) blur and noise, 2) compression and color loss, 3) severe lighting, and 4) masks. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art models are vulnerable to common real-world corruptions and exhibit distinct behaviors when tackling human and animal pose estimation tasks. To improve model robustness, we delve into various design considerations, including input resolution, pre-training datasets, backbone capacity, post-processing, and data augmentations. We hope that our benchmark will serve as a foundation for advancing research in robust pose estimation.

Currently, most on-going rover missions utilize ground-in-the-loop interventions to manually correct for drift in the pose estimate and this human supervision bottlenecks the distance over which rovers can operate autonomously and carry out scientific measurements. In this paper, we present ShadowNav, an autonomous approach for global localization on the Moon with an emphasis on driving in darkness and at nighttime. Our approach uses the leading edge of Lunar craters as landmarks and a particle filtering approach is used to associate detected craters with known ones on an offboard map. We discuss the key design decisions in developing the ShadowNav framework for use with a Lunar rover concept equipped with a stereo camera and an external illumination source. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in both a Lunar simulation environment and on data collected during a field test at Cinder Lakes, Arizona.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for IEEE Transactions on Field Robotics (T-FR)</p></details> |

The main challenge lies in the ambiguity of defining the world coordinate system, which varies between sequences. Previous approaches attempt to alleviate this issue by predicting relative motion in an autoregressive manner, but are prone to accumulating errors. Instead, we propose estimating human poses in a novel Gravity-View (GV) coordinate system, which is defined by the world gravity and the camera view direction. The proposed GV system is naturally gravity-aligned and uniquely defined for each video frame, largely reducing the ambiguity of learning image-pose mapping. The estimated poses can be transformed back to the world coordinate system using camera rotations, forming a global motion sequence. Additionally, the per-frame estimation avoids error accumulation in the autoregressive methods. Experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers more realistic motion in both the camera space and world-grounded settings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed.

However, due to the prohibitive cost of motion capture, existing datasets are often limited in scale and diversity. In this work, we obtain massive human sequences by playing the video game with automatically annotated 3D ground truths. Specifically, we contribute GTA-Human, a large-scale 3D human dataset generated with the GTA-V game engine, featuring a highly diverse set of subjects, actions, and scenarios. More importantly, we study the use of game-playing data and obtain five major insights. First, game-playing data is surprisingly effective. A simple frame-based baseline trained on GTA-Human outperforms more sophisticated methods by a large margin. For video-based methods, GTA-Human is even on par with the in-domain training set. Second, we discover that synthetic data provides critical complements to the real data that is typically collected indoor. Our investigation into domain gap provides explanations for our data mixture strategies that are simple yet useful. Third, the scale of the dataset matters. The performance boost is closely related to the additional data available. A systematic study reveals the model sensitivity to data density from multiple key aspects. Fourth, the effectiveness of GTA-Human is also attributed to the rich collection of strong supervision labels (SMPL parameters), which are otherwise expensive to acquire in real datasets. Fifth, the benefits of synthetic data extend to larger models such as deeper convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, for which a significant impact is also observed. We hope our work could pave the way for scaling up 3D human recovery to the real world.

| **[SPiKE: 3D Human Pose from Point Cloud Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01879v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is the task of locating keypoints of the human body in 3D space from 2D or 3D representations such as RGB images, depth maps or point clouds. Current HPE methods from depth and point clouds predominantly rely on single-frame estimation and do not exploit temporal information from sequences. This paper presents SPiKE, a novel approach to 3D HPE using point cloud sequences. Unlike existing methods that process frames of a sequence independently, SPiKE leverages temporal context by adopting a Transformer architecture to encode spatio-temporal relationships between points across the sequence. By partitioning the point cloud into local volumes and using spatial feature extraction via point spatial convolution, SPiKE ensures efficient processing by the Transformer while preserving spatial integrity per timestamp. Experiments on the ITOP benchmark for 3D HPE show that SPiKE reaches 89.19% mAP, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower inference times. Extensive ablations further validate the effectiveness of sequence exploitation and our algorithmic choices.

However, deploying HPE algorithms in surveillance contexts raises significant privacy concerns due to the potential leakage of sensitive personal information (SPI) such as facial features, and ethnicity. Existing privacy-enhancing methods often compromise either privacy or performance, or they require costly additional modalities. We propose a novel privacy-enhancing system that generates privacy-enhanced portraits while maintaining high HPE performance. Our key innovations include the reversible recovery of SPI for authorized personnel and the preservation of contextual information. By jointly optimizing a privacy-enhancing module, a privacy recovery module, and a pose estimator, our system ensures robust privacy protection, efficient SPI recovery, and high-performance HPE. Experimental results demonstrate the system's robust performance in privacy enhancement, SPI recovery, and HPE.</p></details> |  |
| **[ActionPose: Pretraining 3D Human Pose Estimation with the Dark Knowledge of Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00449v1)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>2D-to-3D human pose lifting is an ill-posed problem due to depth ambiguity and occlusion. Existing methods relying on spatial and temporal consistency alone are insufficient to resolve these problems because they lack semantic information of the motions. To overcome this, we propose ActionPose, a framework that leverages action knowledge by aligning motion embeddings with text embeddings of fine-grained action labels. ActionPose operates in two stages: pretraining and fine-tuning. In the pretraining stage, the model learns to recognize actions and reconstruct 3D poses from masked and noisy 2D poses. During the fine-tuning stage, the model is further refined using real-world 3D human pose estimation datasets without action labels. Additionally, our framework incorporates masked body parts and masked time windows in motion modeling to mitigate the effects of ambiguous boundaries between actions in both temporal and spatial domains. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ActionPose, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 3D pose estimation on public datasets, including Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Specifically, ActionPose achieves an MPJPE of 36.7mm on Human3.6M with detected 2D poses as input and 15.5mm on MPI-INF-3DHP with ground-truth 2D poses as input.</p></details> |  |
| **[GMFL-Net: A Global Multi-geometric Feature Learning Network for Repetitive Action Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00330v1)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous development of deep learning, the field of repetitive action counting is gradually gaining notice from many researchers. Extraction of pose keypoints using human pose estimation networks is proven to be an effective pose-level method. However, existing pose-level methods suffer from the shortcomings that the single coordinate is not stable enough to handle action distortions due to changes in camera viewpoints, thus failing to accurately identify salient poses, and is vulnerable to misdetection during the transition from the exception to the actual action. To overcome these problems, we propose a simple but efficient Global Multi-geometric Feature Learning Network (GMFL-Net). Specifically, we design a MIA-Module that aims to improve information representation by fusing multi-geometric features, and learning the semantic similarity among the input multi-geometric features. Then, to improve the feature representation from a global perspective, we also design a GBFL-Module that enhances the inter-dependencies between point-wise and channel-wise elements and combines them with the rich local information generated by the MIA-Module to synthesise a comprehensive and most representative global feature representation. In addition, considering the insufficient existing dataset, we collect a new dataset called Countix-Fitness-pose (https://github.com/Wantong66/Countix-Fitness) which contains different cycle lengths and exceptions, a test set with longer duration, and annotate it with fine-grained annotations at the pose-level. We also add two new action classes, namely lunge and rope push-down. Finally, extensive experiments on the challenging RepCount-pose, UCFRep-pose, and Countix-Fitness-pose benchmarks show that our proposed GMFL-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Most methods rely solely on either egocentric-view images or sparse Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) signals, leading to inaccuracies due to self-occlusion in images or the sparseness and drift of inertial sensors. Most importantly, the lack of real-world datasets containing both modalities is a major obstacle to progress in this field. To overcome the barrier, we propose EMHI, a multimodal \textbf{E}gocentric human \textbf{M}otion dataset with \textbf{H}ead-Mounted Display (HMD) and body-worn \textbf{I}MUs, with all data collected under the real VR product suite. Specifically, EMHI provides synchronized stereo images from downward-sloping cameras on the headset and IMU data from body-worn sensors, along with pose annotations in SMPL format. This dataset consists of 885 sequences captured by 58 subjects performing 39 actions, totaling about 28.5 hours of recording. We evaluate the annotations by comparing them with optical marker-based SMPL fitting results. To substantiate the reliability of our dataset, we introduce MEPoser, a new baseline method for multimodal egocentric HPE, which employs a multimodal fusion encoder, temporal feature encoder, and MLP-based regression heads. The experiments on EMHI show that MEPoser outperforms existing single-modal methods and demonstrates the value of our dataset in solving the problem of egocentric HPE. We believe the release of EMHI and the method could advance the research of egocentric HPE and expedite the practical implementation of this technology in VR/AR products.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces several challenges, including Gaussian redundancy, limited ability to capture view-dependent effects, and difficulties in handling complex lighting and specular reflections. Additionally, methods that use spherical harmonics for color representation often struggle to effectively capture specular highlights and anisotropic components, especially when modeling view-dependent colors under complex lighting conditions, leading to insufficient contrast and unnatural color saturation. To address these limitations, we introduce PEP-GS, a perceptually-enhanced framework that dynamically predicts Gaussian attributes, including opacity, color, and covariance. We replace traditional spherical harmonics with a Hierarchical Granular-Structural Attention mechanism, which enables more accurate modeling of complex view-dependent color effects and specular highlights. By employing a stable and interpretable framework for opacity and covariance estimation, PEP-GS avoids the removal of essential Gaussians prematurely, ensuring a more accurate scene representation. Furthermore, perceptual optimization is applied to the final rendered images, enhancing perceptual consistency across different views and ensuring high-quality renderings with improved texture fidelity and fine-scale detail preservation. Experimental results demonstrate that PEP-GS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving view-dependent effects, specular reflections, and fine-scale details.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DGS$^2$: Near Second-order Converging 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13975v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream solution for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. By explicitly encoding a 3D scene using a collection of Gaussian kernels, 3DGS achieves high-quality rendering with superior efficiency. As a learning-based approach, 3DGS training has been dealt with the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which offers at most linear convergence. Consequently, training often requires tens of minutes, even with GPU acceleration. This paper introduces a (near) second-order convergent training algorithm for 3DGS, leveraging its unique properties. Our approach is inspired by two key observations. First, the attributes of a Gaussian kernel contribute independently to the image-space loss, which endorses isolated and local optimization algorithms. We exploit this by splitting the optimization at the level of individual kernel attributes, analytically constructing small-size Newton systems for each parameter group, and efficiently solving these systems on GPU threads. This achieves Newton-like convergence per training image without relying on the global Hessian. Second, kernels exhibit sparse and structured coupling across input images. This property allows us to effectively utilize spatial information to mitigate overshoot during stochastic training. Our method converges an order faster than standard GPU-based 3DGS training, requiring over $10\times$ fewer iterations while maintaining or surpassing the quality of the compared with the SGD-based 3DGS reconstructions.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Despite their impressive performance, they confront challenges due to the limitation of structure-from-motion (SfM) methods on acquiring accurate scene initialization, or the inefficiency of densification strategy. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework EasySplat to achieve high-quality 3DGS modeling. Instead of using SfM for scene initialization, we employ a novel method to release the power of large-scale pointmap approaches. Specifically, we propose an efficient grouping strategy based on view similarity, and use robust pointmap priors to obtain high-quality point clouds and camera poses for 3D scene initialization. After obtaining a reliable scene structure, we propose a novel densification approach that adaptively splits Gaussian primitives based on the average shape of neighboring Gaussian ellipsoids, utilizing KNN scheme. In this way, the proposed method tackles the limitation on initialization and optimization, leading to an efficient and accurate 3DGS modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasySplat outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in handling novel view synthesis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5figures |

However, 3DGS training requires a known camera pose for each input view, typically obtained by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Pioneering works have attempted to relax this restriction but still face difficulties when handling long sequences with complex camera trajectories. In this work, we propose Rob-GS, a robust framework to progressively estimate camera poses and optimize 3DGS for arbitrarily long video sequences. Leveraging the inherent continuity of videos, we design an adjacent pose tracking method to ensure stable pose estimation between consecutive frames. To handle arbitrarily long inputs, we adopt a "divide and conquer" scheme that adaptively splits the video sequence into several segments and optimizes them separately. Extensive experiments on the Tanks and Temples dataset and our collected real-world dataset show that our Rob-GS outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically require monocular videos or calibrated multi-view images as inputs, whose applicability could be weakened in real-world scenarios with arbitrary and/or unknown camera poses. In this paper, we aim to generate the set of 3DGS attributes via a diffusion-based framework conditioned on human priors extracted from a single image. Specifically, we begin with carefully integrated human-centric feature extraction procedures to deduce informative conditioning signals. Based on our empirical observations that jointly learning the whole 3DGS attributes is challenging to optimize, we design a multi-stage generation strategy to obtain different types of 3DGS attributes. To facilitate the training process, we investigate constructing proxy ground-truth 3D Gaussian attributes as high-quality attribute-level supervision signals. Through extensive experiments, our HuGDiffusion shows significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, GS-based reconstructions generally consist of millions of Gaussians, which makes them hard to use on computationally constrained devices such as smartphones. In this paper, we first propose a principled analysis of advances in efficient GS methods. Then, we propose Trick-GS, which is a careful combination of several strategies including (1) progressive training with resolution, noise and Gaussian scales, (2) learning to prune and mask primitives and SH bands by their significance, and (3) accelerated GS training framework. Trick-GS takes a large step towards resource-constrained GS, where faster run-time, smaller and faster-convergence of models is of paramount concern. Our results on three datasets show that Trick-GS achieves up to 2x faster training, 40x smaller disk size and 2x faster rendering speed compared to vanilla GS, while having comparable accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP'25</p></details> |

However, efficient real-time map reconstruction with data streamed from multiple robots and devices remains a challenge. To that end, we propose HAMMER, a server-based collaborative Gaussian Splatting method that leverages widely available ROS communication infrastructure to generate 3D, metric-semantic maps from asynchronous robot data-streams with no prior knowledge of initial robot positions and varying on-device pose estimators. HAMMER consists of (i) a frame alignment module that transforms local SLAM poses and image data into a global frame and requires no prior relative pose knowledge, and (ii) an online module for training semantic 3DGS maps from streaming data. HAMMER handles mixed perception modes, adjusts automatically for variations in image pre-processing among different devices, and distills CLIP semantic codes into the 3D scene for open-vocabulary language queries. In our real-world experiments, HAMMER creates higher-fidelity maps (2x) compared to competing baselines and is useful for downstream tasks, such as semantic goal-conditioned navigation (e.g., ``go to the couch").

| **[3DGSR: Implicit Surface Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00409v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an implicit surface reconstruction method with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), namely 3DGSR, that allows for accurate 3D reconstruction with intricate details while inheriting the high efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. The key insight is incorporating an implicit signed distance field (SDF) within 3D Gaussians to enable them to be aligned and jointly optimized. First, we introduce a differentiable SDF-to-opacity transformation function that converts SDF values into corresponding Gaussians' opacities. This function connects the SDF and 3D Gaussians, allowing for unified optimization and enforcing surface constraints on the 3D Gaussians. During learning, optimizing the 3D Gaussians provides supervisory signals for SDF learning, enabling the reconstruction of intricate details. However, this only provides sparse supervisory signals to the SDF at locations occupied by Gaussians, which is insufficient for learning a continuous SDF. Then, to address this limitation, we incorporate volumetric rendering and align the rendered geometric attributes (depth, normal) with those derived from 3D Gaussians. This consistency regularization introduces supervisory signals to locations not covered by discrete 3D Gaussians, effectively eliminating redundant surfaces outside the Gaussian sampling range. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our 3DGSR method enables high-quality 3D surface reconstruction while preserving the efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. Besides, our method competes favorably with leading surface reconstruction techniques while offering a more efficient learning process and much better rendering qualities. The code will be available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/3DGSR.</p></details> |  |

However, it typically requires large storage capacity and high VRAM, demanding the design of effective pruning and compression techniques. Existing methods, while effective in some scenarios, struggle with scalability and fail to adapt models based on critical factors such as computing capabilities or bandwidth, requiring to re-train the model under different configurations. In this work, we propose a novel, model-agnostic technique that organizes Gaussians into several hierarchical layers, enabling progressive Level of Detail (LoD) strategy. This method, combined with recent approach of compression of 3DGS, allows a single model to instantly scale across several compression ratios, with minimal to none impact to quality compared to a single non-scalable model and without requiring re-training. We validate our approach on typical datasets and benchmarks, showcasing low distortion and substantial gains in terms of scalability and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose MultiDreamer3D that can generate coherent multi-concept 3D content in a divide-and-conquer manner. First, we generate 3D bounding boxes using an LLM-based layout controller. Next, a selective point cloud generator creates coarse point clouds for each concept. These point clouds are placed in the 3D bounding boxes and initialized into 3D Gaussian Splatting with concept labels, enabling precise identification of concept attributions in 2D projections. Finally, we refine 3D Gaussians via concept-aware interval score matching, guided by concept-aware diffusion. Our experimental results show that MultiDreamer3D not only ensures object presence and preserves the distinct identities of each concept but also successfully handles complex cases such as property change or interaction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the multi-concept customization in 3D.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled precise 3D mapping and scene understanding by rendering photo-realistic images. However, existing 3DGS methods often struggle to accurately reconstruct a 3D map that reflects the actual scale and geometry of the real world, which degrades localization performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS method called Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GeomGS). This method fully integrates LiDAR data into 3D Gaussian primitives via a probabilistic approach, as opposed to approaches that only use LiDAR as initial points or introduce simple constraints for Gaussian points. To this end, we introduce a Geometric Confidence Score (GCS), which identifies the structural reliability of each Gaussian point. The GCS is optimized simultaneously with Gaussians under probabilistic distance constraints to construct a precise structure. Furthermore, we propose a novel localization method that fully utilizes both the geometric and photometric properties of GeomGS. Our GeomGS demonstrates state-of-the-art geometric and localization performance across several benchmarks, while also improving photometric performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

While these approaches can build highly realistic maps, large-scale SLAM still remains a challenge because they require a large number of Gaussian images for mapping and adjacent images as keyframes for tracking. We propose a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method, VIGS SLAM, that utilizes sensor fusion of RGB-D and IMU sensors for large-scale indoor environments. To reduce the computational load of 3DGS-based tracking, we adopt an ICP-based tracking framework that combines IMU preintegration to provide a good initial guess for accurate pose estimation. Our proposed method is the first to propose that Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM can be effectively performed in large-scale environments by integrating IMU sensor measurements. This proposal not only enhances the performance of Gaussian Splatting SLAM beyond room-scale scenarios but also achieves SLAM performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in large-scale indoor environments.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Motion blur is prevalent in real-world dynamic video capture, especially due to human movements in 3D human avatar modeling. Existing methods either (1) assume sharp image inputs, failing to address the detail loss introduced by motion blur, or (2) mainly consider blur by camera movements, neglecting the human motion blur which is more common in animatable avatars. Our proposed approach integrates a human movement-based motion blur model into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly modeling human motion trajectories during exposure time, we jointly optimize the trajectories and 3D Gaussians to reconstruct sharp, high-quality human avatars. We employ a pose-dependent fusion mechanism to distinguish moving body regions, optimizing both blurred and sharp areas effectively. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Deblur-Avatar significantly outperforms existing methods in rendering quality and quantitative metrics, producing sharp avatar reconstructions and enabling real-time rendering under challenging motion blur conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, its high storage requirements pose significant challenges for practical applications. We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics that are analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- Like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features like edges and contours; While other Gaussians represent broader, smoother regions, that are analogous to broader brush strokes that add volume and depth to a painting. Based on this observation, we propose a novel hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which define scene boundaries, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover smooth regions. Sketch Gaussians are efficiently encoded using parametric models, leveraging their geometric coherence, while Patch Gaussians undergo optimized pruning, retraining, and vector quantization to maintain volumetric consistency and storage efficiency. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrates that this structure-aware approach achieves up to 32.62% improvement in PSNR, 19.12% in SSIM, and 45.41% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes, and correspondingly, for an indoor scene, our model maintains the visual quality with 2.3% of the original model size.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore using 2D Gaussian splats as a new primitive for representing videos. We propose GSVC, an approach to learning a set of 2D Gaussian splats that can effectively represent and compress video frames. GSVC incorporates the following techniques: (i) To exploit temporal redundancy among adjacent frames, which can speed up training and improve the compression efficiency, we predict the Gaussian splats of a frame based on its previous frame; (ii) To control the trade-offs between file size and quality, we remove Gaussian splats with low contribution to the video quality; (iii) To capture dynamics in videos, we randomly add Gaussian splats to fit content with large motion or newly-appeared objects; (iv) To handle significant changes in the scene, we detect key frames based on loss differences during the learning process. Experiment results show that GSVC achieves good rate-distortion trade-offs, comparable to state-of-the-art video codecs such as AV1 and VVC, and a rendering speed of 1500 fps for a 1920x1080 video.</p></details> |  |

However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To achieve a compact size, we propose HAC++, which leverages the relationships between unorganized anchors and a structured hash grid, utilizing their mutual information for context modeling. Additionally, HAC++ captures intra-anchor contextual relationships to further enhance compression performance. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to precisely estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Moreover, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Overall, HAC++ achieves a remarkable size reduction of over 100X compared to vanilla 3DGS when averaged on all datasets, while simultaneously improving fidelity. It also delivers more than 20X size reduction compared to Scaffold-GS.

However, its splatting-based rendering model makes several approximations to the rendering equation, reducing physical accuracy. We show that splatting and its approximations are unnecessary, even within a rasterizer; we instead volumetrically integrate 3D Gaussians directly to compute the transmittance across them analytically. We use this analytic transmittance to derive more physically-accurate alpha values than 3DGS, which can directly be used within their framework. The result is a method that more closely follows the volume rendering equation (similar to ray-tracing) while enjoying the speed benefits of rasterization. Our method represents opaque surfaces with higher accuracy and fewer points than 3DGS. This enables it to outperform 3DGS for view synthesis (measured in SSIM and LPIPS). Being volumetrically consistent also enables our method to work out of the box for tomography. We match the state-of-the-art 3DGS-based tomography method with fewer points.</p></details> |  |

These methods commonly resort to using exponential family functions, such as the Gaussian function, as reconstruction kernels due to their anisotropic nature, ease of projection, and differentiability in rasterization. However, the field remains restricted to variations within the exponential family, leaving generalized reconstruction kernels largely underexplored, partly due to the lack of easy integrability in 3D to 2D projections. In this light, we show that a class of decaying anisotropic radial basis functions (DARBFs), which are non-negative functions of the Mahalanobis distance, supports splatting by approximating the Gaussian function's closed-form integration advantage. With this fresh perspective, we demonstrate up to 34% faster convergence during training and a 15% reduction in memory consumption across various DARB reconstruction kernels, while maintaining comparable PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS results. We will make the code available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link ...</summary><p>Link to the project page: https://randomnerds.github.io/darbs.github.io/</p></details> |

However, in foggy scenes, scattering and attenuation can significantly degrade the reconstruction and rendering quality. Although NeRF-based dehazing reconstruction algorithms have been developed, their use of deep fully connected neural networks and per-ray sampling strategies leads to high computational costs. Moreover, NeRF's implicit representation struggles to recover fine details from hazy scenes. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction by explicitly modeling point clouds into 3D Gaussians. In this paper, we propose leveraging the explicit Gaussian representation to explain the foggy image formation process through a physically accurate forward rendering process. We introduce DehazeGS, a method capable of decomposing and rendering a fog-free background from participating media using only muti-view foggy images as input. We model the transmission within each Gaussian distribution to simulate the formation of fog. During this process, we jointly learn the atmospheric light and scattering coefficient while optimizing the Gaussian representation of the hazy scene. In the inference stage, we eliminate the effects of scattering and attenuation on the Gaussians and directly project them onto a 2D plane to obtain a clear view. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world foggy datasets demonstrate that DehazeGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both rendering quality and computational efficiency. visualizations are available at https://dehazegs.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,4 figures. visualizations are available at https://dehazegs.github.io/</p></details> |

Recent works have extended these approaches to support surface reconstruction and tracking. However, tracking dynamic surfaces with 3D Gaussians remains challenging due to complex topology changes, such as surfaces appearing, disappearing, or splitting. To address these challenges, we propose GSTAR, a novel method that achieves photo-realistic rendering, accurate surface reconstruction, and reliable 3D tracking for general dynamic scenes with changing topology. Given multi-view captures as input, GSTAR binds Gaussians to mesh faces to represent dynamic objects. For surfaces with consistent topology, GSTAR maintains the mesh topology and tracks the meshes using Gaussians. In regions where topology changes, GSTAR adaptively unbinds Gaussians from the mesh, enabling accurate registration and the generation of new surfaces based on these optimized Gaussians. Additionally, we introduce a surface-based scene flow method that provides robust initialization for tracking between frames. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively tracks and reconstructs dynamic surfaces, enabling a range of applications.

While advanced techniques like radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve rendering quality and impressive efficiency with dense view inputs, they suffer from significant geometric reconstruction errors when applied to sparse input views. Moreover, although recent methods leverage monocular depth estimation to enhance geometric learning, their dependence on single-view estimated depth often leads to view inconsistency issues across different viewpoints. Consequently, this reliance on absolute depth can introduce inaccuracies in geometric information, ultimately compromising the quality of scene reconstruction with Gaussian splats. In this paper, we present RDG-GS, a novel sparse-view 3D rendering framework with Relative Depth Guidance based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. The core innovation lies in utilizing relative depth guidance to refine the Gaussian field, steering it towards view-consistent spatial geometric representations, thereby enabling the reconstruction of accurate geometric structures and capturing intricate textures. First, we devise refined depth priors to rectify the coarse estimated depth and insert global and fine-grained scene information to regular Gaussians. Building on this, to address spatial geometric inaccuracies from absolute depth, we propose relative depth guidance by optimizing the similarity between spatially correlated patches of depth and images. Additionally, we also directly deal with the sparse areas challenging to converge by the adaptive sampling for quick densification. Across extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF360, LLFF, DTU, and Blender, RDG-GS demonstrates state-of-the-art rendering quality and efficiency, making a significant advancement for real-world application.</p></details> | 24 pages, 12 figures |

However, the 3D Gaussians learned by 3D-GS have ambiguous structures without any geometry constraints. This inherent issue in 3D-GS leads to a rough boundary when segmenting individual objects. To remedy these problems, we propose SAGD, a conceptually simple yet effective boundary-enhanced segmentation pipeline for 3D-GS to improve segmentation accuracy while preserving segmentation speed. Specifically, we introduce a Gaussian Decomposition scheme, which ingeniously utilizes the special structure of 3D Gaussian, finds out, and then decomposes the boundary Gaussians. Moreover, to achieve fast interactive 3D segmentation, we introduce a novel training-free pipeline by lifting a 2D foundation model to 3D-GS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality 3D segmentation without rough boundary issues, which can be easily applied to other scene editing tasks.</p></details> |  |

These variations can lead to floaters and color distortions in the rendered images/videos. Recent appearance modeling approaches in Gaussian Splatting are either tightly coupled with the rendering process, hindering real-time rendering, or they only account for mild global variations, performing poorly in scenes with local light changes. In this paper, we propose DAVIGS, a method that decouples appearance variations in a plug-and-play and efficient manner. By transforming the rendering results at the image level instead of the Gaussian level, our approach can model appearance variations with minimal optimization time and memory overhead. Furthermore, our method gathers appearance-related information in 3D space to transform the rendered images, thus building 3D consistency across views implicitly. We validate our method on several appearance-variant scenes, and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with minimal training time and memory usage, without compromising rendering speeds. Additionally, it provides performance improvements for different Gaussian Splatting baselines in a plug-and-play manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025.

Our approach estimates 3D object-level changes by comparing two sets of unaligned images taken at different times. Leveraging 3DGS's novel view rendering and EfficientSAM's zero-shot segmentation capabilities, we detect 2D object-level changes, which are then associated and fused across views to estimate 3D change masks and object transformations. Our method can accurately identify changes in cluttered environments using sparse (as few as one) post-change images within as little as 18s. It does not rely on depth input, user instructions, pre-defined object classes, or object models -- An object is recognized simply if it has been re-arranged. Our approach is evaluated on both public and self-collected real-world datasets, achieving up to 14% higher accuracy and three orders of magnitude faster performance compared to the state-of-the-art radiance-field-based change detection method. This significant performance boost enables a broad range of downstream applications, where we highlight three key use cases: object reconstruction, robot workspace reset, and 3DGS model update.

This nonetheless arises while describing general concepts, e.g. all traffic lights in a city. To facilitate reasoning based on such concepts, text localization in the form of distribution is required. In this paper, we generate the distribution of the camera poses conditioned upon the textual description. To facilitate such generation, we propose a diffusion-based architecture that conditionally diffuses the noisy 6DoF camera poses to their plausible locations. The conditional signals are derived from the text descriptions, using the pre-trained text encoders. The connection between text descriptions and pose distribution is established through pretrained Vision-Language-Model, i.e. CLIP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the candidate poses for the distribution can be further refined by rendering potential poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, guiding incorrectly posed samples towards locations that better align with the textual description, through visual reasoning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with both standard retrieval methods and learning-based approaches. Our proposed method consistently outperforms these baselines across all five large-scale datasets. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators. However, the generated scenes occupy large amounts of storage space and often lack effective regularisation methods, leading to geometric distortions. To this end, we propose BloomScene, a lightweight structured 3D Gaussian splatting for crossmodal scene generation, which creates diverse and high-quality 3D scenes from text or image inputs. Specifically, a crossmodal progressive scene generation framework is proposed to generate coherent scenes utilizing incremental point cloud reconstruction and 3D Gaussian splatting. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical depth prior-based regularization mechanism that utilizes multi-level constraints on depth accuracy and smoothness to enhance the realism and continuity of the generated scenes. Ultimately, we propose a structured context-guided compression mechanism that exploits structured hash grids to model the context of unorganized anchor attributes, which significantly eliminates structural redundancy and reduces storage overhead. Comprehensive experiments across multiple scenes demonstrate the significant potential and advantages of our framework compared with several baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing vision-only 3D-GS methods often rely on hand-crafted heuristics for point-cloud densification and face challenges in handling occlusions and high GPU memory and computation consumption. LiDAR-Inertial-Visual (LIV) sensor configuration has demonstrated superior performance in localization and dense mapping by leveraging complementary sensing characteristics: rich texture information from cameras, precise geometric measurements from LiDAR, and high-frequency motion data from IMU. Inspired by this, we propose a novel real-time Gaussian-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. Our map system comprises a global Gaussian map and a sliding window of Gaussians, along with an IESKF-based odometry. The global Gaussian map consists of hash-indexed voxels organized in a recursive octree, effectively covering sparse spatial volumes while adapting to different levels of detail and scales. The Gaussian map is initialized through multi-sensor fusion and optimized with photometric gradients. Our system incrementally maintains a sliding window of Gaussians, significantly reducing GPU computation and memory consumption by only optimizing the map within the sliding window. Moreover, we implement a tightly coupled multi-sensor fusion odometry with an iterative error state Kalman filter (IESKF), leveraging real-time updating and rendering of the Gaussian map. Our system represents the first real-time Gaussian-based SLAM framework deployable on resource-constrained embedded systems, demonstrated on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX platform.

| **[SplatMAP: Online Dense Monocular SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07015v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of traditional methods like Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and monocular SLAM in accurately capturing scene details. While differentiable rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) address some of these challenges, their high computational costs make them unsuitable for real-time applications. Additionally, existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods often focus on photometric consistency, neglecting geometric accuracy and failing to exploit SLAM's dynamic depth and pose updates for scene refinement. We propose a framework integrating dense SLAM with 3DGS for real-time, high-fidelity dense reconstruction. Our approach introduces SLAM-Informed Adaptive Densification, which dynamically updates and densifies the Gaussian model by leveraging dense point clouds from SLAM. Additionally, we incorporate Geometry-Guided Optimization, which combines edge-aware geometric constraints and photometric consistency to jointly optimize the appearance and geometry of the 3DGS scene representation, enabling detailed and accurate SLAM mapping reconstruction. Experiments on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results among monocular systems. Specifically, our method achieves a PSNR of 36.864, SSIM of 0.985, and LPIPS of 0.040 on Replica, representing improvements of 10.7%, 6.4%, and 49.4%, respectively, over the previous SOTA. On TUM-RGBD, our method outperforms the closest baseline by 10.2%, 6.6%, and 34.7% in the same metrics. These results highlight the potential of our framework in bridging the gap between photometric and geometric dense 3D scene representations, paving the way for practical and efficient monocular dense reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, such as empirical models and ray tracing, often fall short, either due to insufficient details or because of challenges for real-time applications. Inspired by the newly proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting method in the computer vision domain, which outperforms other methods in reconstructing optical radiance fields, we propose RF-3DGS, a novel approach that enables precise site-specific reconstruction of radio radiance fields from sparse samples. RF-3DGS can render radio spatial spectra at arbitrary positions within 2 ms following a brief 3-minute training period, effectively identifying dominant propagation paths. Furthermore, RF-3DGS can provide fine-grained Spatial Channel State Information (Spatial-CSI) of these paths, including the channel gain, the delay, the angle of arrival (AoA), and the angle of departure (AoD). Our experiments, calibrated through real-world measurements, demonstrate that RF-3DGS not only significantly improves reconstruction quality, training efficiency, and rendering speed compared to state-of-the-art methods, but also holds great potential for supporting wireless communication and advanced applications such as Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC).

However, its reliance on photometric losses can lead to imprecisely reconstructed geometry and extracted meshes, especially in regions with high curvature or fine detail. We propose a novel regularization method using the gradients of a signed distance function estimated from the Gaussians, to improve the quality of rendering while also extracting a surface mesh. The regularizing normal supervision facilitates better rendering and mesh reconstruction, which is crucial for downstream applications in video generation, animation, AR-VR and gaming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on datasets such as Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep-Blending. Our method scores higher on photorealism metrics compared to other mesh extracting rendering methods without compromising mesh quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025: Workshop on Generative Data Augmentation for Real-World Signal Processing Applications</p></details> |

It is also of higher quality, due to extensive quality checks of both the collected videos and the 3D annotations. Similar to analogous datasets, uCO3D contains annotations for 3D camera poses, depth maps and sparse point clouds. In addition, each object is equipped with a caption and a 3D Gaussian Splat reconstruction. We train several large 3D models on MVImgNet, CO3Dv2, and uCO3D and obtain superior results using the latter, showing that uCO3D is better for learning applications.</p></details> |  |

To achieve that, we extend such a model for diverse-view human head generation by fine-tuning on synthetic data and modifying its conditioning. Our avatars maintain a dense correspondence with a human face mesh template, allowing blendshape-based expression generation. This is achieved through a modified 3DGS approach, connectivity regularizers, and a strategic initialization tailored for our task. Additionally, we propose an optional efficient SDS-based correction step to refine the blendshape expressions, enhancing realism and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that Arc2Avatar achieves state-of-the-art realism and identity preservation, effectively addressing color issues by allowing the use of very low guidance, enabled by our strong identity prior and initialization strategy, without compromising detail.

In contrast, point clouds are a widely used 3D representation and are compatible with most popular 3D processing software, yet converting 3DGS scenes into point clouds is a complex challenge. In this work we introduce 3DGS-to-PC, a flexible and highly customisable framework that is capable of transforming 3DGS scenes into dense, high-accuracy point clouds. We sample points probabilistically from each Gaussian as a 3D density function. We additionally threshold new points using the Mahalanobis distance to the Gaussian centre, preventing extreme outliers. The result is a point cloud that closely represents the shape encoded into the 3D Gaussian scene. Individual Gaussians use spherical harmonics to adapt colours depending on view, and each point may contribute only subtle colour hints to the resulting rendered scene. To avoid spurious or incorrect colours that do not fit with the final point cloud, we recalculate Gaussian colours via a customised image rendering approach, assigning each Gaussian the colour of the pixel to which it contributes most across all views. 3DGS-to-PC also supports mesh generation through Poisson Surface Reconstruction, applied to points sampled from predicted surface Gaussians. This allows coloured meshes to be generated from 3DGS scenes without the need for re-training. This package is highly customisable and capability of simple integration into existing 3DGS pipelines. 3DGS-to-PC provides a powerful tool for converting 3DGS data into point cloud and surface-based formats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Prior for Few-Shot Drivable Head Avatar Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06903v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SynShot, a novel method for the few-shot inversion of a drivable head avatar based on a synthetic prior. We tackle two major challenges. First, training a controllable 3D generative network requires a large number of diverse sequences, for which pairs of images and high-quality tracked meshes are not always available. Second, state-of-the-art monocular avatar models struggle to generalize to new views and expressions, lacking a strong prior and often overfitting to a specific viewpoint distribution. Inspired by machine learning models trained solely on synthetic data, we propose a method that learns a prior model from a large dataset of synthetic heads with diverse identities, expressions, and viewpoints. With few input images, SynShot fine-tunes the pretrained synthetic prior to bridge the domain gap, modeling a photorealistic head avatar that generalizes to novel expressions and viewpoints. We model the head avatar using 3D Gaussian splatting and a convolutional encoder-decoder that outputs Gaussian parameters in UV texture space. To account for the different modeling complexities over parts of the head (e.g., skin vs hair), we embed the prior with explicit control for upsampling the number of per-part primitives. Compared to state-of-the-art monocular methods that require thousands of real training images, SynShot significantly improves novel view and expression synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website https://zielon.github.io/synshot/</p></details> |

Unlike traditional NeRF-based methods, which are computationally demanding and restrict active mapping performance, our approach leverages the efficient rendering capabilities of 3DGS, allowing effective and efficient exploration in complex environments. The core of our system is a rendering-based information gain module that dynamically identifies the most informative viewpoints for next-best-view planning, enhancing both geometric and photometric reconstruction accuracy. ActiveGAMER also integrates a carefully balanced framework, combining coarse-to-fine exploration, post-refinement, and a global-local keyframe selection strategy to maximize reconstruction completeness and fidelity. Our system autonomously explores and reconstructs environments with state-of-the-art geometric and photometric accuracy and completeness, significantly surpassing existing approaches in both aspects. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as Replica and MP3D highlight ActiveGAMER's effectiveness in active mapping tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[NVS-SQA: Exploring Self-Supervised Quality Representation Learning for Neurally Synthesized Scenes without References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06488v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural View Synthesis (NVS), such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, effectively creates photorealistic scenes from sparse viewpoints, typically evaluated by quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. However, these full-reference methods, which compare synthesized views to reference views, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of neurally synthesized scenes (NSS), particularly due to the limited availability of dense reference views. Furthermore, the challenges in acquiring human perceptual labels hinder the creation of extensive labeled datasets, risking model overfitting and reduced generalizability. To address these issues, we propose NVS-SQA, a NSS quality assessment method to learn no-reference quality representations through self-supervision without reliance on human labels. Traditional self-supervised learning predominantly relies on the "same instance, similar representation" assumption and extensive datasets. However, given that these conditions do not apply in NSS quality assessment, we employ heuristic cues and quality scores as learning objectives, along with a specialized contrastive pair preparation process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. The results show that NVS-SQA outperforms 17 no-reference methods by a large margin (i.e., on average 109.5% in SRCC, 98.6% in PLCC, and 91.5% in KRCC over the second best) and even exceeds 16 full-reference methods across all evaluation metrics (i.e., 22.9% in SRCC, 19.1% in PLCC, and 18.6% in KRCC over the second best).</p></details> |  |

However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, it is difficult to guarantee geometric reconstruction accuracy and multi-view consistency simply by relying on image reconstruction loss. Although many studies on surface reconstruction based on 3DGS have emerged recently, the quality of their meshes is generally unsatisfactory. To address this problem, we propose a fast planar-based Gaussian splatting reconstruction representation (PGSR) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstruction while ensuring high-quality rendering. Specifically, we first introduce an unbiased depth rendering method, which directly renders the distance from the camera origin to the Gaussian plane and the corresponding normal map based on the Gaussian distribution of the point cloud, and divides the two to obtain the unbiased depth. We then introduce single-view geometric, multi-view photometric, and geometric regularization to preserve global geometric accuracy. We also propose a camera exposure compensation model to cope with scenes with large illumination variations. Experiments on indoor and outdoor scenes show that our method achieves fast training and rendering while maintaining high-fidelity rendering and geometric reconstruction, outperforming 3DGS-based and NeRF-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zju3dv.github.io/pgsr/</p></details> |

On top of the novel representation, LocoGS is carefully designed with additional components such as dense initialization, an adaptive spherical harmonics bandwidth scheme and different encoding schemes for different Gaussian attributes to maximize compression performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the rendering quality of existing compact Gaussian representations for representative real-world 3D datasets while achieving from 54.6$\times$ to 96.6$\times$ compressed storage size and from 2.1$\times$ to 2.4$\times$ rendering speed than 3DGS.

However, direct 3D generation is still constrained by the scarcity and lower fidelity of 3D datasets. In this paper, we introduce Zero-1-to-G, a novel approach that addresses this problem by enabling direct single-view generation on Gaussian splats using pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our key insight is that Gaussian splats, a 3D representation, can be decomposed into multi-view images encoding different attributes. This reframes the challenging task of direct 3D generation within a 2D diffusion framework, allowing us to leverage the rich priors of pretrained 2D diffusion models. To incorporate 3D awareness, we introduce cross-view and cross-attribute attention layers, which capture complex correlations and enforce 3D consistency across generated splats. This makes Zero-1-to-G the first direct image-to-3D generative model to effectively utilize pretrained 2D diffusion priors, enabling efficient training and improved generalization to unseen objects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate superior performance in 3D object generation, offering a new approach to high-quality 3D generation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing SLAM methods utilizing 3DGS have failed to provide high-quality novel view rendering for monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras simultaneously. Notably, some methods perform well for RGB-D cameras but suffer significant degradation in rendering quality for monocular cameras. In this paper, we present Scaffold-SLAM, which delivers simultaneous localization and high-quality photorealistic mapping across monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras. We introduce two key innovations to achieve this state-of-the-art visual quality. First, we propose Appearance-from-Motion embedding, enabling 3D Gaussians to better model image appearance variations across different camera poses. Second, we introduce a frequency regularization pyramid to guide the distribution of Gaussians, allowing the model to effectively capture finer details in the scene. Extensive experiments on monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets demonstrate that Scaffold-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in photorealistic mapping quality, e.g., PSNR is 16.76% higher in the TUM RGB-D datasets for monocular cameras.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

By leveraging Neural ODEs, our approach learns smooth camera trajectories while maintaining an explicit 3D scene representation through Gaussians. Additionally, we introduce a spatiotemporal hierarchical learning strategy, progressively refining spatial and temporal features to enhance reconstruction quality and accelerate convergence. This memory-efficient approach achieves high-quality rendering at impressive speeds. Experimental results show that our hierarchical learning, combined with robust camera motion modeling, captures complex dynamic scenes with strong temporal consistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse video datasets in both high- and low-motion scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

However, training a 3DGS model remains a time-intensive task, especially in load imbalance scenarios where workload diversity among pixels and Gaussian spheres causes poor renderCUDA kernel performance. We introduce Balanced 3DGS, a Gaussian-wise parallelism rendering with fine-grained tiling approach in 3DGS training process, perfectly solving load-imbalance issues. First, we innovatively introduce the inter-block dynamic workload distribution technique to map workloads to Streaming Multiprocessor(SM) resources within a single GPU dynamically, which constitutes the foundation of load balancing. Second, we are the first to propose the Gaussian-wise parallel rendering technique to significantly reduce workload divergence inside a warp, which serves as a critical component in addressing load imbalance. Based on the above two methods, we further creatively put forward the fine-grained combined load balancing technique to uniformly distribute workload across all SMs, which boosts the forward renderCUDA kernel performance by up to 7.52x. Besides, we present a self-adaptive render kernel selection strategy during the 3DGS training process based on different load-balance situations, which effectively improves training efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Despite delivering remarkable rendering quality and speed, existing methods struggle with storage demands and representing complex real-world motions. To tackle these issues, we propose MoDecGS, a memory-efficient Gaussian splatting framework designed for reconstructing novel views in challenging scenarios with complex motions. We introduce GlobaltoLocal Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to effectively capture dynamic motions in a coarsetofine manner. This approach leverages Global Canonical Scaffolds (Global CS) and Local Canonical Scaffolds (Local CS), extending static Scaffold representation to dynamic video reconstruction. For Global CS, we propose Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) to efficiently represent global dynamics along complex motions, by directly deforming the implicit Scaffold attributes which are anchor position, offset, and local context features. Next, we finely adjust local motions via the Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) of Local CS explicitly. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to automatically control the temporal coverage of each Local CS during training, allowing MoDecGS to find optimal interval assignments based on the specified number of temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MoDecGS achieves an average 70% reduction in model size over stateoftheart methods for dynamic 3D Gaussians from realworld dynamic videos while maintaining or even improving rendering quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>The l...</summary><p>The last two authors are co-corresponding authors.

However, its substantial data requirements present challenges for practical applications. In this paper, we introduce an efficient compression technique that significantly reduces storage overhead by using compact representation. We propose a unified architecture that combines point cloud data and feature planes through a progressive tri-plane structure. Our method utilizes 2D feature planes, enabling continuous spatial representation. To further optimize these representations, we incorporate entropy modeling in the frequency domain, specifically designed for standard video codecs. We also propose channel-wise bit allocation to achieve a better trade-off between bitrate consumption and feature plane representation. Consequently, our model effectively leverages spatial correlations within the feature planes to enhance rate-distortion performance using standard, non-differentiable video codecs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in data compactness while maintaining high rendering quality.

However, due to significant occlusions between hands and object as well as the high degree-of-freedom motions, it is challenging to collect and annotate a high-quality, large-scale dataset, which prevents further improvement of bimanual hand-object interaction-related baselines. In this work, we propose a new 3D Gaussian Splatting based data augmentation framework for bimanual hand-object interaction, which is capable of augmenting existing dataset to large-scale photorealistic data with various hand-object pose and viewpoints. First, we use mesh-based 3DGS to model objects and hands, and to deal with the rendering blur problem due to multi-resolution input images used, we design a super-resolution module. Second, we extend the single hand grasping pose optimization module for the bimanual hand object to generate various poses of bimanual hand-object interaction, which can significantly expand the pose distribution of the dataset. Third, we conduct an analysis for the impact of different aspects of the proposed data augmentation on the understanding of the bimanual hand-object interaction.

However, in trained scenes, a large number of Gaussians with low opacity significantly increase rendering costs. This issue arises due to flaws in the split and clone operations during the densification process, which lead to extensive Gaussian overlap and subsequent opacity reduction. To enhance the efficiency of Gaussian utilization, we improve the adaptive density control of 3DGS. First, we introduce a more efficient long-axis split operation to replace the original clone and split, which mitigates Gaussian overlap and improves densification efficiency.Second, we propose a simple adaptive pruning technique to reduce the number of low-opacity Gaussians. Finally, by dynamically lowering the splitting threshold and applying importance weighting, the efficiency of Gaussian utilization is further improved. We evaluate our proposed method on various challenging real-world datasets. Experimental results show that our Efficient Density Control (EDC) can enhance both the rendering speed and quality.

The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has effectively addressed key challenges, such as long training times and slow rendering speeds, typically associated with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), while maintaining high-quality reconstructions. In this work (BeSplat), we demonstrate the recovery of sharp radiance field (Gaussian splats) from a single motion-blurred image and its corresponding event stream. Our method jointly learns the scene representation via Gaussian Splatting and recovers the camera motion through Bezier SE(3) formulation effectively, minimizing discrepancies between synthesized and real-world measurements of both blurry image and corresponding event stream.

Reconstruction-based methods create 3D scenes from driving logs and synthesize geometry-consistent driving videos through neural rendering, but their dependence on costly object annotations limits their ability to generalize to in-the-wild driving scenarios. On the other hand, generative models can synthesize action-conditioned driving videos in a more generalizable way but often struggle with maintaining 3D visual consistency. In this paper, we present DreamDrive, a 4D spatial-temporal scene generation approach that combines the merits of generation and reconstruction, to synthesize generalizable 4D driving scenes and dynamic driving videos with 3D consistency. Specifically, we leverage the generative power of video diffusion models to synthesize a sequence of visual references and further elevate them to 4D with a novel hybrid Gaussian representation. Given a driving trajectory, we then render 3D-consistent driving videos via Gaussian splatting. The use of generative priors allows our method to produce high-quality 4D scenes from in-the-wild driving data, while neural rendering ensures 3D-consistent video generation from the 4D scenes. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and street view images demonstrate that DreamDrive can generate controllable and generalizable 4D driving scenes, synthesize novel views of driving videos with high fidelity and 3D consistency, decompose static and dynamic elements in a self-supervised manner, and enhance perception and planning tasks for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pointscoder.github.io/DreamDrive/</p></details> |

Cloth-Splatting leverages an action-conditioned dynamics model for predicting future states and uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to update the predicted states. Our key insight is that coupling a 3D mesh-based representation with Gaussian Splatting allows us to define a differentiable map between the cloth state space and the image space. This enables the use of gradient-based optimization techniques to refine inaccurate state estimates using only RGB supervision.

While existing 3DGS methods perform well in scenes with minor view variation, large view changes in cross-view scenes pose optimization challenges for these methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-view Gaussian Splatting method for large-scale scene reconstruction, based on dual-branch fusion. Our method independently reconstructs models from aerial and ground views as two independent branches to establish the baselines of Gaussian distribution, providing reliable priors for cross-view reconstruction during both initialization and densification. Specifically, a gradient-aware regularization strategy is introduced to mitigate smoothing issues caused by significant view disparities. Additionally, a unique Gaussian supplementation strategy is utilized to incorporate complementary information of dual-branch into the cross-view model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in novel view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Based on 3DGS, recent advancements cope with large-scale scenes via spatial-based partition strategy to reduce video memory and optimization time costs. In this work, we introduce a parallel Gaussian splatting method, termed PG-SAG, which fully exploits semantic cues for both partitioning and Gaussian kernel optimization, enabling fine-grained building surface reconstruction of large-scale urban areas without downsampling the original image resolution. First, the Cross-modal model - Language Segment Anything is leveraged to segment building masks. Then, the segmented building regions is grouped into sub-regions according to the visibility check across registered images. The Gaussian kernels for these sub-regions are optimized in parallel with masked pixels. In addition, the normal loss is re-formulated for the detected edges of masks to alleviate the ambiguities in normal vectors on edges. Finally, to improve the optimization of 3D Gaussians, we introduce a gradient-constrained balance-load loss that accounts for the complexity of the corresponding scenes, effectively minimizing the thread waiting time in the pixel-parallel rendering stage as well as the reconstruction lost. Extensive experiments are tested on various urban datasets, the results demonstrated the superior performance of our PG-SAG on building surface reconstruction, compared to several state-of-the-art 3DGS-based methods.

| **[Deformable Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and High-Fidelity Reconstruction of Surgical Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01101v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction of deformable surgical scenes is a critical yet challenging task. Building on recent advancements in 3D Gaussian splatting, current methods have seen significant improvements in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. However, two major limitations remain: (1) difficulty in handling irreversible dynamic changes, such as tissue shearing, which are common in surgical scenes; and (2) the lack of hierarchical modeling for surgical scene deformation, which reduces rendering speed. To address these challenges, we introduce EH-SurGS, an efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction algorithm for deformable surgical scenes. We propose a deformation modeling approach that incorporates the life cycle of 3D Gaussians, effectively capturing both regular and irreversible deformations, thus enhancing reconstruction quality. Additionally, we present an adaptive motion hierarchy strategy that distinguishes between static and deformable regions within the surgical scene. This strategy reduces the number of 3D Gaussians passing through the deformation field, thereby improving rendering speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed components. We will open-source our code upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video. (https://github.com/runnanchen/PanoSLAM)</p></details> |  |

However, reliance on third-degree spherical harmonics for color representation introduces significant storage demands and computational overhead, resulting in a large memory footprint and slower rendering speed. We introduce SG-Splatting with Spherical Gaussians based color representation, a novel approach to enhance rendering speed and quality in novel view synthesis. Our method first represents view-dependent color using Spherical Gaussians, instead of three degree spherical harmonics, which largely reduces the number of parameters used for color representation, and significantly accelerates the rendering process. We then develop an efficient strategy for organizing multiple Spherical Gaussians, optimizing their arrangement to achieve a balanced and accurate scene representation. To further improve rendering quality, we propose a mixed representation that combines Spherical Gaussians with low-degree spherical harmonics, capturing both high- and low-frequency color information effectively. SG-Splatting also has plug-and-play capability, allowing it to be easily integrated into existing systems. This approach improves computational efficiency and overall visual fidelity, making it a practical solution for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |

Our avatar model enables facial attribute editing in a continuous and disentangled latent space to control each facial attribute, while preserving the individual's identity. To achieve this, our method begins by synthesizing large-scale synthetic 2D video datasets, where each video contains consistent changes in the facial expression and viewpoint, combined with a variation in a specific facial attribute from the original input. We propose a novel pipeline to produce high-quality, photorealistic 2D videos with facial attribute editing. Leveraging this synthetic attribute dataset, we present a personalized avatar creation method based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting, learning a continuous and disentangled latent space for intuitive facial attribute manipulation. To enforce smooth transitions in this latent space, we introduce a latent space regularization technique by using interpolated 2D faces as supervision. Compared to previous approaches, we demonstrate that PERSE generates high-quality avatars with interpolated attributes while preserving identity of reference person.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyunsoocha.github.io/perse/</p></details> |

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained prominence due to its explicit representation with efficient training speed and real-time rendering capabilities. However, existing methods still heavily depend on accurate camera poses for reconstruction. Although some recent approaches attempt to train 3DGS models without the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) preprocessing from monocular video datasets, these methods suffer from prolonged training times, making them impractical for many applications. In this paper, we present an efficient framework that operates without any depth or matching model. Our approach initially uses SfM to quickly obtain rough camera poses within seconds, and then refines these poses by leveraging the dense representation in 3DGS. This framework effectively addresses the issue of long training times. Additionally, we integrate the densification process with joint refinement and propose a coarse-to-fine frequency-aware densification to reconstruct different levels of details. This approach prevents camera pose estimation from being trapped in local minima or drifting due to high-frequency signals. Our method significantly reduces training time from hours to minutes while achieving more accurate novel view synthesis and camera pose estimation compared to previous methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18862v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

| **[MaskGaussian: Adaptive 3D Gaussian Representation from Probabilistic Masks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20522v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis and real-time rendering, the high memory consumption due to the use of millions of Gaussians limits its practicality. To mitigate this issue, improvements have been made by pruning unnecessary Gaussians, either through a hand-crafted criterion or by using learned masks. However, these methods deterministically remove Gaussians based on a snapshot of the pruning moment, leading to sub-optimized reconstruction performance from a long-term perspective. To address this issue, we introduce MaskGaussian, which models Gaussians as probabilistic entities rather than permanently removing them, and utilize them according to their probability of existence. To achieve this, we propose a masked-rasterization technique that enables unused yet probabilistically existing Gaussians to receive gradients, allowing for dynamic assessment of their contribution to the evolving scene and adjustment of their probability of existence. Hence, the importance of Gaussians iteratively changes and the pruned Gaussians are selected diversely. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving better rendering quality with fewer Gaussians than previous pruning methods, pruning over 60% of Gaussians on average with only a 0.02 PSNR decline.

To tackle these challenges in existing methods, we propose a decomposed per-embedding Gaussian fields (DEGSTalk), a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based talking face synthesis method for generating realistic talking faces with long hairs. Our DEGSTalk employs Deformable Pre-Embedding Gaussian Fields, which dynamically adjust pre-embedding Gaussian primitives using implicit expression coefficients. This enables precise capture of dynamic facial regions and subtle expressions. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Hair-Preserving Portrait Rendering technique to enhance the realism of long hair motions in the synthesized videos. Results show that DEGSTalk achieves improved realism and synthesis quality compared to existing approaches, particularly in handling complex facial dynamics and hair preservation.

| **[Dust to Tower: Coarse-to-Fine Photo-Realistic Scene Reconstruction from Sparse Uncalibrated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19518v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photo-realistic scene reconstruction from sparse-view, uncalibrated images is highly required in practice. Although some successes have been made, existing methods are either Sparse-View but require accurate camera parameters (i.e., intrinsic and extrinsic), or SfM-free but need densely captured images. To combine the advantages of both methods while addressing their respective weaknesses, we propose Dust to Tower (D2T), an accurate and efficient coarse-to-fine framework to optimize 3DGS and image poses simultaneously from sparse and uncalibrated images. Our key idea is to first construct a coarse model efficiently and subsequently refine it using warped and inpainted images at novel viewpoints. To do this, we first introduce a Coarse Construction Module (CCM) which exploits a fast Multi-View Stereo model to initialize a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and recover initial camera poses. To refine the 3D model at novel viewpoints, we propose a Confidence Aware Depth Alignment (CADA) module to refine the coarse depth maps by aligning their confident parts with estimated depths by a Mono-depth model. Then, a Warped Image-Guided Inpainting (WIGI) module is proposed to warp the training images to novel viewpoints by the refined depth maps, and inpainting is applied to fulfill the ``holes" in the warped images caused by view-direction changes, providing high-quality supervision to further optimize the 3D model and the camera poses. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the validity of D2T and its design choices, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks of novel view synthesis and pose estimation while keeping high efficiency.

SCI is a cost-effective method that enables the recording of high-dimensional data, such as hyperspectral or temporal information, into a single image using low-cost 2D imaging sensors. To achieve this, a series of specially designed 2D masks are usually employed, reducing storage and transmission requirements and offering potential privacy protection. Inspired by this, we take one step further to recover the encoded 3D scene information leveraging powerful 3D scene representation capabilities of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specifically, we propose SCINeRF, in which we formulate the physical imaging process of SCI as part of the training of NeRF, allowing us to exploit its impressive performance in capturing complex scene structures. In addition, we further integrate the popular 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework and propose SCISplat to improve 3D scene reconstruction quality and training/rendering speed by explicitly optimizing point clouds into 3D Gaussian representations. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive evaluations using both synthetic data and real data captured by our SCI system. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of image reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, our method also exhibits the ability to render high frame-rate multi-view consistent images in real time by leveraging SCI and the rendering capabilities of 3DGS.

Traditional 3D-aware generative adversarial networks (GANs), often using implicit fields like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), achieve photorealistic and view-consistent 3D head synthesis. However, these methods face limitations in deformation flexibility and editability, hindering the creation of lifelike and easily modifiable 3D heads. We propose a novel approach that enhances the editability and animation control of 3D head avatars by incorporating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as an explicit 3D representation. This method enables easier illumination control and improved editability. Central to our approach is the Editable Gaussian Head (EG-Head) model, which combines a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with texture maps, allowing precise expression control and flexible texture editing for accurate animation while preserving identity. To capture complex non-facial geometries like hair, we use an auxiliary set of 3DGS and tri-plane features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers high-quality 3D-aware synthesis with state-of-the-art controllability.

However, typically 3D multimodal models are only capable of handling point clouds. Compared to the emerging 3D representation technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the spatially sparse point cloud cannot depict the texture information of 3D objects, resulting in inferior reconstruction capabilities. This limitation constrains the potential of point cloud-based 3D multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we present CLIP-GS, a novel multimodal representation learning framework grounded in 3DGS. We introduce the GS Tokenizer to generate serialized gaussian tokens, which are then processed through transformer layers pre-initialized with weights from point cloud models, resulting in the 3DGS embeddings. CLIP-GS leverages contrastive loss between 3DGS and the visual-text embeddings of CLIP, and we introduce an image voting loss to guide the directionality and convergence of gradient optimization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient way to generate triplets of 3DGS, images, and text, facilitating CLIP-GS in learning unified multimodal representations. Leveraging the well-aligned multimodal representations, CLIP-GS demonstrates versatility and outperforms point cloud-based models on various 3D tasks, including multimodal retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification.</p></details> |  |

Previous research has tackled this issue by incorporating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as scene representations within dense SLAM methods. However, most studies focus primarily on estimating coarse 3D scenes rather than achieving detailed reconstructions. Moreover, depth estimation based solely on images is often ambiguous, resulting in low-quality 3D models that lead to inaccurate renderings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for high-quality 3DGS modeling that leverages an online multi-view stereo (MVS) approach. Our method estimates MVS depth using sequential frames from a local time window and applies comprehensive depth refinement techniques to filter out outliers, enabling accurate initialization of Gaussians in 3DGS. Furthermore, we introduce a parallelized backend module that optimizes the 3DGS model efficiently, ensuring timely updates with each new keyframe.

It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce GSAVS, an autonomous vehicle simulator that supports the creation and development of autonomous vehicle models. Every asset within the simulator is a 3D Gaussian splat, including the vehicles and the environment. However, the simulator runs within a classical 3D engine, rendering 3D Gaussian splats in real-time.

However, recent methods often struggle to maintain local consistency in color and texture throughout stylized scenes, which is essential for maintaining aesthetic coherence. To solve this problem, this paper introduces ArtNVG, an innovative 3D stylization framework that efficiently generates stylized 3D scenes by leveraging reference style images. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), ArtNVG achieves rapid optimization and rendering while upholding high reconstruction quality. Our framework realizes high-quality 3D stylization by incorporating two pivotal techniques: Content-Style Separated Control and Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment. Content-Style Separated Control uses the CSGO model and the Tile ControlNet to decouple the content and style control, reducing risks of information leakage. Concurrently, Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment ensures consistency of local colors and textures across neighboring views, significantly improving visual quality. Extensive experiments validate that ArtNVG surpasses existing methods, delivering superior results in content preservation, style alignment, and local consistency.</p></details> |  |

While extant research has endeavored to extend the application of 3DGS from static to dynamic scenes, such efforts have been consistently impeded by excessive model sizes, constraints on video duration, and content deviation. These limitations significantly compromise the streamability of dynamic 3D Gaussian models, thereby restricting their utility in downstream applications, including volumetric video, autonomous vehicle, and immersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. This paper introduces SwinGS, a novel framework for training, delivering, and rendering volumetric video in a real-time streaming fashion. To address the aforementioned challenges and enhance streamability, SwinGS integrates spacetime Gaussian with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to adapt the model to fit various 3D scenes across frames, in the meantime employing a sliding window captures Gaussian snapshots for each frame in an accumulative way. We implement a prototype of SwinGS and demonstrate its streamability across various datasets and scenes. Additionally, we develop an interactive WebGL viewer enabling real-time volumetric video playback on most devices with modern browsers, including smartphones and tablets. Experimental results show that SwinGS reduces transmission costs by 83.6% compared to previous work with ignorable compromise in PSNR. Moreover, SwinGS easily scales to long video sequences without compromising quality.</p></details> |  |

These generated views then serve as input to a GS-LRM reconstructor, which produces a comprehensive 3D representation using Gaussian splats. To train our system, we develop a dataset of multi-view renderings using synthetic 3D human head as-sets. The diffusion-based multi-view generator is trained exclusively on synthetic head images, while the GS-LRM reconstructor undergoes initial training on Objaverse followed by fine-tuning on synthetic head data. FaceLift excels at preserving identity and maintaining view consistency across views. Despite being trained solely on synthetic data, FaceLift demonstrates remarkable generalization to real-world images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show that FaceLift outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D head reconstruction, highlighting its practical applicability and robust performance on real-world images. In addition to single image reconstruction, FaceLift supports video inputs for 4D novel view synthesis and seamlessly integrates with 2D reanimation techniques to enable 3D facial animation.

GaussianPainter introduces an innovative feed-forward approach to overcome the limitations of time-consuming test-time optimization in 3D Gaussian splatting. Our method addresses a critical challenge in the field: the non-uniqueness problem inherent in the large parameter space of 3D Gaussian splatting. This space, encompassing rotation, anisotropic scales, and spherical harmonic coefficients, introduces the challenge of rendering similar images from substantially different Gaussian fields. As a result, feed-forward networks face instability when attempting to directly predict high-quality Gaussian fields, struggling to converge on consistent parameters for a given output. To address this issue, we propose to estimate a surface normal for each point to determine its Gaussian rotation. This strategy enables the network to effectively predict the remaining Gaussian parameters in the constrained space. We further enhance our approach with an appearance injection module, incorporating reference image appearance into Gaussian fields via a multiscale triplane representation. Our method successfully balances efficiency and fidelity in 3D Gaussian generation, achieving high-quality, diverse, and robust 3D content creation from point clouds in a single forward pass.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing GS-based surface reconstruction methods focus on 3D objects or limited scenes. Directly applying these methods to large-scale scene reconstruction will pose challenges such as high memory costs, excessive time consumption, and lack of geometric detail, which makes it difficult to implement in practical applications. To address these issues, we propose a multi-agent collaborative fast 3DGS surface reconstruction framework based on distributed learning for large-scale surface reconstruction. Specifically, we develop local model compression (LMC) and model aggregation schemes (MAS) to achieve high-quality surface representation of large scenes while reducing GPU memory consumption. Extensive experiments on Urban3d, MegaNeRF, and BlendedMVS demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve fast and scalable high-fidelity surface reconstruction and photorealistic rendering.

However, 3DGS assumes that the scene is in a clear medium environment and struggles to generate satisfactory representations in underwater scenes, where light absorption and scattering are prevalent and moving objects are involved. To overcome these, we introduce a novel Gaussian Splatting-based method, UW-GS, designed specifically for underwater applications. It introduces a color appearance that models distance-dependent color variation, employs a new physics-based density control strategy to enhance clarity for distant objects, and uses a binary motion mask to handle dynamic content. Optimized with a well-designed loss function supporting for scattering media and strengthened by pseudo-depth maps, UW-GS outperforms existing methods with PSNR gains up to 1.26dB. To fully verify the effectiveness of the model, we also developed a new underwater dataset, S-UW, with dynamic object masks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF WACV 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a robust watermarking method for 3D-GS that secures ownership of both the model and its rendered images. Our proposed method remains robust against distortions in rendered images and model attacks while maintaining high rendering quality. To achieve these objectives, we present Frequency-Guided Densification~(FGD), which removes 3D Gaussians based on their contribution to rendering quality, enhancing real-time rendering and the robustness of the message. FGD utilizes Discrete Fourier Transform to split 3D Gaussians in high-frequency areas, improving rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ a gradient mask for 3D Gaussians and design a wavelet-subband loss to enhance rendering quality. Our experiments show that our method embeds the message in the rendered images invisibly and robustly against various attacks, including model distortion. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: https://kuai-lab.github.io/3dgsw2024/</p></details> |  |

Harnessing superior learning speed and real-time rendering capabilities, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated considerable potential in this field. However, 3DGS can be inefficient in terms of storage and prone to overfitting by excessively growing Gaussians, particularly with limited views. This paper proposes an efficient framework, dubbed HiCoM, with three key components. First, we construct a compact and robust initial 3DGS representation using a perturbation smoothing strategy. Next, we introduce a Hierarchical Coherent Motion mechanism that leverages the inherent non-uniform distribution and local consistency of 3D Gaussians to swiftly and accurately learn motions across frames. Finally, we continually refine the 3DGS with additional Gaussians, which are later merged into the initial 3DGS to maintain consistency with the evolving scene. To preserve a compact representation, an equivalent number of low-opacity Gaussians that minimally impact the representation are removed before processing subsequent frames. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used datasets show that our framework improves learning efficiency of the state-of-the-art methods by about $20\%$ and reduces the data storage by $85\%$, achieving competitive free-viewpoint video synthesis quality but with higher robustness and stability. Moreover, by parallel learning multiple frames simultaneously, our HiCoM decreases the average training wall time to $<2$ seconds per frame with negligible performance degradation, substantially boosting real-world applicability and responsiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024; Code is avaliable at https://github.com/gqk/HiCoM</p></details> |

Recent advancements based on 3D Gaussian Splatting have integrated semantic information from multi-view images into Gaussian primitives. However, these methods typically require costly per-scene optimization from dense calibrated images, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we consider the new task of generalizable 3D semantic field modeling from sparse, uncalibrated image pairs. Building upon the Splatt3R architecture, we introduce GSemSplat, a framework that learns open-vocabulary semantic representations linked to 3D Gaussians without the need for per-scene optimization, dense image collections or calibration. To ensure effective and reliable learning of semantic features in 3D space, we employ a dual-feature approach that leverages both region-specific and context-aware semantic features as supervision in the 2D space. This allows us to capitalize on their complementary strengths. Experimental results on the ScanNet++ dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach compared to the traditional scene-specific method. We hope our work will inspire more research into generalizable 3D understanding.</p></details> |  |

High-quality reconstrution of 3DGS relies on sufficient splats and a reasonable distribution of these splats to fit real geometric surface and texture details, which turns out to be a challenging problem. We present GeoTexDensifier, a novel geometry-texture-aware densification strategy to reconstruct high-quality Gaussian splats which better comply with the geometric structure and texture richness of the scene. Specifically, our GeoTexDensifier framework carries out an auxiliary texture-aware densification method to produce a denser distribution of splats in fully textured areas, while keeping sparsity in low-texture regions to maintain the quality of Gaussian point cloud. Meanwhile, a geometry-aware splitting strategy takes depth and normal priors to guide the splitting sampling and filter out the noisy splats whose initial positions are far from the actual geometric surfaces they aim to fit, under a Validation of Depth Ratio Change checking. With the help of relative monocular depth prior, such geometry-aware validation can effectively reduce the influence of scattered Gaussians to the final rendering quality, especially in regions with weak textures or without sufficient training views. The texture-aware densification and geometry-aware splitting strategies are fully combined to obtain a set of high-quality Gaussian splats. We experiment our GeoTexDensifier framework on various datasets and compare our Novel View Synthesis results to other state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches, with detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing more photorealistic 3DGS models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Although omnidirectional images are getting more popular since they reduce the computation for image stitching to composite a holistic scene, existing feed-forward models are only designed for perspective images. The unique optical properties of omnidirectional images make it difficult for feature encoders to correctly understand the context of the image and make the Gaussian non-uniform in space, which hinders the image quality synthesized from novel views. We propose OmniSplat, a pioneering work for fast feed-forward 3DGS generation from a few omnidirectional images. We introduce Yin-Yang grid and decompose images based on it to reduce the domain gap between omnidirectional and perspective images. The Yin-Yang grid can use the existing CNN structure as it is, but its quasi-uniform characteristic allows the decomposed image to be similar to a perspective image, so it can exploit the strong prior knowledge of the learned feed-forward network. OmniSplat demonstrates higher reconstruction accuracy than existing feed-forward networks trained on perspective images. Furthermore, we enhance the segmentation consistency between omnidirectional images by leveraging attention from the encoder of OmniSplat, providing fast and clean 3DGS editing results.</p></details> |  |

Driving scene images from vehicle-mounted cameras are typically sparse, with limited overlap, and the movement of the vehicle further complicates the acquisition of camera extrinsics. To tackle these challenges and achieve real-time reconstruction, we jointly train a pose network, a depth network, and a Gaussian network to predict the Gaussian primitives that represent the driving scenes. The pose network and depth network determine the position of the Gaussian primitives in a self-supervised manner, without using depth ground truth and camera extrinsics during training. The Gaussian network independently predicts primitive parameters from each input image, including covariance, opacity, and spherical harmonics coefficients. At the inference stage, our model can achieve feed-forward reconstruction from flexible multi-frame surround-view input. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art feed-forward and scene-optimized reconstruction methods in terms of reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by AAAI 2025.

Despite the promising results achieved with 2D diffusion priors, current methods struggle to create high-quality and consistent animated avatars efficiently. Previous animatable head models like FLAME have difficulty in accurately representing detailed texture and geometry. Additionally, high-quality 3D static representations face challenges in semantically driving with dynamic priors. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{HeadStudio}, a novel framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian splatting to generate realistic and animatable avatars from text prompts. Firstly, we associate 3D Gaussians with animatable head prior model, facilitating semantic animation on high-quality 3D representations. To ensure consistent animation, we further enhance the optimization from initialization, distillation, and regularization to jointly learn the shape, texture, and animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of HeadStudio in generating animatable avatars from textual prompts, exhibiting appealing appearances. The avatars are capable of rendering high-quality real-time ($\geq 40$ fps) novel views at a resolution of 1024. Moreover, These avatars can be smoothly driven by real-world speech and video. We hope that HeadStudio can enhance digital avatar creation and gain popularity in the community.

While conventional methods depend on sharp images for accurate scene reconstruction, real-world scenarios are often affected by defocus blur due to finite depth of field, making it essential to account for realistic 3D scene representation. In this study, we propose CoCoGaussian, a Circle of Confusion-aware Gaussian Splatting that enables precise 3D scene representation using only defocused images. CoCoGaussian addresses the challenge of defocus blur by modeling the Circle of Confusion (CoC) through a physically grounded approach based on the principles of photographic defocus. Exploiting 3D Gaussians, we compute the CoC diameter from depth and learnable aperture information, generating multiple Gaussians to precisely capture the CoC shape. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable scaling factor to enhance robustness and provide more flexibility in handling unreliable depth in scenes with reflective or refractive surfaces. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CoCoGaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://Jho-Yonsei.github.io/CoCoGaussian/</p></details> |

Recent studies have explored signed distance fields (SDF) within Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstructions. However, these approaches often suffer from slow training and rendering speeds compared to 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). Current state-of-the-art techniques attempt to fuse depth information to extract geometry from 3DGS, but frequently result in incomplete reconstructions and fragmented surfaces. In this paper, we introduce GSurf, a novel end-to-end method for learning a signed distance field directly from Gaussian primitives. The continuous and smooth nature of SDF addresses common issues in the 3DGS family, such as holes resulting from noisy or missing depth data. By using Gaussian splatting for rendering, GSurf avoids the redundant volume rendering typically required in other GS and SDF integrations. Consequently, GSurf achieves faster training and rendering speeds while delivering 3D reconstruction quality comparable to neural implicit surface methods, such as VolSDF and NeuS. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>see h...</summary><p>see https://github.com/xubaixinxbx/Gsurf</p></details> |

However, existing automatic methods exhibit artifacts under novel poses due to limited information in the input video. We propose AvatarPerfect, a novel system that allows users to iteratively refine 3DGS avatars by manually editing the rendered avatar images. In each iteration, our system suggests a new body and camera pose to help users identify and correct artifacts. The edited images are then used to update the current avatar, and our system suggests the next body and camera pose for further refinement. To investigate the effectiveness of AvatarPerfect, we conducted a user study comparing our method to an existing 3DGS editor SuperSplat, which allows direct manipulation of Gaussians without automatic pose suggestions. The results indicate that our system enables users to obtain higher quality refined 3DGS avatars than the existing 3DGS editor.</p></details> | 13 pages |

We introduce Specialized Generative Primitives, a generative framework that allows non-expert users to author high-quality 3D scenes in a seamless, lightweight, and controllable manner. Each primitive is an efficient generative model that captures the distribution of a single exemplar from the real world. With our framework, users capture a video of an environment, which we turn into a high-quality and explicit appearance model thanks to 3D Gaussian Splatting. Users then select regions of interest guided by semantically-aware features. To create a generative primitive, we adapt Generative Cellular Automata to single-exemplar training and controllable generation. We decouple the generative task from the appearance model by operating on sparse voxels and we recover a high-quality output with a subsequent sparse patch consistency step. Each primitive can be trained within 10 minutes and used to author new scenes interactively in a fully compositional manner. We showcase interactive sessions where various primitives are extracted from real-world scenes and controlled to create 3D assets and scenes in a few minutes. We also demonstrate additional capabilities of our primitives: handling various 3D representations to control generation, transferring appearances, and editing geometries.</p></details> |  |

Some researchers have explored using 3D GS for reconstructing driving scenes. However, these methods often rely on various data types, such as depth maps, 3D boxes, and trajectories of moving objects. Additionally, the lack of annotations for synthesized images limits their direct application in downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose EGSRAL, a 3D GS-based method that relies solely on training images without extra annotations. EGSRAL enhances 3D GS's capability to model both dynamic objects and static backgrounds and introduces a novel adaptor for auto labeling, generating corresponding annotations based on existing annotations. We also propose a grouping strategy for vanilla 3D GS to address perspective issues in rendering large-scale, complex scenes. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets without any extra annotation. For example, the PSNR metric reaches 29.04 on the nuScenes dataset. Moreover, our automated labeling can significantly improve the performance of 2D/3D detection tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/jiangxb98/EGSRAL.</p></details> | AAAI2025 |

Previous weakly-supervised NeRF methods balance efficiency and accuracy, with mIoU varying by 5-10 points due to sampling count along camera rays. Recently, real-time Gaussian splatting has gained widespread popularity in 3D reconstruction, and the occupancy prediction task can also be viewed as a reconstruction task. Consequently, we propose GSRender, which naturally employs 3D Gaussian Splatting for occupancy prediction, simplifying the sampling process. In addition, the limitations of 2D supervision result in duplicate predictions along the same camera ray. We implemented the Ray Compensation (RC) module, which mitigates this issue by compensating for features from adjacent frames. Finally, we redesigned the loss to eliminate the impact of dynamic objects from adjacent frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves SOTA (state-of-the-art) results in RayIoU (+6.0), while narrowing the gap with 3D supervision methods. Our code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

However, directly applying 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a refinement step following these models presents challenges. We hypothesize that the excessive positional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in Gaussians induce geometry distortion, fitting color patterns at the cost of structural fidelity. To address this, we propose reprojection-based DoF separation, a method distinguishing positional DoFs in terms of uncertainty: image-plane-parallel DoFs and ray-aligned DoF. To independently manage each DoF, we introduce a reprojection process along with tailored constraints for each DoF. Through experiments across various datasets, we confirm that separating the positional DoFs of Gaussians and applying targeted constraints effectively suppresses geometric artifacts, producing reconstruction results that are both visually and geometrically plausible.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Although previous methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can achieve impressive results, they lack fidelity and efficiency. Recent methods using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved rendering quality and real-time performance but still require significant storage overhead. In this paper, we introduce a method called GraphAvatar that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to generate 3D Gaussians for the head avatar. Specifically, GraphAvatar trains a geometric GNN and an appearance GNN to generate the attributes of the 3D Gaussians from the tracked mesh. Therefore, our method can store the GNN models instead of the 3D Gaussians, significantly reducing the storage overhead to just 10MB. To reduce the impact of face-tracking errors, we also present a novel graph-guided optimization module to refine face-tracking parameters during training. Finally, we introduce a 3D-aware enhancer for post-processing to enhance the rendering quality. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of GraphAvatar, surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity and storage consumption. The ablation study sheds light on the trade-offs between rendering quality and model size. The code will be released at: https://github.com/ucwxb/GraphAvatar</p></details> | accepted by AAAI2025 |

In this paper, we propose GAGS, a framework that distills 2D CLIP features into 3D Gaussian splatting, enabling open-vocabulary queries for renderings on arbitrary viewpoints. The main challenge of distilling 2D features for 3D fields lies in the multiview inconsistency of extracted 2D features, which provides unstable supervision for the 3D feature field. GAGS addresses this challenge with two novel strategies. First, GAGS associates the prompt point density of SAM with the camera distances, which significantly improves the multiview consistency of segmentation results. Second, GAGS further decodes a granularity factor to guide the distillation process and this granularity factor can be learned in a unsupervised manner to only select the multiview consistent 2D features in the distillation process. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate significant performance and stability improvements of GAGS in visual grounding and semantic segmentation, with an inference speed 2$\times$ faster than baseline methods.

As commercial and gaming applications become pervasive, the need for the secure and convenient identification of users, often overlooked by the research in immersive media, is becoming more and more pressing. Networked scenarios such as Cloud gaming or cooperative virtual training and teleoperation require both a user-friendly and streamlined experience and user privacy and security. In this work, we investigate the possibility of identifying users from their movement patterns and data traffic traces while playing four commercial games, using a publicly available dataset. If, on the one hand, this paves the way for easy identification and automatic customization of the virtual reality content, it also represents a serious threat to users' privacy due to network analysis-based fingerprinting. Based on this, we analyze the threats and opportunities for virtual reality users' security and privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE VR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mixture-of-Mamba: Enhancing Multi-Modal State-Space Models with Modality-Aware Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16295v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequential modeling, but their inability to leverage modality-specific features limits their performance in multi-modal pretraining. Here, we propose Mixture-of-Mamba, a novel SSM architecture that introduces modality-aware sparsity through modality-specific parameterization of the Mamba block. Building on Mixture-of-Transformers (W. Liang et al. arXiv:2411.04996; 2024), we extend the benefits of modality-aware sparsity to SSMs while preserving their computational efficiency. We evaluate Mixture-of-Mamba across three multi-modal pretraining settings: Transfusion (interleaved text and continuous image tokens with diffusion loss), Chameleon (interleaved text and discrete image tokens), and an extended three-modality framework incorporating speech. Mixture-of-Mamba consistently reaches the same loss values at earlier training steps with significantly reduced computational costs. In the Transfusion setting, Mixture-of-Mamba achieves equivalent image loss using only 34.76% of the training FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. In the Chameleon setting, Mixture-of-Mamba reaches similar image loss with just 42.50% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale, and similar text loss with just 65.40% of the FLOPs. In the three-modality setting, MoM matches speech loss at 24.80% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. Our ablation study highlights the synergistic effects of decoupling projection components, where joint decoupling yields greater gains than individual modifications. These results establish modality-aware sparsity as a versatile and effective design principle, extending its impact from Transformers to SSMs and setting new benchmarks in multi-modal pretraining.

| **[UDBE: Unsupervised Diffusion-based Brightness Enhancement in Underwater Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16211v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activities in underwater environments are paramount in several scenarios, which drives the continuous development of underwater image enhancement techniques. A major challenge in this domain is the depth at which images are captured, with increasing depth resulting in a darker environment. Most existing methods for underwater image enhancement focus on noise removal and color adjustment, with few works dedicated to brightness enhancement. This work introduces a novel unsupervised learning approach to underwater image enhancement using a diffusion model. Our method, called UDBE, is based on conditional diffusion to maintain the brightness details of the unpaired input images. The input image is combined with a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation map (SNR) to ensure stable training and prevent color distortion in the output images. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate in the datasets UIEB, SUIM and RUIE, well-established underwater image benchmarks. Additionally, the experiments validate the robustness of our approach, regarding the image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, and UISM, indicating the good performance of the brightness enhancement process.

| **[A data-driven kinetic model for opinion dynamics with social network contacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00906v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Opinion dynamics is an important and very active area of research that delves into the complex processes through which individuals form and modify their opinions within a social context. The ability to comprehend and unravel the mechanisms that drive opinion formation is of great significance for predicting a wide range of social phenomena such as political polarization, the diffusion of misinformation, the formation of public consensus, and the emergence of collective behaviors. In this paper, we aim to contribute to that field by introducing a novel mathematical model that specifically accounts for the influence of social media networks on opinion dynamics. With the rise of platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and many others, social networks have become significant arenas where opinions are shared, discussed, and potentially altered. To this aim after an analytical construction of our new model and through incorporation of real-life data from Twitter, we calibrate the model parameters to accurately reflect the dynamics that unfold in social media, showing in particular the role played by the so-called influencers in driving individual opinions towards predetermined directions.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we present BAG, a Body-aligned Asset Generation method to output 3D wearable asset that can be automatically dressed on given 3D human bodies. This is achived by controlling the 3D generation process using human body shape and pose information. Specifically, we first build a general single-image to consistent multiview image diffusion model, and train it on the large Objaverse dataset to achieve diversity and generalizability. Then we train a Controlnet to guide the multiview generator to produce body-aligned multiview images. The control signal utilizes the multiview 2D projections of the target human body, where pixel values represent the XYZ coordinates of the body surface in a canonical space. The body-conditioned multiview diffusion generates body-aligned multiview images, which are then fed into a native 3D diffusion model to produce the 3D shape of the asset. Finally, by recovering the similarity transformation using multiview silhouette supervision and addressing asset-body penetration with physics simulators, the 3D asset can be accurately fitted onto the target human body. Experimental results demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods in terms of image prompt-following capability, shape diversity, and shape quality.

Given the complexity of their neural network structure, the convergence speed is still limited compared to numerical methods, mainly when used in applications that model realistic systems. The network initialization follows a random distribution of the initial weights, as in the case of traditional neural networks, which could lead to severe model convergence bottlenecks. To overcome this problem, we follow current studies that deal with optimal initial weights in traditional neural networks. In this paper, we use a convex optimization model to improve the initialization of the weights in PINNs and accelerate convergence. We investigate two optimization models as a first training step, defined as pre-training, one involving only the boundaries and one including physics. The optimization is focused on the first layer of the neural network part of the PINN model, while the other weights are randomly initialized. We test the methods using a practical application of the heat diffusion equation to model the temperature distribution of power transformers. The PINN model with boundary pre-training is the fastest converging method at the current stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Portrait Matte Creation With Layer Diffusion and Connectivity Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16147v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective deep portrait matting models requires training data of both high quality and large quantity. Neither quality nor quantity can be easily met for portrait matting, however. Since the most accurate ground-truth portrait mattes are acquired in front of the green screen, it is almost impossible to harvest a large-scale portrait matting dataset in reality. This work shows that one can leverage text prompts and the recent Layer Diffusion model to generate high-quality portrait foregrounds and extract latent portrait mattes. However, the portrait mattes cannot be readily in use due to significant generation artifacts. Inspired by the connectivity priors observed in portrait images, that is, the border of portrait foregrounds always appears connected, a connectivity-aware approach is introduced to refine portrait mattes. Building on this, a large-scale portrait matting dataset is created, termed LD-Portrait-20K, with $20,051$ portrait foregrounds and high-quality alpha mattes. Extensive experiments demonstrated the value of the LD-Portrait-20K dataset, with models trained on it significantly outperforming those trained on other datasets. In addition, comparisons with the chroma keying algorithm and an ablation study on dataset capacity further confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed matte creation approach. Further, the dataset also contributes to state-of-the-art video portrait matting, implemented by simple video segmentation and a trimap-based image matting model trained on this dataset.</p></details> |  |

Four generative models, including a standard GAN, a WGAN-GP, a U-net diffusion model, and a diffusion-GAN were assessed based on their ability to replicate spatial and statistical characteristics of windstorms. Different models have distinct strengths and limitations. The standard GAN displayed broader variability and limited alignment on the PCA dimensions. The WGAN-GP had a more balanced performance but occasionally misrepresented extreme events. The U-net diffusion model produced high-quality spatial patterns but consistently underestimated windstorm intensities. The diffusion-GAN performed better than the other models in general but overestimated extremes. An ensemble approach combining the strengths of these models could potentially improve their overall reliability. This study provides a foundation for such generative models in meteorological research and could potentially be applied in windstorm analysis and risk assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables.

| **[Improving Tropical Cyclone Forecasting With Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16003v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.

| **[MatCLIP: Light- and Shape-Insensitive Assignment of PBR Material Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15981v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assigning realistic materials to 3D models remains a significant challenge in computer graphics. We propose MatCLIP, a novel method that extracts shape- and lighting-insensitive descriptors of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials to assign plausible textures to 3D objects based on images, such as the output of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) or photographs. Matching PBR materials to static images is challenging because the PBR representation captures the dynamic appearance of materials under varying viewing angles, shapes, and lighting conditions. By extending an Alpha-CLIP-based model on material renderings across diverse shapes and lighting, and encoding multiple viewing conditions for PBR materials, our approach generates descriptors that bridge the domains of PBR representations with photographs or renderings, including LDM outputs. This enables consistent material assignments without requiring explicit knowledge of material relationships between different parts of an object. MatCLIP achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 76.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as PhotoShape and MatAtlas by over 15 percentage points on publicly available datasets. Our method can be used to construct material assignments for 3D shape datasets such as ShapeNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Objaverse. All code and data will be released.</p></details> | Preprint, 10 pages |
| **[Textualize Visual Prompt for Image Editing via Diffusion Bridge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03495v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prompt, a pair of before-and-after edited images, can convey indescribable imagery transformations and prosper in image editing. However, current visual prompt methods rely on a pretrained text-guided image-to-image generative model that requires a triplet of text, before, and after images for retraining over a text-to-image model. Such crafting triplets and retraining processes limit the scalability and generalization of editing. In this paper, we present a framework based on any single text-to-image model without reliance on the explicit image-to-image model thus enhancing the generalizability and scalability. Specifically, by leveraging the probability-flow ordinary equation, we construct a diffusion bridge to transfer the distribution between before-and-after images under the text guidance. By optimizing the text via the bridge, the framework adaptively textualizes the editing transformation conveyed by visual prompts into text embeddings without other models. Meanwhile, we introduce differential attention control during text optimization, which disentangles the text embedding from the invariance of the before-and-after images and makes it solely capture the delicate transformation and generalize to edit various images. Experiments on real images validate competitive results on the generalization, contextual coherence, and high fidelity for delicate editing with just one image pair as the visual prompt.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[EDSep: An Effective Diffusion-Based Method for Speech Source Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15965v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have attracted considerable attention for speech separation tasks, and among these, diffusion-based methods are being explored. Despite the notable success of diffusion techniques in generation tasks, their adaptation to speech separation has encountered challenges, notably slow convergence and suboptimal separation outcomes. To address these issues and enhance the efficacy of diffusion-based speech separation, we introduce EDSep, a novel single-channel method grounded in score matching via stochastic differential equation (SDE). This method enhances generative modeling for speech source separation by optimizing training and sampling efficiency. Specifically, a novel denoiser function is proposed to approximate data distributions, which obtains ideal denoiser outputs. Additionally, a stochastic sampler is carefully designed to resolve the reverse SDE during the sampling process, gradually separating speech from mixtures. Extensive experiments on databases such as WSJ0-2mix, LRS2-2mix, and VoxCeleb2-2mix demonstrate our proposed method's superior performance over existing diffusion and discriminative models, validating its efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion based Text-to-Music Generation with Global and Local Text based Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14680v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion based Text-To-Music (TTM) models generate music corresponding to text descriptions. Typically UNet based diffusion models condition on text embeddings generated from a pre-trained large language model or from a cross-modality audio-language representation model. This work proposes a diffusion based TTM, in which the UNet is conditioned on both (i) a uni-modal language model (e.g., T5) via cross-attention and (ii) a cross-modal audio-language representation model (e.g., CLAP) via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). The diffusion model is trained to exploit both a local text representation from the T5 and a global representation from the CLAP. Furthermore, we propose modifications that extract both global and local representations from the T5 through pooling mechanisms that we call mean pooling and self-attention pooling. This approach mitigates the need for an additional encoder (e.g., CLAP) to extract a global representation, thereby reducing the number of model parameters. Our results show that incorporating the CLAP global embeddings to the T5 local embeddings enhances text adherence (KL=1.47) compared to a baseline model solely relying on the T5 local embeddings (KL=1.54). Alternatively, extracting global text embeddings directly from the T5 local embeddings through the proposed mean pooling approach yields superior generation quality (FAD=1.89) while exhibiting marginally inferior text adherence (KL=1.51) against the model conditioned on both CLAP and T5 text embeddings (FAD=1.94 and KL=1.47). Our proposed solution is not only efficient but also compact in terms of the number of parameters required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

The heart of our method consists into approaching these scores via a computationally cheap estimator and relating the variance of this estimator to the smoothness properties of the forward process. Under the assumption that the density to sample from is $L$-log-smooth and that the forward process is semi-log-concave: $-\nabla^2 \log(p_t) \succeq -\beta I_d$ for some $\beta \geq 0$, we prove that our algorithm achieves an expected $\epsilon$ error in $\text{KL}$ divergence in $O(d^7(L+\beta)^2L^{d+2}\epsilon^{-2(d+3)}(d+m_2(\mu))^{2(d+1)})$ time with $m_2(\mu)$ the second order moment of $\mu$. In particular, our result allows to fully transfer the problem of sampling from a log-smooth distribution into a regularity estimate problem. As an application, we derive an exponential complexity improvement for the problem of sampling from an $L$-log-smooth distribution that is $\alpha$-strongly log-concave outside some ball of radius $R$: after proving that such distributions verify the semi-log-concavity assumption, a result which might be of independent interest, we recover a $poly(R, L, \alpha^{-1}, \epsilon^{-1})$ complexity in fixed dimension which exponentially improves upon the previously known $poly(e^{LR^2}, L,\alpha^{-1}, \log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ complexity in the low precision regime.</p></details> |  |

We assume that the diffusion process X is observed at discrete times, at high frequency, which means that the time step tends toward zero. In addition, the drift and diffusion coefficients of the process X are assumed to be unknown. In this paper, we study the minimax rates of convergence of the nonparametric estimators of the square of the diffusion coefficient. Two observation schemes are considered depending on the estimation interval. The square of the diffusion coefficient is estimated on the real line from repeated observations of the process X, where the number of diffusion paths tends to infinity. For the case of a compact estimation interval, we study the nonparametric estimation of the square of the diffusion coefficient constructed from a single diffusion path on one side and from repeated observations on the other side, where the number of trajectories tends to infinity. In each of these cases, we establish minimax convergence rates of the risk of estimation of the diffusion coefficient over a space of Holder functions.</p></details> | 32 pages |

This theory is particularly valuable in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based low-altitude economy (LAE) networking scenarios, where it could effectively address inherent challenges of dynamic network conditions, multiple optimization objectives, and stability requirements. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered significant attention for its unprecedented capability to generate diverse digital content. Extending beyond content generation, in this paper, we propose a framework integrating generative diffusion models with reinforcement learning to address Lyapunov optimization problems in UAV-based LAE networking. We begin by introducing the fundamentals of Lyapunov optimization theory and analyzing the limitations of both conventional methods and traditional AI-enabled approaches. We then examine various GenAI models and comprehensively analyze their potential contributions to Lyapunov optimization. Subsequently, we develop a Lyapunov-guided generative diffusion model-based reinforcement learning framework and validate its effectiveness through a UAV-based LAE networking case study.

We assume that the drift and diffusion coefficients are unknown as well as the law of the discrete random variable that models the class. In this paper, we study the minimax convergence rate of the resulting nonparametric plug-in classifier under different sets of assumptions on the mixture model considered. As the plug-in classifier is based on nonparametric estimators of the coefficients of the mixture model, we also provide a minimax convergence rate of the risk of estimation of the drift coefficients on the real line.</p></details> | 36 pages |

Then, we design a quantized predictor-based feedback mechanism that employs a dynamic switching strategy to adjust the quantization range and error over time. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven properly combining backstepping with a small-gain approach and input-to-state stability techniques, for deriving estimates on solutions, despite the quantization effect and the system's instability.

| **[Towards Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion for Regional Sea-Level Data Downscaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15628v3)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given coarser-resolution projections from global climate models or satellite data, the downscaling problem aims to estimate finer-resolution regional climate data, capturing fine-scale spatial patterns and variability. Downscaling is any method to derive high-resolution data from low-resolution variables, often to provide more detailed and local predictions and analyses. This problem is societally crucial for effective adaptation, mitigation, and resilience against significant risks from climate change. The challenge arises from spatial heterogeneity and the need to recover finer-scale features while ensuring model generalization. Most downscaling methods \cite{Li2020} fail to capture the spatial dependencies at finer scales and underperform on real-world climate datasets, such as sea-level rise. We propose a novel Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Ki-CDPM) to capture spatial variability while preserving fine-scale features. Experimental results on climate data show that our proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art downscaling techniques.</p></details> |  |

| **[Transient Finite Element Simulation of Accelerator Magnets Using Thermal Thin Shell Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15871v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermal transient responses of superconducting magnets can be simulated using the finite element (FE) method. Some accelerator magnets use cables whose electric insulation is significantly thinner than the bare electric conductor. The FE discretisation of such geometries with high-quality meshes leads to many degrees of freedom. This increases the computational time, particularly since non-linear material properties are involved. In this work, we propose to use a thermal thin-shell approximation (TSA) to improve the computational efficiency when solving the heat diffusion equation in two dimensions. We apply the method to compute the thermal transient response of superconducting accelerator magnets used for CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and High-Luminosity LHC. The TSA collapses thin electrical insulation layers into lines while accurately representing the thermal gradient across the insulation's thickness. The TSA is implemented in the multipole module of the open-source Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS), which can generate the multipole magnet models programmatically from input text files. First, the TSA approach is verified by comparison to classical FE simulations with meshed surface insulation regions for a simple block of four cables and a detailed model of the MBH dipole. The results show that the TSA approach reduces the computational time significantly while preserving the accuracy of the solution. Second, the quench heater (QH) delay computed with the TSA method is compared to measurements for the MBH magnet. To this end, the thermal transient simulation is coupled to a magnetostatic solution to account for magneto-resistive effects. Third, the TSA's full capabilities are showcased in non-linear magneto-thermal simulations of several LHC and HL-LHC superconducting magnet models. The full source code, including all input files, is publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the version of the article before peer review or editing, as submitted by an author to Superconductor Science and Technology</p></details> |

| **[Controllable Hand Grasp Generation for HOI and Efficient Evaluation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15839v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable affordance Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has become an increasingly important area of research in computer vision. In HOI generation, the hand grasp generation is a crucial step for effectively controlling the geometry of the hand. Current hand grasp generation methods rely on 3D information for both the hand and the object. In addition, these methods lack controllability concerning the hand's location and orientation. We treat the hand pose as the discrete graph structure and exploit the geometric priors. It is well established that higher order contextual dependency among the points improves the quality of the results in general. We propose a framework of higher order geometric representations (HOR's) inspired by spectral graph theory and vector algebra to improve the quality of generated hand poses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HOR's in devising a controllable novel diffusion method (based on 2D information) for hand grasp generation that outperforms the state of the art (SOTA). Overcoming the limitations of existing methods: like lacking of controllability and dependency on 3D information. Once we have the generated pose, it is very natural to evaluate them using a metric. Popular metrics like FID and MMD are biased and inefficient for evaluating the generated hand poses.

Our approach progressively generates textures that are consistent across multiple viewpoints with a depth-aware inpainting diffusion model, in an optimized sequence of viewpoints determined by an automatic view selection algorithm. A significant feature of our method is its remarkable efficiency, achieving a full texture generation within an end-to-end runtime of just 3.07 seconds on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, significantly outperforming existing methods. Such an acceleration is achieved by optimizations in the diffusion model and a specialized backprojection method. Moreover, our method reduces the artifacts in the backprojection phase, by selectively masking out non-frontal faces, and internal faces of open-surfaced objects. Experimental results demonstrate that Make-A-Texture matches or exceeds the quality of other state-of-the-art methods. Our work significantly improves the applicability and practicality of texture generation models for real-world 3D content creation, including interactive creation and text-guided texture editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025 Webpage: https://mukosame.github.io/make-a-texture/ Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ctqdx1uaj0</p></details> |

Existing approaches tend to leverage the pocket structure of the target protein to condition the molecule generation. However, even the pocket area of the target protein may contain redundant information since not all atoms in the pocket is responsible for the interaction with the ligand. In this work, we propose PharmacoBridge, a phamacophore-guided de novo design approach to generate drug candidates inducing desired bioactivity via diffusion bridge. Our method adapts the diffusion bridge to effectively convert pharmacophore arrangements in the spatial space into molecular structures under the manner of SE(3)-equivariant transformation, providing sophisticated control over optimal biochemical feature arrangements on the generated molecules. PharmacoBridge is demonstrated to generate hit candidates that exhibit high binding affinity with potential protein targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Memorization and Regularization in Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15785v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling. At the heart of the methodology is score matching: learning gradients of families of log-densities for noisy versions of the data distribution at different scales. When the loss function adopted in score matching is evaluated using empirical data, rather than the population loss, the minimizer corresponds to the score of a time-dependent Gaussian mixture. However, use of this analytically tractable minimizer leads to data memorization: in both unconditioned and conditioned settings, the generative model returns the training samples. This paper contains an analysis of the dynamical mechanism underlying memorization. The analysis highlights the need for regularization to avoid reproducing the analytically tractable minimizer; and, in so doing, lays the foundations for a principled understanding of how to regularize. Numerical experiments investigate the properties of: (i) Tikhonov regularization; (ii) regularization designed to promote asymptotic consistency; and (iii) regularizations induced by under-parameterization of a neural network or by early stopping when training a neural network. These experiments are evaluated in the context of memorization, and directions for future development of regularization are highlighted.</p></details> | 58 pages, 20 figures |

By increasing the number of diffusion steps, we show our finetuned models achieve monotonically increasing accuracy, directly translating to improved performance across downstream tasks. Furthermore, our finetuned models can expertly answer questions on specific topics by integrating powerful guidance techniques, and autonomously determine the compute required for a given problem by leveraging adaptive ODE solvers. Our method is universally applicable to any foundation model pre-trained with a cross-entropy loss and does not modify any of its original weights, fully preserving its strong single-step generation capabilities. We show our method is more effective and fully compatible with traditional finetuning approaches, introducing an orthogonal new direction to unify the strengths of the autoregressive and diffusion frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 19 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, there are concerns about the gender bias of these models. Previous studies have shown that T2I models can perpetuate or even amplify gender stereotypes when provided with neutral text prompts. Researchers have proposed automated gender bias uncovering detectors for T2I models, but a crucial gap exists: no existing work comprehensively compares the various detectors and understands how the gender bias detected by them deviates from the actual situation. This study addresses this gap by validating previous gender bias detectors using a manually labeled dataset and comparing how the bias identified by various detectors deviates from the actual bias in T2I models, as verified by manual confirmation. We create a dataset consisting of 6,000 images generated from three cutting-edge T2I models: Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Diffusion 3, and Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0. During the human-labeling process, we find that all three T2I models generate a portion (12.48% on average) of low-quality images (e.g., generate images with no face present), where human annotators cannot determine the gender of the person. Our analysis reveals that all three T2I models show a preference for generating male images, with SDXL being the most biased. Additionally, images generated using prompts containing professional descriptions (e.g., lawyer or doctor) show the most bias. We evaluate seven gender bias detectors and find that none fully capture the actual level of bias in T2I models, with some detectors overestimating bias by up to 26.95%. We further investigate the causes of inaccurate estimations, highlighting the limitations of detectors in dealing with low-quality images. Based on our findings, we propose an enhanced detector...</p></details> |  |

Despite the discovery of thousands of inscriptions, a vast expanse of OBS remains undeciphered, casting a veil of mystery over this ancient language. The emergence of modern AI technologies presents a novel frontier for OBS decipherment, challenging traditional NLP methods that rely heavily on large textual corpora, a luxury not afforded by historical languages. This paper introduces a novel approach by adopting image generation techniques, specifically through the development of Oracle Bone Script Decipher (OBSD). Utilizing a conditional diffusion-based strategy, OBSD generates vital clues for decipherment, charting a new course for AI-assisted analysis of ancient languages. To validate its efficacy, extensive experiments were conducted on an oracle bone script dataset, with quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of OBSD. Code and decipherment results will be made available at https://github.com/guanhaisu/OBSD.</p></details> | ACL 2024 Best Paper |

We formulate this problem as an image inpainting task, allowing for more user control over the placement of mirrors during the generation process. To enable this, we create SynMirror, a large-scale dataset of diverse synthetic scenes with objects placed in front of mirrors. SynMirror contains around 198k samples rendered from 66k unique 3D objects, along with their associated depth maps, normal maps and instance-wise segmentation masks, to capture relevant geometric properties of the scene. Using this dataset, we propose a novel depth-conditioned inpainting method called MirrorFusion, which generates high-quality, realistic, shape and appearance-aware reflections of real-world objects. MirrorFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SynMirror, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully tackle the challenging problem of generating controlled and faithful mirror reflections of an object in a scene using diffusion-based models. SynMirror and MirrorFusion open up new avenues for image editing and augmented reality applications for practitioners and researchers alike.

Recent advances in generative models, including diffusion models and geometric deep learning, have demonstrated promise in optimizing ligand generation. However, the scarcity of high-quality protein-ligand complex data and the inherent challenges in aligning generated ligands with target proteins limit the effectiveness of these methods. We propose BoKDiff, a novel framework that enhances ligand generation by combining multi-objective optimization and Best-of-K alignment methodologies. Built upon the DecompDiff model, BoKDiff generates diverse candidates and ranks them using a weighted evaluation of molecular properties such as QED, SA, and docking scores. To address alignment challenges, we introduce a method that relocates the center of mass of generated ligands to their docking poses, enabling accurate sub-component extraction. Additionally, we integrate a Best-of-N (BoN) sampling approach, which selects the optimal ligand from multiple generated candidates without requiring fine-tuning. BoN achieves exceptional results, with QED values exceeding 0.6, SA scores above 0.75, and a success rate surpassing 35%, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality. BoKDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on the CrossDocked2020 dataset, including a -8.58 average Vina docking score and a 26% success rate in molecule generation. This study is the first to apply Best-of-K alignment and Best-of-N sampling to SBDD, highlighting their potential to bridge generative modeling with practical drug discovery requirements.

In this paper, we present IPVTON, a novel image-based 3D virtual try-on framework. IPVTON employs score distillation sampling with image prompts to optimize a hybrid 3D human representation, integrating target garment features into diffusion priors through an image prompt adapter. To avoid interference with non-target areas, we leverage mask-guided image prompt embeddings to focus the image features on the try-on regions. Moreover, we impose geometric constraints on the 3D model with a pseudo silhouette generated by ControlNet, ensuring that the clothed 3D human model retains the shape of the source identity while accurately wearing the target garments. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that IPVTON outperforms previous methods in image-based 3D virtual try-on tasks, excelling in both geometry and texture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closed-Form Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12395v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based generative models (SGMs) sample from a target distribution by iteratively transforming noise using the score function of the perturbed target. For any finite training set, this score function can be evaluated in closed form, but the resulting SGM memorizes its training data and does not generate novel samples. In practice, one approximates the score by training a neural network via score-matching. The error in this approximation promotes generalization, but neural SGMs are costly to train and sample, and the effective regularization this error provides is not well-understood theoretically. In this work, we instead explicitly smooth the closed-form score to obtain an SGM that generates novel samples without training. We analyze our model and propose an efficient nearest-neighbor-based estimator of its score function. Using this estimator, our method achieves competitive sampling times while running on consumer-grade CPUs.</p></details> | Under review |

ST is a time-consuming, expensive yet powerful experimental technique that provides new opportunities to understand cancer mechanisms at a fine-grained molecular level, which is critical for uncovering new approaches for disease diagnosis and treatments. Here, we present $\textbf{Stem}$ ($\textbf{S}$pa$\textbf{T}$ially resolved gene $\textbf{E}$xpression inference with diffusion $\textbf{M}$odel), a novel computational tool that leverages a conditional diffusion generative model to enable in silico gene expression inference from H&E stained images. Through better capturing the inherent stochasticity and heterogeneity in ST data, $\textbf{Stem}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial gene expression prediction and generates biologically meaningful gene profiles for new H&E stained images at test time. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on datasets with various tissue sources and sequencing platforms, where it demonstrates clear improvement over existing approaches. $\textbf{Stem}$ generates high-fidelity gene expression predictions that share similar gene variation levels as ground truth data, suggesting that our method preserves the underlying biological heterogeneity. Our proposed pipeline opens up the possibility of analyzing existing, easily accessible H&E stained histology images from a genomics point of view without physically performing gene expression profiling and empowers potential biological discovery from H&E stained histology images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods often struggle with cultural bias, limited scalability, and alignment between textual prompts and generated visuals, particularly under weak supervision. In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to address these challenges. Our method leverages LLMs for semantic refinement of textual prompts and introduces a weak supervision filtering module to effectively utilize noisy or weakly labeled data. By fine-tuning the LDM on an enhanced DeepFashion+ dataset enriched with global fashion styles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and higher Inception Scores (IS), while human evaluations confirm its ability to generate culturally diverse and semantically relevant fashion content. These results highlight the potential of LLM-guided diffusion models in driving scalable and inclusive AI-driven fashion innovation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Planning for Autonomous Driving with Flexible Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15564v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving human-like driving behaviors in complex open-world environments is a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Contemporary learning-based planning approaches such as imitation learning methods often struggle to balance competing objectives and lack of safety assurance,due to limited adaptability and inadequacy in learning complex multi-modal behaviors commonly exhibited in human planning, not to mention their strong reliance on the fallback strategy with predefined rules. We propose a novel transformer-based Diffusion Planner for closed-loop planning, which can effectively model multi-modal driving behavior and ensure trajectory quality without any rule-based refinement. Our model supports joint modeling of both prediction and planning tasks under the same architecture, enabling cooperative behaviors between vehicles. Moreover, by learning the gradient of the trajectory score function and employing a flexible classifier guidance mechanism, Diffusion Planner effectively achieves safe and adaptable planning behaviors. Evaluations on the large-scale real-world autonomous planning benchmark nuPlan and our newly collected 200-hour delivery-vehicle driving dataset demonstrate that Diffusion Planner achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance with robust transferability in diverse driving styles.</p></details> |  |

With the limitation of privacy and safety in practice, the generative capability concerning NSFW (Not Safe For Work) concepts is undesirable, e.g., producing sexually explicit photos, and licensed images. The concept erasure task for T2I diffusion models has attracted considerable attention and requires an effective and efficient method. To achieve this goal, we propose a CE-SDWV framework, which removes the target concepts (e.g., NSFW concepts) of T2I diffusion models in the text semantic space by only adjusting the text condition tokens and does not need to re-train the original T2I diffusion model's weights. Specifically, our framework first builds a target concept-related word vocabulary to enhance the representation of the target concepts within the text semantic space, and then utilizes an adaptive semantic component suppression strategy to ablate the target concept-related semantic information in the text condition tokens. To further adapt the above text condition tokens to the original image semantic space, we propose an end-to-end gradient-orthogonal token optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on I2P and UnlearnCanvas benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> | 24 pages, 15 figures |

However, these studies fail to consider the impact of noisy samples in the training data, which results in diminished generalization capabilities and lower accuracy. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, this paper reveals that current DRO-based graph recommendation methods assign greater weight to noise distribution, leading to model parameter learning being dominated by it. When the model overly focuses on fitting noise samples in the training data, it may learn irrelevant or meaningless features that cannot be generalized to OOD data. To address this challenge, we design a Distributionally Robust Graph model for OOD recommendation (DRGO). Specifically, our method first employs a simple and effective diffusion paradigm to alleviate the noisy effect in the latent space. Additionally, an entropy regularization term is introduced in the DRO objective function to avoid extreme sample weights in the worst-case distribution. Finally, we provide a theoretical proof of the generalization error bound of DRGO as well as a theoretical analysis of how our approach mitigates noisy sample effects, which helps to better understand the proposed framework from a theoretical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework against three typical distribution shifts, and the results demonstrate its superiority in both independently and identically distributed distributions (IID) and OOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, Accepted by WWW'25</p></details> |

The trained LoRA matrix can be integrated with the base model through addition or negation operation to improve performance on downstream tasks. However, the unauthorized use of LoRAs to generate harmful content highlights the need for effective mechanisms to trace their usage. A natural solution is to embed watermarks into LoRAs to detect unauthorized misuse. However, existing methods struggle when multiple LoRAs are combined or negation operation is applied, as these can significantly degrade watermark performance. In this paper, we introduce LoRAGuard, a novel black-box watermarking technique for detecting unauthorized misuse of LoRAs. To support both addition and negation operations, we propose the Yin-Yang watermark technique, where the Yin watermark is verified during negation operation and the Yang watermark during addition operation. Additionally, we propose a shadow-model-based watermark training approach that significantly improves effectiveness in scenarios involving multiple integrated LoRAs. Extensive experiments on both language and diffusion models show that LoRAGuard achieves nearly 100% watermark verification success and demonstrates strong effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Item is Worth a Prompt: Versatile Image Editing with Disentangled Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04880v4)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building on the success of text-to-image diffusion models (DPMs), image editing is an important application to enable human interaction with AI-generated content. Among various editing methods, editing within the prompt space gains more attention due to its capacity and simplicity of controlling semantics. However, since diffusion models are commonly pretrained on descriptive text captions, direct editing of words in text prompts usually leads to completely different generated images, violating the requirements for image editing. On the other hand, existing editing methods usually consider introducing spatial masks to preserve the identity of unedited regions, which are usually ignored by DPMs and therefore lead to inharmonic editing results. Targeting these two challenges, in this work, we propose to disentangle the comprehensive image-prompt interaction into several item-prompt interactions, with each item linked to a special learned prompt. The resulting framework, named D-Edit, is based on pretrained diffusion models with cross-attention layers disentangled and adopts a two-step optimization to build item-prompt associations. Versatile image editing can then be applied to specific items by manipulating the corresponding prompts. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results in four types of editing operations including image-based, text-based, mask-based editing, and item removal, covering most types of editing applications, all within a single unified framework. Notably, D-Edit is the first framework that can (1) achieve item editing through mask editing and (2) combine image and text-based editing. We demonstrate the quality and versatility of the editing results for a diverse collection of images through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by WWW2025</p></details> |

However, generating high-quality content remains notably slow because it requires running model inference over many time steps. To accelerate these models, we propose to aggressively quantize both weights and activations, while simultaneously promoting significant activation sparsity. We further observe that the stated sparsity pattern varies among different channels and evolves across time steps. To support this quantization and sparsity scheme, we present a novel diffusion model accelerator featuring a heterogeneous mixed-precision dense-sparse architecture, channel-last address mapping, and a time-step-aware sparsity detector for efficient handling of the sparsity pattern. Our 4-bit quantization technique demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing 4-bit methods.

The zero-shot generation of various visual content using a pretrained image diffusion model has been explored mainly in two directions. First, Diffusion Synchronization-performing reverse diffusion processes jointly across different projected spaces while synchronizing them in the target space-generates high-quality outputs when enough conditioning is provided, but it struggles in its absence. Second, Score Distillation Sampling-gradually updating the target space data through gradient descent-results in better coherence but often lacks detail. In this paper, we reveal for the first time the interconnection between these two methods while highlighting their differences. To this end, we propose StochSync, a novel approach that combines the strengths of both, enabling effective performance with weak conditioning. Our experiments demonstrate that StochSync provides the best performance in 360{\deg} panorama generation (where image conditioning is not given), outperforming previous finetuning-based methods, and also delivers comparable results in 3D mesh texturing (where depth conditioning is provided) with previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://stochsync.github.io/ (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Current BFR methods have realized certain restored productions but with inherent neural degradations that limit real-world generalization in complicated scenarios. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework InfoBFR to tackle neural degradations, e.g., prior bias, topological distortion, textural distortion, and artifact residues, which achieves high-generalization face restoration in diverse wild and heterogeneous scenes. Specifically, based on the results from pre-trained BFR models, InfoBFR considers information compression using manifold information bottleneck (MIB) and information compensation with efficient diffusion LoRA to conduct information optimization. InfoBFR effectively synthesizes high-fidelity faces without attribute and identity distortions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of InfoBFR over state-of-the-art GAN-based and diffusion-based BFR methods, with around 70ms consumption, 16M trainable parameters, and nearly 85% BFR-boosting. It is promising that InfoBFR will be the first plug-and-play restorer universally employed by diverse BFR models to conquer neural degradations.</p></details> |  |

DSMs capture detailed elevations of natural and manmade features, crucial for applications like urban planning, vegetation studies, and 3D reconstruction. However, DSMs derived from stereo satellite imagery often contain voids or missing data due to occlusions, shadows, and lowsignal areas. Previous studies have primarily focused on void filling for digital elevation models (DEMs) and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), employing methods such as inverse distance weighting (IDW), kriging, and spline interpolation. While effective for simpler terrains, these approaches often fail to handle the intricate structures present in DSMs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dfilled, a guided DSM void filling method that leverages optical remote sensing images through edge-enhancing diffusion. Dfilled repurposes deep anisotropic diffusion models, which originally designed for super-resolution tasks, to inpaint DSMs. Additionally, we utilize Perlin noise to create inpainting masks that mimic natural void patterns in DSMs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Dfilled surpasses traditional interpolation methods and deep learning approaches in DSM void filling tasks. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the method's ability to manage complex features and deliver accurate, visually coherent results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision Workshops (WACVW)</p></details> |
| **[Visual Generation Without Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15420v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been a default technique in various visual generative models, yet it requires inference from both conditional and unconditional models during sampling. We propose to build visual models that are free from guided sampling. The resulting algorithm, Guidance-Free Training (GFT), matches the performance of CFG while reducing sampling to a single model, halving the computational cost. Unlike previous distillation-based approaches that rely on pretrained CFG networks, GFT enables training directly from scratch. GFT is simple to implement. It retains the same maximum likelihood objective as CFG and differs mainly in the parameterization of conditional models. Implementing GFT requires only minimal modifications to existing codebases, as most design choices and hyperparameters are directly inherited from CFG. Our extensive experiments across five distinct visual models demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GFT. Across domains of diffusion, autoregressive, and masked-prediction modeling, GFT consistently achieves comparable or even lower FID scores, with similar diversity-fidelity trade-offs compared with CFG baselines, all while being guidance-free. Code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/GFT.</p></details> |  |

By introducing a multi-layered diffusion process grounded in spectral analysis, it achieves a complex balance between global and local semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in perplexity and BLEU scores, emphasizing the mechanism's ability to adapt effectively across diverse domains, including multilingual and cross-domain text generation. A rigorous mathematical framework underpins the embedding diffusion process, incorporating weighted adjacency matrices, kernel-based refinements, and dynamic layer-wise normalization. Error distribution analysis reveals that SLED addresses challenges in semantic alignment and coherence, outperforming baseline approaches across varied benchmarks. Scalability studies illustrate that its performance gains are maintained consistently across different model sizes, reflecting a practical balance between computational efficiency and linguistic precision. The implementation also achieves energy efficiency, reducing resource consumption during training and inference phases without compromising accuracy. Qualitative case studies further validate its adaptability to extended narratives and context-intensive scenarios, highlighting the mechanism's potential for real-world applications. SLED offers a different perspective on embedding design and its implications for advancing language modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15393v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to address the critical issue of missing knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) for their better applications. However, both the previous MMGKC and negative sampling (NS) approaches ignore the employment of multimodal information to generate diverse and high-quality negative triples from various semantic levels and hardness levels, thereby limiting the effectiveness of training MMKGC models. Thus, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling (DHNS) scheme tailored for MMKGC tasks, which tackles the challenge of generating high-quality negative triples by leveraging a Diffusion-based Hierarchical Embedding Generation (DiffHEG) that progressively conditions on entities and relations as well as multimodal semantics. Furthermore, we develop a Negative Triple-Adaptive Training (NTAT) strategy that dynamically adjusts training margins associated with the hardness level of the synthesized negative triples, facilitating a more robust and effective learning procedure to distinguish between positive and negative triples. Extensive experiments on three MMKGC benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms several state-of-the-art MMKGC models and negative sampling techniques, illustrating the effectiveness of our DHNS for training MMKGC models.

With the latest advancements in controllable T2I diffusion models, increasing research has focused on rendering text within synthesized images. Despite improvements in text rendering accuracy, the field of automatic poster generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an automatic poster generation framework with text rendering capabilities leveraging LLMs, utilizing a triple-cross attention mechanism based on alignment learning. This framework aims to create precise poster text within a detailed contextual background. Additionally, the framework supports controllable fonts, adjustable image resolution, and the rendering of posters with descriptions and text in both English and Chinese.Furthermore, we introduce a high-resolution font dataset and a poster dataset with resolutions exceeding 1024 pixels. Our approach leverages the SDXL architecture. Extensive experiments validate our method's capability in generating poster images with complex and contextually rich backgrounds.Codes is available at https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/GlyphDraw2.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[Zero-Shot Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval via Diffusion-Augmented Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15379v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval (I-TIR) has emerged as a transformative user-interactive tool for applications in domains such as e-commerce and education. Yet, current methodologies predominantly depend on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which face two critical limitations: (1) Finetuning imposes prohibitive computational overhead and long-term maintenance costs. (2) Finetuning narrows the pretrained knowledge distribution of MLLMs, reducing their adaptability to novel scenarios. These issues are exacerbated by the inherently dynamic nature of real-world I-TIR systems, where queries and image databases evolve in complexity and diversity, often deviating from static training distributions. To overcome these constraints, we propose Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a paradigm-shifting framework that bypasses MLLM finetuning entirely. DAR synergizes Large Language Model (LLM)-guided query refinement with Diffusion Model (DM)-based visual synthesis to create contextually enriched intermediate representations. This dual-modality approach deciphers nuanced user intent more holistically, enabling precise alignment between textual queries and visually relevant images. Rigorous evaluations across four benchmarks reveal DAR's dual strengths: (1) Matches state-of-the-art finetuned I-TIR models on straightforward queries without task-specific training. (2) Scalable Generalization: Surpasses finetuned baselines by 7.61% in Hits@10 (top-10 accuracy) under multi-turn conversational complexity, demonstrating robustness to intricate, distributionally shifted interactions. By eliminating finetuning dependencies and leveraging generative-augmented representations, DAR establishes a new trajectory for efficient, adaptive, and scalable cross-modal retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |

However, solutions often use the standard albeit computationally intensive route of training and inferring with the whole image on the diffusion prior. While patch-based approaches to evaluating diffusion priors in plug-and-play methods have received some interest, they remain an open area of study. In this work, we explore the feasibility of the usage of patches for training and inference of a diffusion prior on MRI images. We explore the minor adaptation necessary for artifact avoidance, the performance and the efficiency of memory usage of patch-based methods as well as the adaptability of whole image training to patch-based evaluation - evaluating across multiple plug-and-play methods, tasks and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium for Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2025</p></details> |
| **[DiFaReli++: Diffusion Face Relighting with Consistent Cast Shadows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09479v4)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel approach to single-view face relighting in the wild, addressing challenges such as global illumination and cast shadows. A common scheme in recent methods involves intrinsically decomposing an input image into 3D shape, albedo, and lighting, then recomposing it with the target lighting. However, estimating these components is error-prone and requires many training examples with ground-truth lighting to generalize well. Our work bypasses the need for accurate intrinsic estimation and can be trained solely on 2D images without any light stage data, relit pairs, multi-view images, or lighting ground truth. Our key idea is to leverage a conditional diffusion implicit model (DDIM) for decoding a disentangled light encoding along with other encodings related to 3D shape and facial identity inferred from off-the-shelf estimators. We propose a novel conditioning technique that simplifies modeling the complex interaction between light and geometry. It uses a rendered shading reference along with a shadow map, inferred using a simple and effective technique, to spatially modulate the DDIM. Moreover, we propose a single-shot relighting framework that requires just one network pass, given pre-processed data, and even outperforms the teacher model across all metrics. Our method realistically relights in-the-wild images with temporally consistent cast shadows under varying lighting conditions. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark Multi-PIE and rank highest in user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>DiFaR...</summary><p>DiFaReli++ extends our previous work DiFaReli (ICCV 2023)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Point Clouds Upsampling via Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15286v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are a powerful framework for tackling ill-posed problems, with recent advancements extending their use to point cloud upsampling. Despite their potential, existing diffusion models struggle with inefficiencies as they map Gaussian noise to real point clouds, overlooking the geometric information inherent in sparse point clouds. To address these inefficiencies, we propose PUFM, a flow matching approach to directly map sparse point clouds to their high-fidelity dense counterparts. Our method first employs midpoint interpolation to sparse point clouds, resolving the density mismatch between sparse and dense point clouds. Since point clouds are unordered representations, we introduce a pre-alignment method based on Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) optimization to ensure coherent interpolation between sparse and dense point clouds, which enables a more stable learning path in flow matching. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior upsampling quality but with fewer sampling steps. Further experiments on ScanNet and KITTI also show that our approach generalizes well on RGB-D point clouds and LiDAR point clouds, making it more practical for real-world applications.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on the pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the spatial self-attention layer with the proposed short-long-range (SLR) temporal attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy to improve temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.

| **[Generalizable Deepfake Detection via Effective Local-Global Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15253v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of GANs and diffusion models has led to the generation of increasingly realistic fake images, posing significant hidden dangers and threats to society. Consequently, deepfake detection has become a pressing issue in today's world. While some existing methods focus on forgery features from either a local or global perspective, they often overlook the complementary nature of these features. Other approaches attempt to incorporate both local and global features but rely on simplistic strategies, such as cropping, which fail to capture the intricate relationships between local features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that effectively combines local spatial-frequency domain features with global frequency domain information, capturing detailed and holistic forgery traces. Specifically, our method uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and sliding windows to tile forged features and leverages attention mechanisms to extract local spatial-frequency domain information. Simultaneously, the phase component of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is integrated with attention mechanisms to extract global frequency domain information, complementing the local features and ensuring the integrity of forgery detection. Comprehensive evaluations on open-world datasets generated by 34 distinct generative models demonstrate a significant improvement of 2.9% over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | under review |

However, the availability of high-quality annotated ultrasound images is limited, which restricts the training of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models to generate synthetic ultrasound images to improve the performance on fetal plane classification. We train different classifiers first on synthetic images and then fine-tune them with real images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that incorporating generated images into training pipelines leads to better classification accuracy than training with real images alone. The findings suggest that generating synthetic data using diffusion models can be a valuable tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in ultrasound medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **["Stones from Other Hills can Polish Jade": Zero-shot Anomaly Image Synthesis via Cross-domain Anomaly Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15211v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial image anomaly detection (IAD) is a pivotal topic with huge value. Due to anomaly's nature, real anomalies in a specific modern industrial domain (i.e. domain-specific anomalies) are usually too rare to collect, which severely hinders IAD. Thus, zero-shot anomaly synthesis (ZSAS), which synthesizes pseudo anomaly images without any domain-specific anomaly, emerges as a vital technique for IAD. However, existing solutions are either unable to synthesize authentic pseudo anomalies, or require cumbersome training. Thus, we focus on ZSAS and propose a brand-new paradigm that can realize both authentic and training-free ZSAS. It is based on a chronically-ignored fact: Although domain-specific anomalies are rare, real anomalies from other domains (i.e. cross-domain anomalies) are actually abundant and directly applicable to ZSAS. Specifically, our new ZSAS paradigm makes three-fold contributions: First, we propose a novel method named Cross-domain Anomaly Injection (CAI), which directly exploits cross-domain anomalies to enable highly authentic ZSAS in a training-free manner. Second, to supply CAI with sufficient cross-domain anomalies, we build the first domain-agnostic anomaly dataset within our best knowledge, which provides ZSAS with abundant real anomaly patterns. Third, we propose a CAI-guided Diffusion Mechanism, which further breaks the quantity limit of real anomalies and enable unlimited anomaly synthesis. Our head-to-head comparison with existing ZSAS solutions justifies our paradigm's superior performance for IAD and demonstrates it as an effective and pragmatic ZSAS solution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Data Pruning in Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12523v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data pruning is the problem of identifying a core subset that is most beneficial to training and discarding the remainder. While pruning strategies are well studied for discriminative models like those used in classification, little research has gone into their application to generative models. Generative models aim to estimate the underlying distribution of the data, so presumably they should benefit from larger datasets. In this work we aim to shed light on the accuracy of this statement, specifically answer the question of whether data pruning for generative diffusion models could have a positive impact. Contrary to intuition, we show that eliminating redundant or noisy data in large datasets is beneficial particularly when done strategically. We experiment with several pruning methods including recent-state-of-art methods, and evaluate over CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. We demonstrate that a simple clustering method outperforms other sophisticated and computationally demanding methods. We further exhibit how we can leverage clustering to balance skewed datasets in an unsupervised manner to allow fair sampling for underrepresented populations in the data distribution, which is a crucial problem in generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffCom: Channel Received Signal is a Natural Condition to Guide Diffusion Posterior Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07390v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end visual communication systems typically optimize a trade-off between channel bandwidth costs and signal-level distortion metrics. However, under challenging physical conditions, this traditional coding and transmission paradigm often results in unrealistic reconstructions with perceptible blurring and aliasing artifacts, despite the inclusion of perceptual or adversarial losses for optimizing. This issue primarily stems from the receiver's limited knowledge about the underlying data manifold and the use of deterministic decoding mechanisms. To address these limitations, this paper introduces DiffCom, a novel end-to-end generative communication paradigm that utilizes off-the-shelf generative priors and probabilistic diffusion models for decoding, thereby improving perceptual quality without heavily relying on bandwidth costs and received signal quality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on deterministic decoders optimized solely for distortion metrics, our DiffCom leverages raw channel-received signal as a fine-grained condition to guide stochastic posterior sampling. Our approach ensures that reconstructions remain on the manifold of real data with a novel confirming constraint, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the generated outcomes. Furthermore, DiffCom incorporates a blind posterior sampling technique to address scenarios with unknown forward transmission characteristics. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate that DiffCom not only produces realistic reconstructions with details faithful to the original data but also achieves superior robustness against diverse wireless transmission degradations. Collectively, these advancements establish DiffCom as a new benchmark in designing generative communication systems that offer enhanced robustness and generalization superiorities.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications</p></details> |

Existing methods struggle to address the nuanced needs of non-expert users. We propose Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA), a novel framework that iteratively refines prompts and aligns generated images with user preferences. VCA employs a fine-tuned language model with reinforcement learning and multi-turn dialogues for prompt disambiguation. Key components include the Incremental Context-Enhanced Dialogue Block for interactive clarification, the Semantic Exploration and Disambiguation Module (SESD) leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and CLIP scoring, and the Pixel Precision and Consistency Optimization Module (PPCO) for refining image details using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). A human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism further improves performance. Experiments show that VCA surpasses models like DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, reducing dialogue rounds to 4.3, achieving a CLIP score of 0.92, and enhancing user satisfaction to 4.73/5. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-round dialogue dataset with prompt-image pairs and user intent annotations.</p></details> |  |

The time-changed process is defined by adjusting the speed of time of a base process via a user-chosen, state-dependent function. We apply this framework to several Markov processes from the MCMC literature, such as Langevin diffusions and piecewise deterministic Markov processes, obtaining novel modifications of classical algorithms and also re-discovering known MCMC algorithms. We prove theoretical properties of the time-changed process under suitable conditions on the base process, focusing on connecting the stationary distributions and qualitative convergence properties such as geometric and uniform ergodicity, as well as a functional central limit theorem. A comparison with the framework of space transformations is provided, clarifying the similarities between the approaches.

However, unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are computationally infeasible because of the high energy barriers that separate these states. Although recent machine learning techniques are proposed to sample rare events, they are often limited to simple systems and rely on collective variables (CVs) derived from costly domain expertise. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that trains diffusion path samplers (DPS) to address the transition path sampling (TPS) problem without requiring CVs. We reformulate the problem as an amortized sampling from the transition path distribution by minimizing the log-variance divergence between the path distribution induced by DPS and the transition path distribution. Based on the log-variance divergence, we propose learnable control variates to reduce the variance of gradient estimators and the off-policy training objective with replay buffers and simulated annealing techniques to improve sample efficiency and diversity. We also propose a scale-based equivariant parameterization of the bias forces to ensure scalability for large systems. We extensively evaluate our approach, termed TPS-DPS, on a synthetic system, small peptide, and challenging fast-folding proteins, demonstrating that it produces more realistic and diverse transition pathways than existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel, problem-agnostic diffusion model called the maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based guided term estimation method for inverse problems. We divide the conditional score function into two terms according to Bayes' rule: the unconditional score function and the guided term. We design the MAP-based guided term estimation method, while the unconditional score function is approximated by an existing score network. To estimate the guided term, we base on the assumption that the space of clean natural images is inherently smooth, and introduce a MAP estimate of the $t$-th latent variable. We then substitute this estimation into the expression of the inverse problem and obtain the approximation of the guided term. We evaluate our method extensively on super-resolution, inpainting, and denoising tasks, and demonstrate comparable performance to DDRM, DMPS, DPS and $\Pi$GDM.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Building upon the error estimation framework, we present a systematic procedure for constructing coarse propagators that enjoy desirable stability and consistent order. Additionally, we provide preliminary mathematical guarantees for the resulting parareal algorithm. Numerical experiments on a variety of settings, e.g., linear diffusion model, Allen-Cahn model, and viscous Burgers model, show that the optimizing procedure can significantly improve parallel efficiency when compared with the more ad hoc choice of some conventional and widely used coarse propagators.</p></details> | 26 pages |

However, constrained by the iterative denoising process that starts from pure noise, these methods are limited in both fidelity and efficiency. To address these two issues, we present Relay Residual Diffusion Extreme Image Compression (RDEIC), which leverages compressed feature initialization and residual diffusion. Specifically, we first use the compressed latent features of the image with added noise, instead of pure noise, as the starting point to eliminate the unnecessary initial stages of the denoising process. Second, we directly derive a novel residual diffusion equation from Stable Diffusion's original diffusion equation that reconstructs the raw image by iteratively removing the added noise and the residual between the compressed and target latent features. In this way, we effectively combine the efficiency of residual diffusion with the powerful generative capability of Stable Diffusion. Third, we propose a fixed-step fine-tuning strategy to eliminate the discrepancy between the training and inference phases, thereby further improving the reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RDEIC achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and outperforms existing diffusion-based extreme image compression methods in both fidelity and efficiency.

Among the various conditions of motion generation, text can describe motion details elaborately and is easy to acquire, making text-to-motion(T2M) generation important. State-of-the-art T2M techniques mainly leverage diffusion models to generate motions with text prompts as guidance, tackling the many-to-many nature of T2M tasks. However, existing T2M approaches face challenges, given the gap between the natural language domain and the physical domain, making it difficult to generate motions fully consistent with the texts. We leverage kinematic phrases(KP), an intermediate representation that bridges these two modalities, to solve this. Our proposed method, KETA, decomposes the given text into several decomposed texts via a language model. It trains an aligner to align decomposed texts with the KP segments extracted from the generated motions. Thus, it's possible to restrict the behaviors for diffusion-based T2M models. During the training stage, we deploy the text-KP alignment loss as an auxiliary goal to supervise the models. During the inference stage, we refine our generated motions for multiple rounds in our decoder structure, where we compute the text-KP distance as the guidance signal in each new round. Experiments demonstrate that KETA achieves up to 1.19x, 2.34x better R precision and FID value on both backbones of the base model, motion diffusion model. Compared to a wide range of T2M generation models. KETA achieves either the best or the second-best performance.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
