| **[One2Any: One-Reference 6D Pose Estimation for Any Object](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04109v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation remains challenging for many applications due to dependencies on complete 3D models, multi-view images, or training limited to specific object categories. These requirements make generalization to novel objects difficult for which neither 3D models nor multi-view images may be available. To address this, we propose a novel method One2Any that estimates the relative 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) object pose using only a single reference-single query RGB-D image, without prior knowledge of its 3D model, multi-view data, or category constraints. We treat object pose estimation as an encoding-decoding process, first, we obtain a comprehensive Reference Object Pose Embedding (ROPE) that encodes an object shape, orientation, and texture from a single reference view. Using this embedding, a U-Net-based pose decoding module produces Reference Object Coordinate (ROC) for new views, enabling fast and accurate pose estimation. This simple encoding-decoding framework allows our model to be trained on any pair-wise pose data, enabling large-scale training and demonstrating great scalability. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model generalizes well to novel objects, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness even rivaling methods that require multi-view or CAD inputs, at a fraction of compute.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Category-Level and Open-Set Object Pose Estimation for Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19572v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation enables a variety of tasks in computer vision and robotics, including scene understanding and robotic grasping. The complexity of a pose estimation task depends on the unknown variables related to the target object. While instance-level methods already excel for opaque and Lambertian objects, category-level and open-set methods, where texture, shape, and size are partially or entirely unknown, still struggle with these basic material properties. Since texture is unknown in these scenarios, it cannot be used for disambiguating object symmetries, another core challenge of 6D object pose estimation. The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of unknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions. This paper compares datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithms for solving 6D pose estimation on the category-level. Based on this comparison, we analyze how to bridge category-level and open-set object pose estimation to reach generalization and provide actionable recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Austrian Robotics Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[CordViP: Correspondence-based Visuomotor Policy for Dexterous Manipulation in Real-World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08449v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving human-level dexterity in robots is a key objective in the field of robotic manipulation. Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have shown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal. However, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems: (1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is significantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and occlusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack crucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations, we propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns correspondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and robot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware point clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand. These point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also incorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in six real-world tasks, surpassing other baselines by a large margin. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness of CordViP to different objects, viewpoints, and scenarios.

| **[BOP Challenge 2024 on Model-Based and Model-Free 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02812v4)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the evaluation methodology, datasets and results of the BOP Challenge 2024, the 6th in a series of public competitions organized to capture the state of the art in 6D object pose estimation and related tasks. In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have similar rankings on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21--29% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still -35% behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023), and the 2D detection stage is consequently the main bottleneck of existing pipelines for 6D localization/detection of unseen objects. The online evaluation system stays open and is available at http://bop.felk.cvut.cz/</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.09799</p></details> |
| **[ViTa-Zero: Zero-shot Visuotactile Object 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13179v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object 6D pose estimation is a critical challenge in robotics, particularly for manipulation tasks. While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[SCFlow2: Plug-and-Play Object Pose Refiner with Shape-Constraint Scene Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09160v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SCFlow2, a plug-and-play refinement framework for 6D object pose estimation. Most recent 6D object pose methods rely on refinement to get accurate results. However, most existing refinement methods either suffer from noises in establishing correspondences, or rely on retraining for novel objects. SCFlow2 is based on the SCFlow model designed for refinement with shape constraint, but formulates the additional depth as a regularization in the iteration via 3D scene flow for RGBD frames. The key design of SCFlow2 is an introduction of geometry constraints into the training of recurrent matching network, by combining the rigid-motion embeddings in 3D scene flow and 3D shape prior of the target. We train SCFlow2 on a combination of dataset Objaverse, GSO and ShapeNet, and evaluate on BOP datasets with novel objects. After using our method as a post-processing, most state-of-the-art methods produce significantly better results, without any retraining or fine-tuning. The source code is available at https://scflow2.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[6DOPE-GS: Online 6D Object Pose Estimation using Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01543v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and accurate object pose estimation is an essential component for modern vision systems in many applications such as Augmented Reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysPose: Refining 6D Object Poses with Physical Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23587v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D object pose estimation from images is a key problem in object-centric scene understanding, enabling applications in robotics, augmented reality, and scene reconstruction. Despite recent advances, existing methods often produce physically inconsistent pose estimates, hindering their deployment in real-world scenarios. We introduce PhysPose, a novel approach that integrates physical reasoning into pose estimation through a postprocessing optimization enforcing non-penetration and gravitational constraints. By leveraging scene geometry, PhysPose refines pose estimates to ensure physical plausibility. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the YCB-Video dataset from the BOP benchmark and improves over the state-of-the-art pose estimation methods on the HOPE-Video dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate its impact in robotics by significantly improving success rates in a challenging pick-and-place task, highlighting the importance of physical consistency in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://data.ciirc.cvut.cz/public/projects/2025PhysPose</p></details> |
| **[Vanishing Depth: A Depth Adapter with Positional Depth Encoding for Generalized Image Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19947v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized metric depth understanding is critical for precise vision-guided robotics, which current state-of-the-art (SOTA) vision-encoders do not support. To address this, we propose Vanishing Depth, a self-supervised training approach that extends pretrained RGB encoders to incorporate and align metric depth into their feature embeddings. Based on our novel positional depth encoding, we enable stable depth density and depth distribution invariant feature extraction. We achieve performance improvements and SOTA results across a spectrum of relevant RGBD downstream tasks - without the necessity of finetuning the encoder. Most notably, we achieve 56.05 mIoU on SUN-RGBD segmentation, 88.3 RMSE on Void's depth completion, and 83.8 Top 1 accuracy on NYUv2 scene classification. In 6D-object pose estimation, we outperform our predecessors of DinoV2, EVA-02, and Omnivore and achieve SOTA results for non-finetuned encoders in several related RGBD downstream tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Unlike existing methods that rely on textured 3D models or multiple viewpoints, Any6D leverages a joint object alignment process to enhance 2D-3D alignment and metric scale estimation for improved pose accuracy. Our approach integrates a render-and-compare strategy to generate and refine pose hypotheses, enabling robust performance in scenarios with occlusions, non-overlapping views, diverse lighting conditions, and large cross-environment variations. We evaluate our method on five challenging datasets: REAL275, Toyota-Light, HO3D, YCBINEOAT, and LM-O, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods for novel object pose estimation.

| **[GDRNPP: A Geometry-guided and Fully Learning-based Object Pose Estimator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12145v5)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D pose estimation of rigid objects is a long-standing and challenging task in computer vision. Recently, the emergence of deep learning reveals the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict reliable 6D poses. Given that direct pose regression networks currently exhibit suboptimal performance, most methods still resort to traditional techniques to varying degrees. For example, top-performing methods often adopt an indirect strategy by first establishing 2D-3D or 3D-3D correspondences followed by applying the RANSAC-based PnP or Kabsch algorithms, and further employing ICP for refinement. Despite the performance enhancement, the integration of traditional techniques makes the networks time-consuming and not end-to-end trainable. Orthogonal to them, this paper introduces a fully learning-based object pose estimator. In this work, we first perform an in-depth investigation of both direct and indirect methods and propose a simple yet effective Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDRN) to learn the 6D pose from monocular images in an end-to-end manner. Afterwards, we introduce a geometry-guided pose refinement module, enhancing pose accuracy when extra depth data is available. Guided by the predicted coordinate map, we build an end-to-end differentiable architecture that establishes robust and accurate 3D-3D correspondences between the observed and rendered RGB-D images to refine the pose. Our enhanced pose estimation pipeline GDRNPP (GDRN Plus Plus) conquered the leaderboard of the BOP Challenge for two consecutive years, becoming the first to surpass all prior methods that relied on traditional techniques in both accuracy and speed.

| **[Omni6D: Large-Vocabulary 3D Object Dataset for Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18261v3)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation aims at determining an object's translation, rotation, and scale, typically from a single RGBD image. Recent advancements have expanded this estimation from instance-level to category-level, allowing models to generalize across unseen instances within the same category. However, this generalization is limited by the narrow range of categories covered by existing datasets, such as NOCS, which also tend to overlook common real-world challenges like occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Omni6D, a comprehensive RGBD dataset featuring a wide range of categories and varied backgrounds, elevating the task to a more realistic context. 1) The dataset comprises an extensive spectrum of 166 categories, 4688 instances adjusted to the canonical pose, and over 0.8 million captures, significantly broadening the scope for evaluation. 2) We introduce a symmetry-aware metric and conduct systematic benchmarks of existing algorithms on Omni6D, offering a thorough exploration of new challenges and insights. 3) Additionally, we propose an effective fine-tuning approach that adapts models from previous datasets to our extensive vocabulary setting. We believe this initiative will pave the way for new insights and substantial progress in both the industrial and academic fields, pushing forward the boundaries of general 6D pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 (poster).

| **[LuciBot: Automated Robot Policy Learning from Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09871v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generating training supervision for embodied tasks is crucial, as manual designing is tedious and not scalable. While prior works use large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rewards, these approaches are largely limited to simple tasks with well-defined rewards, such as pick-and-place. This limitation arises because LLMs struggle to interpret complex scenes compressed into text or code due to their restricted input modality, while VLM-based rewards, though better at visual perception, remain limited by their less expressive output modality. To address these challenges, we leverage the imagination capability of general-purpose video generation models. Given an initial simulation frame and a textual task description, the video generation model produces a video demonstrating task completion with correct semantics. We then extract rich supervisory signals from the generated video, including 6D object pose sequences, 2D segmentations, and estimated depth, to facilitate task learning in simulation. Our approach significantly improves supervision quality for complex embodied tasks, enabling large-scale training in simulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal 3D Mesh Reconstruction from Images and Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07190v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation for unseen objects is essential in robotics but traditionally relies on trained models that require large datasets, high computational costs, and struggle to generalize. Zero-shot approaches eliminate the need for training but depend on pre-existing 3D object models, which are often impractical to obtain. To address this, we propose a language-guided few-shot 3D reconstruction method, reconstructing a 3D mesh from few input images. In the proposed pipeline, receives a set of input images and a language query. A combination of GroundingDINO and Segment Anything Model outputs segmented masks from which a sparse point cloud is reconstructed with VGGSfM. Subsequently, the mesh is reconstructed with the Gaussian Splatting method SuGAR. In a final cleaning step, artifacts are removed, resulting in the final 3D mesh of the queried object. We evaluate the method in terms of accuracy and quality of the geometry and texture. Furthermore, we study the impact of imaging conditions such as viewing angle, number of input images, and image overlap on 3D object reconstruction quality, efficiency, and computational scalability.</p></details> | under review |
| **[AxisPose: Model-Free Matching-Free Single-Shot 6D Object Pose Estimation via Axis Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06660v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation, which plays a vital role in robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving, has been of great interest in computer vision. Existing studies either require multi-stage pose regression or rely on 2D-3D feature matching. Though these approaches have shown promising results, they rely heavily on appearance information, requiring complex input (i.e., multi-view reference input, depth, or CAD models) and intricate pipeline (i.e., feature extraction-SfM-2D to 3D matching-PnP). We propose AxisPose, a model-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation, which fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing methods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM and PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by leveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects without reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation Module (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes through a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the gradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain the geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated tri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module (TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose achieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N instances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with great potential for generalization to unseen-object level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Object 6D Pose Estimation with a Single Reference View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05578v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing novel object 6D pose estimation methods typically rely on CAD models or dense reference views, which are both difficult to acquire. Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in the camera coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative camera-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting. Code will be released at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/SinRef-6D.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures (including supplementary material)</p></details> |
| **[Active 6D Pose Estimation for Textureless Objects using Multi-View RGB Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03726v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of textureless objects from RBG images is an important problem in robotics. Due to appearance ambiguities, rotational symmetries, and severe occlusions, single-view based 6D pose estimators are still unable to handle a wide range of objects, motivating research towards multi-view pose estimation and next-best-view prediction that addresses these limitations. In this work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for estimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our approach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a sequential two-step process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency. First, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth ambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify the subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through canonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then introduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera viewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty and enhancing pose accuracy. We evaluate our method on the public ROBI dataset as well as on a transparent object dataset that we created. When evaluated using the same camera viewpoints, our multi-view pose estimation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by leveraging our next-best-view strategy, our method achieves high object pose accuracy with substantially fewer viewpoints than heuristic-based policies.</p></details> |  |

We set out to improve the state-of-the-art by addressing challenges such as reflections and specular highlights in industrial applications. Our novel BOP-compatible dataset, featuring a diverse set of metallic objects (cans, household, and industrial items) under various lighting and background conditions, provides additional geometric and visual cues. We demonstrate that these cues can be effectively leveraged to enhance overall performance. To illustrate the usefulness of the additional features, we improve upon the GDRNPP algorithm by introducing an additional keypoint prediction and material estimator head in order to improve spatial scene understanding. Evaluations on the new dataset show improved accuracy for metallic objects, supporting the hypothesis that additional geometric and visual cues can improve learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Increasing the Task Flexibility of Heavy-Duty Manipulators Using Visual 6D Pose Estimation of Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19169v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in visual 6D pose estimation of objects using deep neural networks have enabled novel ways of vision-based control for heavy-duty robotic applications. In this study, we present a pipeline for the precise tool positioning of heavy-duty, long-reach (HDLR) manipulators using advanced machine vision. A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration to estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI). Based on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with motion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool positioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and control methods prevalent in the industry. The proposed methodology comprises orientation and position alignment based on the visually estimated OOI poses, whereas camera-to-robot calibration is conducted based on motion utilizing visual SLAM. The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from rigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via image-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation, only synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world setting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results demonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2 mm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to increase the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR manipulators.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances improving speed and accuracy in pose estimation, finding a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy poses significant challenges in dynamic environments. Most current algorithms lack scalability in estimation time, especially for diverse datasets, and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are often too slow. This study focuses on developing a fast and scalable set of pose estimators based on GDRNPP to meet or exceed current benchmarks in accuracy and robustness, particularly addressing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off essential in real-time scenarios. We propose the AMIS algorithm to tailor the utilized model according to an application-specific trade-off between inference time and accuracy. We further show the effectiveness of the AMIS-based model choice on four prominent benchmark datasets (LM-O, YCB-V, T-LESS, and ITODD).</p></details> |  |

However, the edges of clear objects have the highest contrast, which leads to stable and prominent features. We propose a novel approach by incorporating edge detection in a pre-processing step for the tasks of object detection and object pose estimation. We conducted experiments to investigate the effect of edge detectors on transparent objects. We examine the performance of the state-of-the-art 6D object pose estimation pipeline GDR-Net and the object detector YOLOX when applying different edge detectors as pre-processing steps (i.e., Canny edge detection with and without color information, and holistically-nested edges (HED)). We evaluate the physically-based rendered dataset Trans6D-32 K of transparent objects with parameters proposed by the BOP Challenge. Our results indicate that applying edge detection as a pre-processing enhances performance for certain objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at First Austrian Symposium on AI, Robotics, and Vision (AIROV 2024)</p></details> |
| **[HIPPo: Harnessing Image-to-3D Priors for Model-free Zero-shot 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10606v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on model-free zero-shot 6D object pose estimation for robotics applications. While existing methods can estimate the precise 6D pose of objects, they heavily rely on curated CAD models or reference images, the preparation of which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, 3D models or reference images may not be available in advance and instant robot reaction is desired. In this work, we propose a novel framework named HIPPo, which eliminates the need for curated CAD models and reference images by harnessing image-to-3D priors from Diffusion Models, enabling model-free zero-shot 6D pose estimation. Specifically, we construct HIPPo Dreamer, a rapid image-to-mesh model built on a multiview Diffusion Model and a 3D reconstruction foundation model. Our HIPPo Dreamer can generate a 3D mesh of any unseen objects from a single glance in just a few seconds. Then, as more observations are acquired, we propose to continuously refine the diffusion prior mesh model by joint optimization of object geometry and appearance. This is achieved by a measurement-guided scheme that gradually replaces the plausible diffusion priors with more reliable online observations. Consequently, HIPPo can instantly estimate and track the 6D pose of a novel object and maintain a complete mesh for immediate robotic applications. Thorough experiments on various benchmarks show that HIPPo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 6D object pose estimation when prior reference images are limited.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often struggle with achieving high accuracy in both object detection and precise pose estimation simultaneously. This study proposes an improved 6D object detection and pose estimation pipeline based on the existing 6D-VNet framework, enhanced by integrating a Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC) and a High-Resolution Network (HRNet) backbone. By leveraging the strengths of HTC's multi-stage refinement process and HRNet's ability to maintain high-resolution representations, our approach significantly improves detection accuracy and pose estimation precision. Furthermore, we introduce advanced post-processing techniques and a novel model integration strategy that collectively contribute to superior performance on public and private benchmarks.

Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve ambiguous cases due to geometrically symmetric objects that is based on visual features. We comprehensively evaluate FreeZe across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, which include over a hundred 3D objects and 20,000 images captured in various scenarios. FreeZe consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches, including competitors extensively trained on synthetic 6D pose estimation data.

Traditional methods often rely on deep learning with grid based data structures but struggle to capture complex dependencies among extracted features. To overcome this, we introduce a graph based representation derived directly from images, where spatial temporal features of each pixel serve as nodes, and relationships between them are defined through node connectivity and spatial interactions. We also employ feature selection mechanisms that use spatial attention and self attention distillation, along with a Legendre convolution layer leveraging the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials for numerical stability. Experiments on the LINEMOD, Occluded LINEMOD, and YCB Video datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms nine existing approaches and achieves state of the art benchmark in object pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, they present a major challenge due to their distinct refractive and reflective properties when it comes to accurately estimating the 6D pose. To solve this, we present ReFlow6D, a novel method for transparent object 6D pose estimation that harnesses the refractive-intermediate representation. Unlike conventional approaches, our method leverages a feature space impervious to changes in RGB image space and independent of depth information. Drawing inspiration from image matting, we model the deformation of the light path through transparent objects, yielding a unique object-specific intermediate representation guided by light refraction that is independent of the environment in which objects are observed. By integrating these intermediate features into the pose estimation network, we show that ReFlow6D achieves precise 6D pose estimation of transparent objects, using only RGB images as input. Our method further introduces a novel transparent object compositing loss, fostering the generation of superior refractive-intermediate features. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TOD and Trans32K-6D datasets. Robot grasping experiments further demonstrate that ReFlow6D's pose estimation accuracy effectively translates to real-world robotics task.

| **[Level-Set Parameters: Novel Representation for 3D Shape Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13502v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D shape analysis has been largely focused on traditional 3D representations of point clouds and meshes, but the discrete nature of these data makes the analysis susceptible to variations in input resolutions. Recent development of neural fields brings in level-set parameters from signed distance functions as a novel, continuous, and numerical representation of 3D shapes, where the shape surfaces are defined as zero-level-sets of those functions. This motivates us to extend shape analysis from the traditional 3D data to these novel parameter data. Since the level-set parameters are not Euclidean like point clouds, we establish correlations across different shapes by formulating them as a pseudo-normal distribution, and learn the distribution prior from the respective dataset. To further explore the level-set parameters with shape transformations, we propose to condition a subset of these parameters on rotations and translations, and generate them with a hypernetwork. This simplifies the pose-related shape analysis compared to using traditional data. We demonstrate the promise of the novel representations through applications in shape classification (arbitrary poses), retrieval, and 6D object pose estimation.

Existing real-world datasets primarily focus on table-top grasping scenarios, where a robot arm is placed in a fixed position and the objects are centralized within the FOV of fixed external camera(s). Assessing performance on such datasets may not accurately reflect the challenges encountered in everyday grasping and mobile manipulation tasks within kitchen environments such as retrieving objects from higher shelves, sinks, dishwashers, ovens, refrigerators, or microwaves. To address this gap, we present KITchen, a novel benchmark designed specifically for estimating the 6D poses of objects located in diverse positions within kitchen settings. For this purpose, we recorded a comprehensive dataset comprising around 205k real-world RGBD images for 111 kitchen objects captured in two distinct kitchens, utilizing a humanoid robot with its egocentric perspectives. Subsequently, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline, to streamline the labeling process of such datasets, resulting in the generation of 2D object labels, 2D object segmentation masks, and 6D object poses with minimal human effort. The benchmark, the dataset, and the annotation pipeline will be publicly available at https://kitchen-dataset.github.io/KITchen.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publishing at The 2024 IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots</p></details> |

Our approach relies on the evaluation of discrepancies in the geometry of the observed object, in particular its respective estimated back-projection in 3D, against a putative functional shape representation comprising mixtures of Gaussian Processes, that act as a template. Each Gaussian Process is trained to yield a fragment of the object's surface in a radial fashion with respect to designated reference points. We further define a pose confidence measure as the average probability of pixel back-projections in the Gaussian mixture. The goal of our experiments is two-fold. a) We demonstrate that our functional representation is sufficiently accurate as a shape template on which the probability of back-projected object points can be evaluated, and, b) we show that the resulting confidence scores based on these probabilities are indeed a consistent quality measure of pose.</p></details> |  |

Most current approaches are restricted to specific instances with known models or require ground truth depth information or point cloud captures from LIDAR. We tackle the harder problem of pose estimation for category-level objects from a single RGB image. We propose a novel solution that eliminates the need for specific object models or depth information. Our method utilises score-based diffusion models to generate object pose hypotheses to model the distribution of possible poses for the object. Unlike previous methods that rely on costly trained likelihood estimators to remove outliers before pose aggregation using mean pooling, we introduce a simpler approach using Mean Shift to estimate the mode of the distribution as the final pose estimate. Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the REAL275 dataset by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

It is particularly challenging in bin-picking applications, where objects may be textureless and in difficult poses, and occlusion between objects of the same type may cause confusion even in well-trained models. We propose a novel method of hard example synthesis that is model-agnostic, using existing simulators and the modeling of pose error in both the camera-to-object viewsphere and occlusion space. Through evaluation of the model performance with respect to the distribution of object poses and occlusions, we discover regions of high error and generate realistic training samples to specifically target these regions. With our training approach, we demonstrate an improvement in correct detection rate of up to 20% across several ROBI-dataset objects using state-of-the-art pose estimation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

In particular, partial observability, occlusions, and object symmetries eventually result in pose ambiguity. To account for this multimodality, this work proposes training a diffusion-based generative model for 6D object pose estimation. During inference, the trained generative model allows for sampling multiple particles, i.e., pose hypotheses. To distill this information into a single pose estimate, we propose two novel and effective pose selection strategies that do not require any additional training or computationally intensive operations. Moreover, while many existing methods for pose estimation primarily focus on the image domain and only incorporate depth information for final pose refinement, our model solely operates on point cloud data. The model thereby leverages recent advancements in point cloud processing and operates upon an SE(3)-equivariant latent space that forms the basis for the particle selection strategies and allows for improved inference times. Our thorough experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach on the Linemod dataset and showcase the effectiveness of our design choices.

Occlusion and incomplete object visibility are common challenges in this task, but existing pose refinement methods often struggle to handle these issues effectively. To tackle this problem, we propose a global motion-guided recurrent flow estimation method called GMFlow for pose estimation. GMFlow overcomes local ambiguities caused by occlusion or missing parts by seeking global explanations. We leverage the object's structural information to extend the motion of visible parts of the rigid body to its invisible regions. Specifically, we capture global contextual information through a linear attention mechanism and guide local motion information to generate global motion estimates. Furthermore, we introduce object shape constraints in the flow iteration process, making flow estimation suitable for pose estimation scenarios. Experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in accuracy while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GS2Pose: Two-stage 6D Object Pose Estimation Guided by Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03807v3)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a new method for accurate and robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects, named GS2Pose. By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose can utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD model, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input. Specifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse estimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight U-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is designed. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images. GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly competitive results. The code for GS2Pose will soon be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Existing 6D pose estimation networks are often too large for such deployments, necessitating compression while maintaining reliable performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Modular Quantization-Aware Training (MQAT), an adaptive and mixed-precision quantization-aware training strategy that exploits the modular structure of modern 6D pose estimation architectures. MQAT guides a systematic gradated modular quantization sequence and determines module-specific bit precisions, leading to quantized models that outperform those produced by state-of-the-art uniform and mixed-precision quantization techniques. Our experiments showcase the generality of MQAT across datasets, architectures, and quantization algorithms. Remarkably, MQAT-trained quantized models achieve a significant accuracy boost (>7%) over the baseline full-precision network while reducing model size by a factor of 4x or more.

| **[ZeroPose: CAD-Prompted Zero-shot Object 6D Pose Estimation in Cluttered Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17934v3)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robotics and industry applications have a high demand for the capability to estimate the 6D pose of novel objects from the cluttered scene. However, existing classic pose estimation methods are object-specific, which can only handle the specific objects seen during training. When applied to a novel object, these methods necessitate a cumbersome onboarding process, which involves extensive dataset preparation and model retraining. The extensive duration and resource consumption of onboarding limit their practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce ZeroPose, a novel zero-shot framework that performs pose estimation following a Discovery-Orientation-Registration (DOR) inference pipeline. This framework generalizes to novel objects without requiring model retraining. Given the CAD model of a novel object, ZeroPose enables in seconds onboarding time to extract visual and geometric embeddings from the CAD model as a prompt. With the prompting of the above embeddings, DOR can discover all related instances and estimate their 6D poses without additional human interaction or presupposing scene conditions. Compared with existing zero-shot methods solved by the render-and-compare paradigm, the DOR pipeline formulates the object pose estimation into a feature-matching problem, which avoids time-consuming online rendering and improves efficiency. Experimental results on the seven datasets show that ZeroPose as a zero-shot method achieves comparable performance with object-specific training methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot method with 50x inference speed improvement.</p></details> |  |

This problem is of particular interest for many practical applications in industrial tasks such as quality control, bin picking, and robotic manipulation, where both speed and accuracy are critical for real-world deployment. Current models, both classical and deep-learning-based, often struggle with the trade-off between accuracy and latency. Our research focuses on enhancing the speed of a prominent state-of-the-art deep learning model, GDRNPP, while keeping its high accuracy. We employ several techniques to reduce the model size and improve inference time. These techniques include using smaller and quicker backbones, pruning unnecessary parameters, and distillation to transfer knowledge from a large, high-performing model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed configuration maintains accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art while significantly improving inference time.

State-of-the-art 6D object pose estimators directly predict an object pose given an object observation. Due to the ill-posed nature of the pose estimation problem, where multiple different poses can correspond to a single observation, generating additional plausible estimates per observation can be valuable. To address this, we reformulate the state-of-the-art algorithm GDRNPP and introduce EPRO-GDR (End-to-End Probabilistic Geometry-Guided Regression). Instead of predicting a single pose per detection, we estimate a probability density distribution of the pose. Using the evaluation procedure defined by the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) Challenge, we test our approach on four of its core datasets and demonstrate superior quantitative results for EPRO-GDR on LM-O, YCB-V, and ITODD. Our probabilistic solution shows that predicting a pose distribution instead of a single pose can improve state-of-the-art single-view pose estimation while providing the additional benefit of being able to sample multiple meaningful pose candidates.</p></details> |  |

In this context, RGB image and point-cloud observations are two commonly used modalities in visual-based robotic manipulation, but each of these modalities have their own limitations. Commercial point-cloud observations often suffer from issues like sparse sampling and noisy output due to the limits of the emission-reception imaging principle. On the other hand, RGB images, while rich in texture information, lack essential depth and 3D information crucial for robotic manipulation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an image-only robotic manipulation framework that leverages an eye-on-hand monocular camera installed on the robot's parallel gripper. By moving with the robot gripper, this camera gains the ability to actively perceive object from multiple perspectives during the manipulation process. This enables the estimation of 6D object poses, which can be utilized for manipulation. While, obtaining images from more and diverse viewpoints typically improves pose estimation, it also increases the manipulation time. To address this trade-off, we employ a reinforcement learning policy to synchronize the manipulation strategy with active perception, achieving a balance between 6D pose accuracy and manipulation efficiency. Our experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments showcase the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our approach. %, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve robust real-world robotic manipulation through active pose estimation.

To detect and grasp novel objects, zero-shot pose estimators determine poses without prior knowledge. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have shown considerable advances in robotics applications by establishing an understanding between language input and image input. In our work, we take advantage of VLMs zero-shot capabilities and translate this ability to 6D object pose estimation. We propose a novel framework for promptable zero-shot 6D object pose estimation using language embeddings. The idea is to derive a coarse location of an object based on the relevancy map of a language-embedded NeRF reconstruction and to compute the pose estimate with a point cloud registration method. Additionally, we provide an analysis of LERF's suitability for open-set object pose estimation. We examine hyperparameters, such as activation thresholds for relevancy maps and investigate the zero-shot capabilities on an instance- and category-level.

Object 3D reconstruction methods offer an alternative, among which recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) afford a compelling potential. Yet its performance still suffers and tends to overfit with fewer input views. Embracing this challenge, we introduce SGPose, a novel framework for sparse view object pose estimation using Gaussian-based methods. Given as few as ten views, SGPose generates a geometric-aware representation by starting with a random cuboid initialization, eschewing reliance on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline-derived geometry as required by traditional 3DGS methods. SGPose removes the dependence on CAD models by regressing dense 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model from sparse input and random initialization, while the geometric-consistent depth supervision and online synthetic view warping are key to the success. Experiments on typical benchmarks, especially on the Occlusion LM-O dataset, demonstrate that SGPose outperforms existing methods even under sparse view constraints, under-scoring its potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

GS-Pose begins with a set of posed RGB images of a previously unseen object and builds three distinct representations stored in a database. At inference, GS-Pose operates sequentially by locating the object in the input image, estimating its initial 6D pose using a retrieval approach, and refining the pose with a render-and-compare method. The key insight is the application of the appropriate object representation at each stage of the process. In particular, for the refinement step, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique that offers high rendering speed and relatively low optimization time. Off-the-shelf toolchains and commodity hardware, such as mobile phones, can be used to capture new objects to be added to the database.

We initially detect instance-wise keypoints with a YOLOv8s model to compute 6D pose estimates of known objects by solving PnP. We use a ray tracing approach to track a geometric scene graph consisting of mesh models of object instances. In contrast to classical point-to-point matching, this leads to more robust results, especially under occlusions between objects instances. We show that using this hybrid strategy leads to robust self-localization, pre-segmentation of the range sensor data and accurate pose tracking of objects using the same environmental representation. All detected objects are integrated into a semantic scene graph. This scene graph then serves as a front end to a semantic mapping framework to allow spatial reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certifying Robustness of Learning-Based Keypoint Detection and Pose Estimation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00117v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the certification of the local robustness of vision-based two-stage 6D object pose estimation. The two-stage method for object pose estimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural network-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods' robustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on their local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust estimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform the certification of local robustness into neural network verification for classification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output specifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate verification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear operations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of injecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull representation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict semantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we propagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then formulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the setting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each pixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear, classification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both sound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on realistic perturbations.

Unlike most existing real-world object-centric datasets which only come with RGB capturing, the direct capture of the depth channel allows better 3D annotations and broader downstream applications. WildRGB-D comprises large-scale category-level RGB-D object videos, which are taken using an iPhone to go around the objects in 360 degrees. It contains around 8500 recorded objects and nearly 20000 RGB-D videos across 46 common object categories. These videos are taken with diverse cluttered backgrounds with three setups to cover as many real-world scenarios as possible: (i) a single object in one video; (ii) multiple objects in one video; and (iii) an object with a static hand in one video. The dataset is annotated with object masks, real-world scale camera poses, and reconstructed aggregated point clouds from RGBD videos. We benchmark four tasks with WildRGB-D including novel view synthesis, camera pose estimation, object 6d pose estimation, and object surface reconstruction. Our experiments show that the large-scale capture of RGB-D objects provides a large potential to advance 3D object learning.

The widely available, inexpensive and high-resolution RGB sensors and CNNs that allow for fast inference based on this modality make monocular approaches especially well suited for robotics applications. We observe that previous surveys on object pose estimation establish the state of the art for varying modalities, single- and multi-view settings, and datasets and metrics that consider a multitude of applications. We argue, however, that those works' broad scope hinders the identification of open challenges that are specific to monocular approaches and the derivation of promising future challenges for their application in robotics. By providing a unified view on recent publications from both robotics and computer vision, we find that occlusion handling, novel pose representations, and formalizing and improving category-level pose estimation are still fundamental challenges that are highly relevant for robotics. Moreover, to further improve robotic performance, large object sets, novel objects, refractive materials, and uncertainty estimates are central, largely unsolved open challenges. In order to address them, ontological reasoning, deformability handling, scene-level reasoning, realistic datasets, and the ecological footprint of algorithms need to be improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Transactions on Robotics: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609560 arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.11827</p></details> |
| **[Shape-biased Texture Agnostic Representations for Improved Textureless and Metallic Object Detection and 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04878v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in machine learning have greatly benefited object detection and 6D pose estimation. However, textureless and metallic objects still pose a significant challenge due to few visual cues and the texture bias of CNNs. To address his issue, we propose a strategy for inducing a shape bias to CNN training. In particular, by randomizing textures applied to object surfaces during data rendering, we create training data without consistent textural cues. This methodology allows for seamless integration into existing data rendering engines, and results in negligible computational overhead for data rendering and network training. Our findings demonstrate that the shape bias we induce via randomized texturing, improves over existing approaches using style transfer. We evaluate with three detectors and two pose estimators. For the most recent object detector and for pose estimation in general, estimation accuracy improves for textureless and metallic objects. Additionally we show that our approach increases the pose estimation accuracy in the presence of image noise and strong illumination changes. Code and datasets are publicly available at github.com/hoenigpeter/randomized_texturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[FoundPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with Foundation Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18809v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FoundPose, a model-based method for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single RGB image. The method can quickly onboard new objects using their 3D models without requiring any object- or task-specific training. In contrast, existing methods typically pre-train on large-scale, task-specific datasets in order to generalize to new objects and to bridge the image-to-model domain gap. We demonstrate that such generalization capabilities can be observed in a recent vision foundation model trained in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, our method estimates the object pose from image-to-model 2D-3D correspondences, which are established by matching patch descriptors from the recent DINOv2 model between the image and pre-rendered object templates. We find that reliable correspondences can be established by kNN matching of patch descriptors from an intermediate DINOv2 layer. Such descriptors carry stronger positional information than descriptors from the last layer, and we show their importance when semantic information is ambiguous due to object symmetries or a lack of texture. To avoid establishing correspondences against all object templates, we develop an efficient template retrieval approach that integrates the patch descriptors into the bag-of-words representation and can promptly propose a handful of similarly looking templates. Additionally, we apply featuremetric alignment to compensate for discrepancies in the 2D-3D correspondences caused by coarse patch sampling. The resulting method noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for refinement-free pose estimation on the standard BOP benchmark with seven diverse datasets and can be seamlessly combined with an existing render-and-compare refinement method to achieve RGB-only state-of-the-art results.

Both factors limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a pipeline that does not require CAD models and allows training a state-of-the-art pose estimator requiring only a small set of real images as input. Our method is based on a NeuS2 object representation, that we learn through a semi-automated procedure based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and object-agnostic segmentation. We exploit the novel-view synthesis ability of NeuS2 and simple cut-and-paste augmentation to automatically generate photorealistic object renderings, which we use to train the correspondence-based SurfEmb pose estimator. We evaluate our method on the LINEMOD-Occlusion dataset, extensively studying the impact of its individual components and showing competitive performance with respect to approaches based on CAD models and PBR data. We additionally demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of our pipeline on self-collected real-world objects, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art CAD-model-free approaches, with better accuracy and robustness to mild occlusions. To allow the robotics community to benefit from this system, we will publicly release it at https://www.github.com/ethz-asl/neusurfemb.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2024. 8 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Our approach combines keypoint-based method with learnable pose regression through `keypoint-graph', which is a graph representation of the keypoints. KGpose first estimates 3D keypoints for each object using an attentional multi-modal feature fusion of RGB and point cloud features. These keypoints are estimated from each point of point cloud and converted into a graph representation. The network directly regresses 6D pose parameters for each point through a sequence of keypoint-graph embedding and local graph embedding which are designed with graph convolutions, followed by rotation and translation heads. The final pose for each object is selected from the candidates of point-wise predictions. The method achieves competitive results on the benchmark dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. KGpose enables multi-object pose estimation without requiring an extra localization step, offering a unified and efficient solution for understanding geometric contexts in complex scenes for robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable using natural language descriptions to support 6D pose estimation of unseen objects, these solutions underperform compared to model-based methods. In this work we present Horyon, an open-vocabulary VLM-based architecture that addresses relative pose estimation between two scenes of an unseen object, described by a textual prompt only. We use the textual prompt to identify the unseen object in the scenes and then obtain high-resolution multi-scale features. These features are used to extract cross-scene matches for registration. We evaluate our model on a benchmark with a large variety of unseen objects across four datasets, namely REAL275, Toyota-Light, Linemod, and YCB-Video. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, outperforming by 12.6 in Average Recall the previous best-performing approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

In contrast to existing approaches, in our setting (i) the object of interest is specified solely through the textual prompt, (ii) no object model (e.g., CAD or video sequence) is required at inference, and (iii) the object is imaged from two RGBD viewpoints of different scenes. To operate in this setting, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model to segment the object of interest from the scenes and to estimate its relative 6D pose. The key of our approach is a carefully devised strategy to fuse object-level information provided by the prompt with local image features, resulting in a feature space that can generalize to novel concepts. We validate our approach on a new benchmark based on two popular datasets, REAL275 and Toyota-Light, which collectively encompass 34 object instances appearing in four thousand image pairs. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both a well-established hand-crafted method and a recent deep learning-based baseline in estimating the relative 6D pose of objects in different scenes.

We train a Diffusion Model to bridge this gap using a relatively small dataset of real-world images randomly collected from unlabeled everyday objects via the DIGIT sensor. Subsequently, we employ a simulator to generate images by uniformly sampling the surface of objects from the YCB Model Set. These simulated images are then translated into the real domain using the Diffusion Model and automatically labeled to train a classifier. During this training, we further align features of the two domains using an adversarial procedure. Our evaluation is conducted on a dataset of tactile images obtained from a set of ten 3D printed YCB objects. The results reveal a total accuracy of 81.9%, a significant improvement compared to the 34.7% achieved by the classifier trained solely on simulated images. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. We further validate our approach using the classifier on a 6D object pose estimation task from tactile data.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, accepted to ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Learning based approaches typically require training data from a highly accurate CAD model or labeled training data acquired using a complex setup. We address this by learning to estimate pose from weakly labeled data without a known CAD model. We propose to use a NeRF to learn object shape implicitly which is later used to learn view-invariant features in conjunction with CNN using a contrastive loss. While NeRF helps in learning features that are view-consistent, CNN ensures that the learned features respect symmetry. During inference, CNN is used to predict view-invariant features which can be used to establish correspondences with the implicit 3d model in NeRF. The correspondences are then used to estimate the pose in the reference frame of NeRF. Our approach can also handle symmetric objects unlike other approaches using a similar training setup. Specifically, we learn viewpoint invariant, discriminative features using NeRF which are later used for pose estimation. We evaluated our approach on LM, LM-Occlusion, and T-Less dataset and achieved benchmark accuracy despite using weakly labeled data.</p></details> | 3DV 2024 |

This scarcity impedes comprehensive evaluation of model performance, limiting research advancements. Furthermore, the restricted number of available instances or categories curtails its applications. To address these issues, this paper introduces Omni6DPose, a substantial dataset characterized by its diversity in object categories, large scale, and variety in object materials. Omni6DPose is divided into three main components: ROPE (Real 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), which includes 332K images annotated with over 1.5M annotations across 581 instances in 149 categories; SOPE(Simulated 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), consisting of 475K images created in a mixed reality setting with depth simulation, annotated with over 5M annotations across 4162 instances in the same 149 categories; and the manually aligned real scanned objects used in both ROPE and SOPE. Omni6DPose is inherently challenging due to the substantial variations and ambiguities. To address this challenge, we introduce GenPose++, an enhanced version of the SOTA category-level pose estimation framework, incorporating two pivotal improvements: Semantic-aware feature extraction and Clustering-based aggregation. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive benchmarking analysis to evaluate the performance of previous methods on this large-scale dataset in the realms of 6D object pose estimation and pose tracking.</p></details> |  |

Given challenges like rust, high reflectivity, and absent textures, this paper introduces a point cloud based pose estimation framework (PS6D). PS6D centers on slender and multi-symmetric objects. It extracts multi-scale features through an attention-guided feature extraction module, designs a symmetry-aware rotation loss and a center distance sensitive translation loss to regress the pose of each point to the centroid of the instance, and then uses a two-stage clustering method to complete instance segmentation and pose estimation. Objects from the Sil\'eane and IPA datasets and typical workpieces from industrial practice are used to generate data and evaluate the algorithm. In comparison to the state-of-the-art approach, PS6D demonstrates an 11.5\% improvement in F$_{1_{inst}}$ and a 14.8\% improvement in Recall. The main part of PS6D has been deployed to the software of Mech-Mind, and achieves a 91.7\% success rate in bin-picking experiments, marking its application in industrial pose estimation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Domain randomization hereby plays an important role in reducing the simulation to reality gap. However, this generalization might not be effective in specialized domains like a production environment involving complex assemblies. Either the individual parts, trained with synthetic images, are integrated in much larger assemblies making them indistinguishable from their counterparts and result in false positives or are partially occluded just enough to give rise to false negatives. Domain knowledge is vital in these cases and if conceived effectively while generating synthetic data, can show a considerable improvement in bridging the simulation to reality gap. This paper focuses on synthetic data generation procedures for parts and assemblies used in a production environment. The basic procedures for synthetic data generation and their various combinations are evaluated and compared on images captured in a production environment, where results show up to 15% improvement using combinations of basic procedures. Reducing the simulation to reality gap in this way can aid to utilize the true potential of robot assisted production using artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, LaTeX; typos corrected; has not been presented in any conference or published in journal</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose MatchU, a Fuse-Describe-Match strategy for 6D pose estimation from RGB-D images. MatchU is a generic approach that fuses 2D texture and 3D geometric cues for 6D pose prediction of unseen objects. We rely on learning geometric 3D descriptors that are rotation-invariant by design. By encoding pose-agnostic geometry, the learned descriptors naturally generalize to unseen objects and capture symmetries. To tackle ambiguous associations using 3D geometry only, we fuse additional RGB information into our descriptor. This is achieved through a novel attention-based mechanism that fuses cross-modal information, together with a matching loss that leverages the latent space learned from RGB data to guide the descriptor learning process. Extensive experiments reveal the generalizability of both the RGB-D fusion strategy as well as the descriptor efficacy. Benefiting from the novel designs, MatchU surpasses all existing methods by a significant margin in terms of both accuracy and speed, even without the requirement of expensive re-training or rendering.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, in high risk scenarios such as human-robot interaction, industrial inspection, and automation, reliable pose estimates are crucial. In the last years, increasingly accurate and robust deep-learning-based approaches for 6D object pose estimation have been proposed. Many top-performing methods are not end-to-end trainable but consist of multiple stages. In the context of deep uncertainty quantification, deep ensembles are considered as state of the art since they have been proven to produce well-calibrated and robust uncertainty estimates. However, deep ensembles can only be applied to methods that can be trained end-to-end. In this work, we propose a method to quantify the uncertainty of multi-stage 6D object pose estimation approaches with deep ensembles. For the implementation, we choose SurfEmb as representative, since it is one of the top-performing 6D object pose estimation approaches in the BOP Challenge 2022. We apply established metrics and concepts for deep uncertainty quantification to evaluate the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel uncertainty calibration score for regression tasks to quantify the quality of the estimated uncertainty.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In this area, dense correspondence-based methods have achieved leading performance. However, they do not explicitly consider the local and global geometric information of different instances, resulting in poor generalization ability to unseen instances with significant shape variations. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel Instance-Adaptive and Geometric-Aware Keypoint Learning method for category-level 6D object pose estimation (AG-Pose), which includes two key designs: (1) The first design is an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Detection module, which can adaptively detect a set of sparse keypoints for various instances to represent their geometric structures. (2) The second design is a Geometric-Aware Feature Aggregation module, which can efficiently integrate the local and global geometric information into keypoint features. These two modules can work together to establish robust keypoint-level correspondences for unseen instances, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the model.Experimental results on CAMERA25 and REAL275 datasets show that the proposed AG-Pose outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin without category-specific shape priors.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

We bridge the gap between these two setups with a neural implicit representation that allows for effective novel view synthesis, keeping the downstream pose estimation modules invariant under the same unified framework. Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation. Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin.

Specifically, previous methods for novel objects do not make good use of the target object's 3D shape information since they focus on generalization by processing the shape indirectly, making them less effective. We present GenFlow, an approach that enables both accuracy and generalization to novel objects with the guidance of the target object's shape. Our method predicts optical flow between the rendered image and the observed image and refines the 6D pose iteratively. It boosts the performance by a constraint of the 3D shape and the generalizable geometric knowledge learned from an end-to-end differentiable system. We further improve our model by designing a cascade network architecture to exploit the multi-scale correlations and coarse-to-fine refinement. GenFlow ranked first on the unseen object pose estimation benchmarks in both the RGB and RGB-D cases. It also achieves performance competitive with existing state-of-the-art methods for the seen object pose estimation without any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic Task Success Evaluation Under Multi-modal Non-Parametric Object Pose Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10874v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D object pose estimation is essential for various robotic tasks. Uncertain pose estimates can lead to task failures; however, a certain degree of error in the pose estimates is often acceptable. Hence, by quantifying errors in the object pose estimate and acceptable errors for task success, robots can make informed decisions. This is a challenging problem as both the object pose uncertainty and acceptable error for the robotic task are often multi-modal and cannot be parameterized with commonly used uni-modal distributions. In this paper, we introduce a framework for evaluating robotic task success under object pose uncertainty, representing both the estimated error space of the object pose and the acceptable error space for task success using multi-modal non-parametric probability distributions. The proposed framework pre-computes the acceptable error space for task success using dynamic simulations and subsequently integrates the pre-computed acceptable error space over the estimated error space of the object pose to predict the likelihood of the task success. We evaluated the proposed framework on two mobile manipulation tasks. Our results show that by representing the estimated and the acceptable error space using multi-modal non-parametric distributions, we achieve higher task success rates and fewer failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |
| **[GigaPose: Fast and Robust Novel Object Pose Estimation via One Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14155v2)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GigaPose, a fast, robust, and accurate method for CAD-based novel object pose estimation in RGB images. GigaPose first leverages discriminative "templates", rendered images of the CAD models, to recover the out-of-plane rotation and then uses patch correspondences to estimate the four remaining parameters. Our approach samples templates in only a two-degrees-of-freedom space instead of the usual three and matches the input image to the templates using fast nearest-neighbor search in feature space, results in a speedup factor of 35x compared to the state of the art. Moreover, GigaPose is significantly more robust to segmentation errors. Our extensive evaluation on the seven core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated with existing refinement methods. Additionally, we show the potential of GigaPose with 3D models predicted by recent work on 3D reconstruction from a single image, relaxing the need for CAD models and making 6D pose object estimation much more convenient.

Despite the impressive progress enabled by deep learning, single-view RGB pose estimation models perform poorly in cluttered dynamic environments. Imbuing the rich temporal information contained in the video of scenes has the potential to enhance models ability to deal with the adverse effects of occlusion and the dynamic nature of the environments. Moreover, joint object detection and pose estimation models are better suited to leverage the co-dependent nature of the tasks for improving the accuracy of both tasks. To this end, we propose attention-based temporal fusion for multi-object 6D pose estimation that accumulates information across multiple frames of a video sequence. Our MOTPose method takes a sequence of images as input and performs joint object detection and pose estimation for all objects in one forward pass. It learns to aggregate both object embeddings and object parameters over multiple time steps using cross-attention-based fusion modules. We evaluate our method on the physically-realistic cluttered bin-picking dataset SynPick and the YCB-Video dataset and demonstrate improved pose estimation accuracy as well as better object detection accuracy</p></details> |  |

Fortunately, the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has showcased remarkable zero-shot transfer performance, which provides a promising solution to tackle this task. Motivated by this, we introduce SAM-6D, a novel framework designed to realize the task through two steps, including instance segmentation and pose estimation. Given the target objects, SAM-6D employs two dedicated sub-networks, namely Instance Segmentation Model (ISM) and Pose Estimation Model (PEM), to perform these steps on cluttered RGB-D images. ISM takes SAM as an advanced starting point to generate all possible object proposals and selectively preserves valid ones through meticulously crafted object matching scores in terms of semantics, appearance and geometry. By treating pose estimation as a partial-to-partial point matching problem, PEM performs a two-stage point matching process featuring a novel design of background tokens to construct dense 3D-3D correspondence, ultimately yielding the pose estimates. Without bells and whistles, SAM-6D outperforms the existing methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark for both instance segmentation and pose estimation of novel objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2024.

Current methods for scene understanding typically rely on a combination of trained models paired with either an explicit or learnt volumetric representation, all of which have their own drawbacks and limitations. We introduce DreamUp3D, a novel Object-Centric Generative Model (OCGM) designed explicitly to perform inference on a 3D scene informed only by a single RGB-D image. DreamUp3D is a self-supervised model, trained end-to-end, and is capable of segmenting objects, providing 3D object reconstructions, generating object-centric latent representations and accurate per-object 6D pose estimates. We compare DreamUp3D to baselines including NeRFs, pre-trained CLIP-features, ObSurf, and ObPose, in a range of tasks including 3D scene reconstruction, object matching and object pose estimation. Our experiments show that our model outperforms all baselines by a significant margin in real-world scenarios displaying its applicability for 3D scene understanding tasks while meeting the strict demands exhibited in robotics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving 2D-3D Dense Correspondences with Diffusion Models for 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06436v1)** | 2024-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating 2D-3D correspondences between RGB images and 3D space is a fundamental problem in 6D object pose estimation. Recent pose estimators use dense correspondence maps and Point-to-Point algorithms to estimate object poses. The accuracy of pose estimation depends heavily on the quality of the dense correspondence maps and their ability to withstand occlusion, clutter, and challenging material properties. Currently, dense correspondence maps are estimated using image-to-image translation models based on GANs, Autoencoders, or direct regression models. However, recent advancements in image-to-image translation have led to diffusion models being the superior choice when evaluated on benchmarking datasets. In this study, we compare image-to-image translation networks based on GANs and diffusion models for the downstream task of 6D object pose estimation. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion-based image-to-image translation model outperforms the GAN, revealing potential for further improvements in 6D object pose estimation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the First Austrian Symposium on AI, Robotics, and Vision 2024</p></details> |

The prior can be used to initialize the 3D object translation and facilitate 3D object rotation estimation. Unfortunately, the object detectors that are used for this purpose do not generalize to unseen objects. Therefore, existing 6D pose estimation methods for unseen objects either assume the ground-truth object location to be known or yield inaccurate results when it is unavailable. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a method, LocPoseNet, able to robustly learn location prior for unseen objects. Our method builds upon a template matching strategy, where we propose to distribute the reference kernels and convolve them with a query to efficiently compute multi-scale correlations. We then introduce a novel translation estimator, which decouples scale-aware and scale-robust features to predict different object location parameters. Our method outperforms existing works by a large margin on LINEMOD and GenMOP. We further construct a challenging synthetic dataset, which allows us to highlight the better robustness of our method to various noise sources.

| **[Leveraging Positional Encoding for Robust Multi-Reference-Based Object 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16284v1)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating the pose of an object is a crucial task in computer vision and robotics. There are two main deep learning approaches for this: geometric representation regression and iterative refinement. However, these methods have some limitations that reduce their effectiveness. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and propose new strategies to overcome them. To tackle the issue of blurry geometric representation, we use positional encoding with high-frequency components for the object's 3D coordinates. To address the local minimum problem in refinement methods, we introduce a normalized image plane-based multi-reference refinement strategy that's independent of intrinsic matrix constraints. Lastly, we utilize adaptive instance normalization and a simple occlusion augmentation method to help our model concentrate on the target object. Our experiments on Linemod, Linemod-Occlusion, and YCB-Video datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods. We will soon release the code.</p></details> |  |

To evaluate the robustness of SNEs on noisy data, we create a large-scale synthetic surface normal (SSN) dataset containing 20 scenarios (ten indoor scenarios and ten outdoor scenarios with and without random Gaussian noise added to depth images). Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3F2N+ achieves greater performance than all other geometry-based surface normal estimators, with average angular errors of 7.85$^\circ$, 8.95$^\circ$, 9.25$^\circ$, and 11.98$^\circ$ on the clean-indoor, clean-outdoor, noisy-indoor, and noisy-outdoor datasets, respectively. We conduct three additional experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating our proposed 3F2N+ into downstream robot perception tasks, including freespace detection, 6D object pose estimation, and point cloud completion.

Building on successful instance-level approaches, research is shifting towards category-level pose estimation for practical applications. Current category-level datasets, however, fall short in annotation quality and pose variety. Addressing this, we introduce HouseCat6D, a new category-level 6D pose dataset. It features 1) multi-modality with Polarimetric RGB and Depth (RGBD+P), 2) encompasses 194 diverse objects across 10 household categories, including two photometrically challenging ones, and 3) provides high-quality pose annotations with an error range of only 1.35 mm to 1.74 mm. The dataset also includes 4) 41 large-scale scenes with comprehensive viewpoint and occlusion coverage, 5) a checkerboard-free environment, and 6) dense 6D parallel-jaw robotic grasp annotations.

| **[Visually Guided Model Predictive Robot Control via 6D Object Pose Localization and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05344v1)** | 2023-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of this work is to enable manipulation tasks with respect to the 6D pose of a dynamically moving object using a camera mounted on a robot. Examples include maintaining a constant relative 6D pose of the robot arm with respect to the object, grasping the dynamically moving object, or co-manipulating the object together with a human. Fast and accurate 6D pose estimation is crucial to achieve smooth and stable robot control in such situations. The contributions of this work are three fold. First, we propose a new visual perception module that asynchronously combines accurate learning-based 6D object pose localizer and a high-rate model-based 6D pose tracker. The outcome is a low-latency accurate and temporally consistent 6D object pose estimation from the input video stream at up to 120 Hz. Second, we develop a visually guided robot arm controller that combines the new visual perception module with a torque-based model predictive control algorithm. Asynchronous combination of the visual and robot proprioception signals at their corresponding frequencies results in stable and robust 6D object pose guided robot arm control. Third, we experimentally validate the proposed approach on a challenging 6D pose estimation benchmark and demonstrate 6D object pose-guided control with dynamically moving objects on a real 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE(3) Diffusion Model-based Point Cloud Registration for Robust 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17359v1)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce an SE(3) diffusion model-based point cloud registration framework for 6D object pose estimation in real-world scenarios. Our approach formulates the 3D registration task as a denoising diffusion process, which progressively refines the pose of the source point cloud to obtain a precise alignment with the model point cloud. Training our framework involves two operations: An SE(3) diffusion process and an SE(3) reverse process. The SE(3) diffusion process gradually perturbs the optimal rigid transformation of a pair of point clouds by continuously injecting noise (perturbation transformation). By contrast, the SE(3) reverse process focuses on learning a denoising network that refines the noisy transformation step-by-step, bringing it closer to the optimal transformation for accurate pose estimation. Unlike standard diffusion models used in linear Euclidean spaces, our diffusion model operates on the SE(3) manifold. This requires exploiting the linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{se}(3)$ associated with SE(3) to constrain the transformation transitions during the diffusion and reverse processes. Additionally, to effectively train our denoising network, we derive a registration-specific variational lower bound as the optimization objective for model learning. Furthermore, we show that our denoising network can be constructed with a surrogate registration model, making our approach applicable to different deep registration networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our diffusion registration framework presents outstanding pose estimation performance on the real-world TUD-L, LINEMOD, and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS-2023</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Based Object 6D-Pose Estimation during Non-Prehensile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13572v3)** | 2023-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method to track the 6D pose of an object over time, while the object is under non-prehensile manipulation by a robot. At any given time during the manipulation of the object, we assume access to the robot joint controls and an image from a camera. We use the robot joint controls to perform a physics-based prediction of how the object might be moving. We then combine this prediction with the observation coming from the camera, to estimate the object pose as accurately as possible. We use a particle filtering approach to combine the control information with the visual information. We compare the proposed method with two baselines: (i) using only an image-based pose estimation system at each time-step, and (ii) a particle filter which does not perform the computationally expensive physics predictions, but assumes the object moves with constant velocity. Our results show that making physics-based predictions is worth the computational cost, resulting in more accurate tracking, and estimating object pose even when the object is not clearly visible to the camera.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to learn 6D poses for roboticassembly by natural language instructions. For this purpose, Language-Instructed 6D Pose Regression Network (LanPose) is proposed to jointly predict the 6D poses of the observed object and the corresponding assembly position. Our proposed approach is based on the fusion of geometric and linguistic features, which allows us to finely integrate multi-modality input and map it to the 6D pose in SE(3) space by the cross-attention mechanism and the language-integrated 6D pose mapping module, respectively. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, an integrated robotic system is established to precisely and robustly perceive, grasp, manipulate and assemble blocks by language commands. 98.09 and 93.55 in ADD(-S)-0.1d are derived for the prediction of 6D object pose and 6D assembly pose, respectively. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed language-instructed 6D pose estimation methodology and its potential to enable robots to better understand and execute natural language instructions.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In contrast to ``instance-level" and ``category-level" pose estimation methods, our algorithm learns object representation in a category-agnostic way, which endows it with strong generalization capabilities across object categories. Specifically, we employ a neural process-based meta-learning approach to train an encoder to capture texture and geometry of an object in a latent representation, based on very few RGB-D images and ground-truth keypoints. The latent representation is then used by a simultaneously meta-trained decoder to predict the 6D pose of the object in new images. Furthermore, we propose a novel geometry-aware decoder for the keypoint prediction using a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which explicitly takes geometric constraints specific to each object into consideration. To evaluate our algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on the \linemod dataset, and on our new fully-annotated synthetic datasets generated from Multiple Categories in Multiple Scenes (MCMS). Experimental results demonstrate that our model performs well on unseen objects with very different shapes and appearances. Remarkably, our model also shows robust performance on occluded scenes although trained fully on data without occlusion.

| **[Linear-Covariance Loss for End-to-End Learning of 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11516v2)** | 2023-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most modern image-based 6D object pose estimation methods learn to predict 2D-3D correspondences, from which the pose can be obtained using a PnP solver. Because of the non-differentiable nature of common PnP solvers, these methods are supervised via the individual correspondences. To address this, several methods have designed differentiable PnP strategies, thus imposing supervision on the pose obtained after the PnP step. Here, we argue that this conflicts with the averaging nature of the PnP problem, leading to gradients that may encourage the network to degrade the accuracy of individual correspondences. To address this, we derive a loss function that exploits the ground truth pose before solving the PnP problem. Specifically, we linearize the PnP solver around the ground-truth pose and compute the covariance of the resulting pose distribution. We then define our loss based on the diagonal covariance elements, which entails considering the final pose estimate yet not suffering from the PnP averaging issue. Our experiments show that our loss consistently improves the pose estimation accuracy for both dense and sparse correspondence based methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on both Linemod-Occluded and YCB-Video.</p></details> |  |

We argue that learning point-level discriminative features is overlooked in the literature. To this end, we revisit Fully Convolutional Geometric Features (FCGF) and tailor it for object 6D pose estimation to achieve state-of-the-art performance. FCGF employs sparse convolutions and learns point-level features using a fully-convolutional network by optimising a hardest contrastive loss. We can outperform recent competitors on popular benchmarks by adopting key modifications to the loss and to the input data representations, by carefully tuning the training strategies, and by employing data augmentations suitable for the underlying problem. We carry out a thorough ablation to study the contribution of each modification.

The state-of-the-art 6D object pose estimation methods rely on object-specific training and therefore do not generalize to unseen objects. Recent novel object pose estimation methods are solving this issue using task-specific fine-tuned CNNs for deep template matching. This adaptation for pose estimation still requires expensive data rendering and training procedures. MegaPose for example is trained on a dataset consisting of two million images showing 20,000 different objects to reach such generalization capabilities. To overcome this shortcoming we introduce ZS6D, for zero-shot novel object 6D pose estimation. Visual descriptors, extracted using pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT), are used for matching rendered templates against query images of objects and for establishing local correspondences. These local correspondences enable deriving geometric correspondences and are used for estimating the object's 6D pose with RANSAC-based PnP. This approach showcases that the image descriptors extracted by pre-trained ViTs are well-suited to achieve a notable improvement over two state-of-the-art novel object 6D pose estimation methods, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments are performed on LMO, YCBV, and TLESS. In comparison to one of the two methods we improve the Average Recall on all three datasets and compared to the second method we improve on two datasets.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, underwater target pose estimation is remarkably challenging due to, among many factors, limited visibility, light scattering, cluttered environments, and constantly varying water conditions. An approach is to employ sonar or laser sensing to acquire 3D data, however, the data is not clear and the sensors expensive. For this reason, the community has focused on extracting pose estimates from RGB input. In this work, we propose an approach that leverages 2D object detection to reliably compute 6D pose estimates in different underwater scenarios. We test our proposal with 4 objects with symmetrical shapes and poor texture spanning across 33,920 synthetic and 10 real scenes. All objects and scenes are made available in an open-source dataset that includes annotations for object detection and pose estimation. When benchmarking against similar end-to-end methodologies for 6D object pose estimation, our pipeline provides estimates that are 8% more accurate. We also demonstrate the real world usability of our pose estimation pipeline on an underwater robotic manipulator in a reaching task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under RA-L Submission</p></details> |
| **[Exploiting Point-Wise Attention in 6D Object Pose Estimation Based on Bidirectional Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08518v3)** | 2023-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional geometric registration based estimation methods only exploit the CAD model implicitly, which leads to their dependence on observation quality and deficiency to occlusion. To address the problem,the paper proposes a bidirectional correspondence prediction network with a point-wise attention-aware mechanism. This network not only requires the model points to predict the correspondence but also explicitly models the geometric similarities between observations and the model prior. Our key insight is that the correlations between each model point and scene point provide essential information for learning point-pair matches. To further tackle the correlation noises brought by feature distribution divergence, we design a simple but effective pseudo-siamese network to improve feature homogeneity. Experimental results on the public datasets of LineMOD, YCB-Video, and Occ-LineMOD show that the proposed method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art methods under the same evaluation criteria. Its robustness in estimating poses is greatly improved, especially in an environment with severe occlusions.</p></details> |  |

Our key insight is that the accuracy of the 6D object pose estimate can be improved by explicitly completing the shape of the object. To this end, we introduce a novel visuotactile shape completion module that uses a conditional Generative Adversarial Network to complete the shape of an in-hand object based on volumetric representation. This approach improves over prior works that directly regress visuotactile observations to a 6D pose. By explicitly completing the shape of the in-hand object and jointly optimizing the shape completion and pose estimation tasks, we improve the accuracy of the 6D object pose estimate. We train and test our model on a synthetic dataset and compare it with the state-of-the-art. In the visuotactile shape completion task, we outperform the state-of-the-art by 265% using the Intersection of Union metric and achieve 88% lower Chamfer Distance. In the visuotactile pose estimation task, we present results that suggest our framework reduces position and angular errors by 35% and 64%, respectively. Furthermore, we ablate our framework to confirm the gain on the 6D object pose estimate from explicitly completing the shape. Ultimately, we show that our framework produces models that are robust to sim-to-real transfer on a real-world robot platform.</p></details> | Accepted by RA-L |

Existing deep learning approaches for 6D pose estimation typically rely on the assumption of availability of 3D object models and 6D pose annotations. However, precise annotation of 6D poses in real data is intricate, time-consuming and not scalable, while synthetic data scales well but lacks realism. To avoid these problems, we present a weakly-supervised reconstruction-based pipeline, named NeRF-Pose, which needs only 2D object segmentation and known relative camera poses during training. Following the first-reconstruct-then-regress idea, we first reconstruct the objects from multiple views in the form of an implicit neural representation. Then, we train a pose regression network to predict pixel-wise 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model. At inference, the approach only needs a single image as input. A NeRF-enabled PnP+RANSAC algorithm is used to estimate stable and accurate pose from the predicted correspondences. Experiments on LineMod and LineMod-Occlusion show that the proposed method has state-of-the-art accuracy in comparison to the best 6D pose estimation methods in spite of being trained only with weak labels. Besides, we extend the Homebrewed DB dataset with more real training images to support the weakly supervised task and achieve compelling results on this dataset. The extended dataset and code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

Inverse graphics is an appealing approach to 3D scene understanding that aims to infer the 3D scene structure from 2D images. In this paper, we introduce probabilistic modeling to the inverse graphics framework to quantify uncertainty and achieve robustness in 6D pose estimation tasks. Specifically, we propose 3D Neural Embedding Likelihood (3DNEL) as a unified probabilistic model over RGB-D images, and develop efficient inference procedures on 3D scene descriptions. 3DNEL effectively combines learned neural embeddings from RGB with depth information to improve robustness in sim-to-real 6D object pose estimation from RGB-D images. Performance on the YCB-Video dataset is on par with state-of-the-art yet is much more robust in challenging regimes. In contrast to discriminative approaches, 3DNEL's probabilistic generative formulation jointly models multiple objects in a scene, quantifies uncertainty in a principled way, and handles object pose tracking under heavy occlusion. Finally, 3DNEL provides a principled framework for incorporating prior knowledge about the scene and objects, which allows natural extension to additional tasks like camera pose tracking from video.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2023 camera ready</p></details> |
| **[DR-Pose: A Two-stage Deformation-and-Registration Pipeline for Category-level 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01925v1)** | 2023-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level object pose estimation involves estimating the 6D pose and the 3D metric size of objects from predetermined categories. While recent approaches take categorical shape prior information as reference to improve pose estimation accuracy, the single-stage network design and training manner lead to sub-optimal performance since there are two distinct tasks in the pipeline. In this paper, the advantage of two-stage pipeline over single-stage design is discussed. To this end, we propose a two-stage deformation-and registration pipeline called DR-Pose, which consists of completion-aided deformation stage and scaled registration stage. The first stage uses a point cloud completion method to generate unseen parts of target object, guiding subsequent deformation on the shape prior. In the second stage, a novel registration network is designed to extract pose-sensitive features and predict the representation of object partial point cloud in canonical space based on the deformation results from the first stage. DR-Pose produces superior results to the state-of-the-art shape prior-based methods on both CAMERA25 and REAL275 benchmarks.

To achieve this, we employ a dense 2D-to-3D correspondence predictor that regresses 3D model coordinates for every pixel. In addition to the 3D coordinates, our model also estimates the pixel-wise coordinate error to discard correspondences that are likely wrong. This allows us to generate multiple 6D pose hypotheses of the object, which we then refine iteratively using a highly efficient region-based approach. We also introduce a novel pixel-wise posterior formulation by which we can estimate the probability for each hypothesis and select the most likely one. As we show in experiments, our approach is capable of dealing with extreme visual conditions including overexposure, high contrast, or low signal-to-noise ratio. This makes it a powerful technique for the particularly challenging task of estimating the pose of tumbling satellites for in-orbit robotic applications. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SPEED+ dataset and has won the SPEC2021 post-mortem competition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a 6D object pose estimation method that can be trained with pure RGB images without any auxiliary information. We first obtain a rough pose initialization from networks trained on synthetic images rendered from the target's 3D mesh. Then, we introduce a refinement strategy leveraging the geometry constraint in synthetic-to-real image pairs from multiple different views. We formulate this geometry constraint as pixel-level flow consistency between the training images with dynamically generated pseudo labels. We evaluate our method on three challenging datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods significantly, with neither 2D annotations nor additional depth images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel rotation estimation network, termed as VI-Net, to make the task easier by decoupling the rotation as the combination of a viewpoint rotation and an in-plane rotation. More specifically, VI-Net bases the feature learning on the sphere with two individual branches for the estimates of two factorized rotations, where a V-Branch is employed to learn the viewpoint rotation via binary classification on the spherical signals, while another I-Branch is used to estimate the in-plane rotation by transforming the signals to view from the zenith direction. To process the spherical signals, a Spherical Feature Pyramid Network is constructed based on a novel design of SPAtial Spherical Convolution (SPA-SConv), which settles the boundary problem of spherical signals via feature padding and realizesviewpoint-equivariant feature extraction by symmetric convolutional operations. We apply the proposed VI-Net to the challenging task of category-level 6D object pose estimation for predicting the poses of unknown objects without available CAD models; experiments on the benchmarking datasets confirm the efficacy of our method, which outperforms the existing ones with a large margin in the regime of high precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV2023.

In this work, we tackle this problem by a novel Deep Fusion Transformer~(DFTr) block that can aggregate cross-modality features for improving pose estimation. Unlike existing fusion methods, the proposed DFTr can better model cross-modality semantic correlation by leveraging their semantic similarity, such that globally enhanced features from different modalities can be better integrated for improved information extraction. Moreover, to further improve robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel weighted vector-wise voting algorithm that employs a non-iterative global optimization strategy for precise 3D keypoint localization while achieving near real-time inference. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and strong generalization capability of our proposed 3D keypoint voting algorithm. Results on four widely used benchmarks also demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2023 |

The state-of-the-art models for pose estimation are convolutional neural network (CNN)-based. Lately, Transformers, an architecture originally proposed for natural language processing, is achieving state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks as well. Equipped with the multi-head self-attention mechanism, Transformers enable simple single-stage end-to-end architectures for learning object detection and 6D object pose estimation jointly. In this work, we propose YOLOPose (short form for You Only Look Once Pose estimation), a Transformer-based multi-object 6D pose estimation method based on keypoint regression and an improved variant of the YOLOPose model. In contrast to the standard heatmaps for predicting keypoints in an image, we directly regress the keypoints. Additionally, we employ a learnable orientation estimation module to predict the orientation from the keypoints. Along with a separate translation estimation module, our model is end-to-end differentiable. Our method is suitable for real-time applications and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We analyze the role of object queries in our architecture and reveal that the object queries specialize in detecting objects in specific image regions. Furthermore, we quantify the accuracy trade-off of using datasets of smaller sizes to train our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Robot...</summary><p>Robotics and Autonomous Systems Journal, Elsevier, to appear 2023. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2205.02536</p></details> |

Monocular object pose estimation gained considerable momentum with the rise of high-performing deep learning-based solutions and is particularly interesting for the community since sensors are inexpensive and inference is fast. Prior works establish the comprehensive state of the art for diverse pose estimation problems. Their broad scopes make it difficult to identify promising future directions. We narrow down the scope to the problem of single-shot monocular 6D object pose estimation, which is commonly used in robotics, and thus are able to identify such trends. By reviewing recent publications in robotics and computer vision, the state of the art is established at the union of both fields. Following that, we identify promising research directions in order to help researchers to formulate relevant research ideas and effectively advance the state of the art. Findings include that methods are sophisticated enough to overcome the domain shift and that occlusion handling is a fundamental challenge. We also highlight problems such as novel object pose estimation and challenging materials handling as central challenges to advance robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version in the making</p></details> |

| **[Optimal-state Dynamics Estimation for Physics-based Human Motion Capture from Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07795v4)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion capture from monocular videos has made significant progress in recent years. However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g. in form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically plausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces and exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current state-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict torques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e. the joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical models, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end, we propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with the kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural Kalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to predict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a physics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to realize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and simulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show that this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps balancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important for not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing physically plausible human poses. The proposed approach excels in the physics-based human pose estimation task and demonstrates the physical plausibility of the predictive dynamics, compared to state of the art.

However, challenges such as pose ambiguity, data drift, and limited adaptability to diverse bodies persist. To address these issues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state estimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six integrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB sensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in resolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with anthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors are affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor data and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF iteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain human motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over state of the art in pose accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

We focus on four-way sleep position classification using data collected from a PSM placed under a mattress in a sleep clinic. Sleep positions can affect sleep quality and the prevalence of sleep disorders, such as apnea. Measurements were performed on patients with suspected sleep disorders referred for assessments at a sleep clinic. Training deep learning models can be challenging in clinical settings due to the need for large amounts of labeled data. To overcome the shortage of labeled training data, we utilize transfer learning to adapt pre-trained deep learning models to accurately estimate sleep positions from a low-resolution PSM dataset collected in a polysomnography sleep lab. Our approach leverages Vision Transformer models pre-trained on ImageNet using masked autoencoding (ViTMAE) and a pre-trained model for human pose estimation (ViTPose). These approaches outperform previous work from PSM-based sleep pose classification using deep learning (TCN) as well as traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) that use engineered features. We evaluate the performance of sleep position classification from 112 nights of patient recordings and validate it on a higher resolution 13-patient dataset. Despite the challenges of differentiating between sleep positions from low-resolution PSM data, our approach shows promise for real-world deployment in clinical settings</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference publication submitted to IEEE I2MTC 2025</p></details> |

Ergonomic assessments can mitigate these risks by identifying workplace adjustments that improve posture and reduce strain. Camera-based systems offer a non-intrusive, cost-effective method for continuous ergonomic tracking, but they also raise significant privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a privacy-aware ergonomic assessment framework utilizing machine learning techniques. Our approach employs adversarial training to develop a lightweight neural network that obfuscates video data, preserving only the essential information needed for human pose estimation. This obfuscation ensures compatibility with standard pose estimation algorithms, maintaining high accuracy while protecting privacy. The obfuscated video data is transmitted to a central server, where state-of-the-art keypoint detection algorithms extract body landmarks. Using multi-view integration, 3D keypoints are reconstructed and evaluated with the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) method. Our system provides a secure, effective solution for ergonomic monitoring in industrial environments, addressing both privacy and workplace safety concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 35th CIRP Design conference</p></details> |

| **[Progressive Inertial Poser: Progressive Real-Time Kinematic Chain Estimation for 3D Full-Body Pose from Three IMU Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05336v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The motion capture system that supports full-body virtual representation is of key significance for virtual reality. Compared to vision-based systems, full-body pose estimation from sparse tracking signals is not limited by environmental conditions or recording range. However, previous works either face the challenge of wearing additional sensors on the pelvis and lower-body or rely on external visual sensors to obtain global positions of key joints. To improve the practicality of the technology for virtual reality applications, we estimate full-body poses using only inertial data obtained from three Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors worn on the head and wrists, thereby reducing the complexity of the hardware system. In this work, we propose a method called Progressive Inertial Poser (ProgIP) for human pose estimation, which combines neural network estimation with a human dynamics model, considers the hierarchical structure of the kinematic chain, and employs a multi-stage progressive network estimation with increased depth to reconstruct full-body motion in real time. The encoder combines Transformer Encoder and bidirectional LSTM (TE-biLSTM) to flexibly capture the temporal dependencies of the inertial sequence, while the decoder based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) transforms high-dimensional features and accurately projects them onto Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model parameters. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on multiple public datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the same inputs, and is comparable to recent works using six IMU sensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Views Are Better than One: Monocular 3D Pose Estimation with Multiview Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12421v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deducing a 3D human pose from a single 2D image is inherently challenging because multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D representation. 3D data can resolve this pose ambiguity, but it is expensive to record and requires an intricate setup that is often restricted to controlled lab environments. We propose a method that improves the performance of deep learning-based monocular 3D human pose estimation models by using multiview data only during training, but not during inference. We introduce a novel loss function, consistency loss, which operates on two synchronized views. This approach is simpler than previous models that require 3D ground truth or intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. Our consistency loss penalizes differences in two pose sequences after rigid alignment. We also demonstrate that our consistency loss substantially improves performance for fine-tuning without requiring 3D data. Furthermore, we show that using our consistency loss can yield state-of-the-art performance when training models from scratch in a semi-supervised manner. Our findings provide a simple way to capture new data, e.g in a new domain. This data can be added using off-the-shelf cameras with no calibration requirements. We make all our code and data publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Global Motion Estimation in Sparse IMU-based Motion Capture with Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05010v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By learning human motion priors, motion capture can be achieved by 6 inertial measurement units (IMUs) in recent years with the development of deep learning techniques, even though the sensor inputs are sparse and noisy. However, human global motions are still challenging to be reconstructed by IMUs. This paper aims to solve this problem by involving physics. It proposes a physical optimization scheme based on multiple contacts to enable physically plausible translation estimation in the full 3D space where the z-directional motion is usually challenging for previous works. It also considers gravity in local pose estimation which well constrains human global orientations and refines local pose estimation in a joint estimation manner. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate motion capture for both local poses and global motions. Furthermore, by deeply integrating physics, we can also estimate 3D contact, contact forces, joint torques, and interacting proxy surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025.

These developments have led to highly accurate body tracking systems, which have direct applications in sports analysis and performance evaluation. This work analyzes the performance of six trackers: two point trackers and four joint trackers for biomechanical analysis in sprints. The proposed framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames. The experimental framework employs forty sprints from five professional runners, focusing on three key angles in sprint biomechanics: trunk inclination, hip flex extension, and knee flex extension. We propose a post-processing module for outlier detection and fusion prediction in the joint angles. The experimental results demonstrate that using joint-based models yields root mean squared errors ranging from 11.41{\deg} to 4.37{\deg}. When integrated with the post-processing modules, these errors can be reduced to 6.99{\deg} and 3.88{\deg}, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that human pose tracking approaches can be valuable resources for the biomechanical analysis of running. However, there is still room for improvement in applications where high accuracy is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the paper presented to the Third Workshop on Learning with Few or Without Annotated Face, Body, and Gesture Data on 19th IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition 2025</p></details> |

HDiffTG leverages the strengths of these techniques to significantly improve pose estimation accuracy and robustness while maintaining a lightweight design. The Transformer captures global spatiotemporal dependencies, the GCN models local skeletal structures, and the diffusion model provides step-by-step optimization for fine-tuning, achieving a complementary balance between global and local features.

While deep learning-based human pose estimation (HPE) models from RGB videos have achieved impressive performance on public datasets, their effectiveness in real-world sports scenarios is often hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts across different pose representations. Fine-tuning these models can partially alleviate such challenges but typically requires large-scale annotated data and still struggles to generalize across diverse sports environments. To address these limitations, we propose a 2D pose prior-guided refinement approach based on Neural Distance Fields (NDF). Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on angular representations of human poses, we introduce a polar coordinate-based representation that explicitly incorporates joint connection lengths, enabling a more accurate correction of erroneous pose estimations. Additionally, we define a novel non-geodesic distance metric that separates angular and radial discrepancies, which we demonstrate is better suited for polar representations than traditional geodesic distances. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a gradient-based batch-projection augmentation strategy, which synthesizes realistic pose samples through iterative refinement. Our method is evaluated on a long jump dataset, demonstrating its ability to improve 2D pose estimation across multiple pose representations, making it robust across different domains. Experimental results show that our approach enhances pose plausibility while requiring only limited training data.

Traditional regression-based methods assume fixed distributions, which might lead to poor UQ. Heatmap-based methods effectively model the output distribution using likelihood heatmaps, however, they demand significant resources. To address this, we propose Continuous Flow Residual Estimation (CFRE), an integration of Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) into regression-based models, which allows for dynamic distribution adaptation. Through extensive experiments, we show that CFRE leads to better accuracy and uncertainty quantification with retained computational efficiency on both 2D and 3D human pose estimation tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by SCIA2025 |
| **[3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial Graph Order Attention and Temporal Body Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01003v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, Transformers and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are the prevailing techniques for 3D human pose estimation. However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Each insole, fabricated with e-textile garment techniques, costs under USD 1, making it significantly cheaper than commercial alternatives and ideal for large-scale production. Our approach uses foot pressure distribution, acceleration, and rotation data to overcome limitations, providing a lightweight, minimally intrusive, and privacy-aware solution. The system employs a Transformer model for efficient temporal feature extraction, enriched by first and second derivatives in the input stream. Including multimodal information, such as accelerometers and rotational measurements, improves the accuracy of complex motion pattern recognition. These facts are demonstrated experimentally, while error metrics show the robustness of the approach in various posture estimation tasks. This work could be the foundation for a low-cost, practical application in rehabilitation, injury prevention, and health monitoring while enabling further development through sensor optimization and expanded datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDM: A Metric for Comparing 3D Shapes Using Directional Distance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09736v5)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Qualifying the discrepancy between 3D geometric models, which could be represented with either point clouds or triangle meshes, is a pivotal issue with board applications. Existing methods mainly focus on directly establishing the correspondence between two models and then aggregating point-wise distance between corresponding points, resulting in them being either inefficient or ineffective. In this paper, we propose DDM, an efficient, effective, robust, and differentiable distance metric for 3D geometry data. Specifically, we construct DDM based on the proposed implicit representation of 3D models, namely directional distance field (DDF), which defines the directional distances of 3D points to a model to capture its local surface geometry. We then transfer the discrepancy between two 3D geometric models as the discrepancy between their DDFs defined on an identical domain, naturally establishing model correspondence. To demonstrate the advantage of our DDM, we explore various distance metric-driven 3D geometric modeling tasks, including template surface fitting, rigid registration, non-rigid registration, scene flow estimation and human pose optimization. Extensive experiments show that our DDM achieves significantly higher accuracy under all tasks. As a generic distance metric, DDM has the potential to advance the field of 3D geometric modeling.

| **[Dance Style Recognition Using Laban Movement Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21166v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing interest in automated movement analysis has presented new challenges in recognition of complex human activities including dance. This study focuses on dance style recognition using features extracted using Laban Movement Analysis. Previous studies for dance style recognition often focus on cross-frame movement analysis, which limits the ability to capture temporal context and dynamic transitions between movements. This gap highlights the need for a method that can add temporal context to LMA features. For this, we introduce a novel pipeline which combines 3D pose estimation, 3D human mesh reconstruction, and floor aware body modeling to effectively extract LMA features. To address the temporal limitation, we propose a sliding window approach that captures movement evolution across time in features. These features are then used to train various machine learning methods for classification, and their explainability explainable AI methods to evaluate the contribution of each feature to classification performance. Our proposed method achieves a highest classification accuracy of 99.18\% which shows that the addition of temporal context significantly improves dance style recognition performance.</p></details> |  |

Many challenges make the reconstruction difficult due to (1) actors occluding with each other and having diverse facial expressions, (2) cluttered stages, and (3) small baseline views or sudden shot changes. To address these issues, we present ShowMak3r, a comprehensive reconstruction pipeline that allows the editing of scenes like how video clips are made in a production control room. In ShowMak3r, a 3DLocator module locates recovered actors on the stage using depth prior and estimates unseen human poses via interpolation. The proposed ShotMatcher module then tracks the actors under shot changes. Furthermore, ShowMak3r introduces a face-fitting network that dynamically recovers the actors' expressions. Experiments on Sitcoms3D dataset show that our pipeline can reassemble TV show scenes with new cameras at different timestamps. We also demonstrate that ShowMak3r enables interesting applications such as synthetic shot-making, actor relocation, insertion, deletion, and pose manipulation.

While existing research primarily focuses on reducing estimation errors, it largely neglects robustness and security aspects, leaving these systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To address this significant challenge, we propose the \textbf{Tangible Attack (TBA)}, a novel framework designed to generate adversarial examples capable of effectively compromising any digital human generation model. Our approach introduces a \textbf{Dual Heterogeneous Noise Generator (DHNG)}, which leverages Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and ControlNet to produce diverse, targeted noise tailored to the original image features. Additionally, we design a custom \textbf{adversarial loss function} to optimize the noise, ensuring both high controllability and potent disruption. By iteratively refining the adversarial sample through multi-gradient signals from both the noise and the state-of-the-art EHPS model, TBA substantially improves the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate TBA's superiority, achieving a remarkable 41.0\% increase in estimation error, with an average improvement of approximately 17.0\%. These findings expose significant security vulnerabilities in current EHPS models and highlight the need for stronger defenses in digital human generation systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

In this study, we proposed a novel architecture named Transformer based Encoder Decoder Network (TED Net) designed for estimating human skeleton poses from WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). TED Net integrates convolutional encoders with transformer based attention mechanisms to capture spatiotemporal features from CSI signals. The estimated skeleton poses were used as input to a customized Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) for action recognition. We validated our model on two datasets: a publicly available multi modal dataset for assessing general pose estimation, and a newly collected dataset focused on fall related scenarios involving 20 participants. Experimental results demonstrated that TED Net outperformed existing approaches in pose estimation, and that the DGNN achieves reliable action classification using CSI based skeletons, with performance comparable to RGB based systems. Notably, TED Net maintains robust performance across both fall and non fall cases. These findings highlight the potential of CSI driven human skeleton estimation for effective action recognition, particularly in home environments such as elderly fall detection. In such settings, WiFi signals are often readily available, offering a privacy preserving alternative to vision based methods, which may raise concerns about continuous camera monitoring.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Although utilizing facial landmarks is valuable for this purpose, existing landmark-based methods prioritize precision over simplicity and model size, limiting their deployment on edge devices and in compute-poor environments. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Grouped Attention Deep Sets (GADS)}, a novel architecture based on the Deep Set framework. By grouping landmarks into regions and employing small Deep Set layers, we reduce computational complexity. Our multihead attention mechanism extracts and combines inter-group information, resulting in a model that is $7.5\times$ smaller and executes $25\times$ faster than the current lightest state-of-the-art model. Notably, our method achieves an impressive reduction, being $4321\times$ smaller than the best-performing model. We introduce vanilla GADS and Hybrid-GADS (landmarks + RGB) and evaluate our models on three benchmark datasets -- AFLW2000, BIWI, and 300W-LP. We envision our architecture as a robust baseline for resource-constrained head pose estimation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 tables, 10 figures, not submitted to any conference or journal</p></details> |

Recent neural rendering advances have enabled holistic human-scene reconstruction but require pre-calibrated camera and human poses, and days of training time. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality. Experiments on the EMDB and NeuMan datasets demonstrate superior or on-par performance with existing methods in camera tracking, human pose estimation, novel view synthesis and runtime.

Among these factors, camera viewpoints and locations {have been shown} to contribute significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained model.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, including appendix.

However, as these techniques migrate towards lower-fidelity IMUs on ubiquitous commodity devices, like phones, watches, and earbuds, challenges arise including compromised online performance, temporal consistency, and loss of global translation due to sensor noise and drift. Addressing these challenges, we introduce MobilePoser, a real-time system for full-body pose and global translation estimation using any available subset of IMUs already present in these consumer devices. MobilePoser employs a multi-stage deep neural network for kinematic pose estimation followed by a physics-based motion optimizer, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while remaining lightweight. We conclude with a series of demonstrative applications to illustrate the unique potential of MobilePoser across a variety of fields, such as health and wellness, gaming, and indoor navigation to name a few.</p></details> |  |
| **[GST: Precise 3D Human Body from a Single Image with Gaussian Splatting Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04196v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing posed 3D human models from monocular images has important applications in the sports industry, including performance tracking, injury prevention and virtual training. In this work, we combine 3D human pose and shape estimation with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a representation of the scene composed of a mixture of Gaussians. This allows training or fine-tuning a human model predictor on multi-view images alone, without 3D ground truth. Predicting such mixtures for a human from a single input image is challenging due to self-occlusions and dependence on articulations, while also needing to retain enough flexibility to accommodate a variety of clothes and poses. Our key observation is that the vertices of standardized human meshes (such as SMPL) can provide an adequate spatial density and approximate initial position for the Gaussians. We can then train a transformer model to jointly predict comparatively small adjustments to these positions, as well as the other 3DGS attributes and the SMPL parameters. We show empirically that this combination (using only multi-view supervision) can achieve near real-time inference of 3D human models from a single image without expensive diffusion models or 3D points supervision, thus making it ideal for the sport industry at any level. More importantly, rendering is an effective auxiliary objective to refine 3D pose estimation by accounting for clothes and other geometric variations.

Users have the possibility to access the entire Mixed Reality (MR) continuum. Goal of the human-computer-interaction (HCI) community is to allow natural and intuitive interactions but in general interactions for XR often rely on handheld controllers. One natural interaction method is full body tracking (FBT), where a user can use their body to interact with the experience. Classically, FBT systems require markers or trackers on the users to capture motion. Recently, there have been approaches based on Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which highlight the potential of low-cost non-intrusive FBT for XR. Due to the lack of handheld devices, HPE may also improve accessibility with people struggling with traditional input methods. This paper proposes the concept of non-intrusive FBT for XR for all.

However, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present significant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional anonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data utility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal privacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied naively. In this work, we present the first differentially private 2D human pose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance, we adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace. Additionally, we adapt TinyViT, a compact and efficient vision transformer for coordinate classification in HPE, providing a lightweight yet powerful backbone that enhances privacy-preserving deployment feasibility on resource-limited devices. Our approach is particularly valuable for multimedia interpretation tasks, enabling privacy-safe analysis and understanding of human motion across diverse visual media while preserving the semantic meaning required for downstream applications. Comprehensive experiments on the MPII Human Pose Dataset demonstrate significant performance enhancement with PDP-SGD achieving 78.48% PCKh@0.5 at a strict privacy budget ($\epsilon=0.2$), compared to 63.85% for standard DP-SGD. This work lays foundation for privacy-preserving human pose estimation in real-world, sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |

Using a novel synthetic dataset, BlendMimic3D, which includes diverse scenarios with multi-camera setups and several occlusion types, we conduct specific tests on several state-of-the-art models. Our study focuses on the discrepancy in keypoint formats between common datasets such as Human3.6M, and 2D datasets such as COCO, commonly used for 2D detection models and frequently input of 3D HPE models. Our work explores the impact of occlusions on model performance and the generality of models trained exclusively under standard conditions. The findings suggest significant sensitivity to occlusions and camera settings, revealing a need for models that better adapt to real-world variability and occlusion scenarios. This research contributed to ongoing efforts to improve the fidelity and applicability of 3D HPE systems in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Advancements in neural networks have significantly alleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports broadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it depends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive game analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match recordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to identify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's flying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying on human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or unavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration method capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted an existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to accurately track player movements. Together, these contributions enable the full 3D reconstruction of a table tennis rally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVSport 2025</p></details> |

However, most SOTA human mesh estimation (HME) models output a slightly different, thus inconsistent basic body shape for each video frame. Furthermore, we find that SOTA 3D human pose estimation (HPE) models outperform HME models regarding the precision of the estimated 3D keypoint positions. We solve the problem of inconsistent body shapes by leveraging anthropometric measurements like taken by tailors from humans. We create a model called A2B that converts given anthropometric measurements to basic body shape parameters of human mesh models. We obtain superior and consistent human meshes by combining the A2B model results with the keypoints of 3D HPE models using inverse kinematics. We evaluate our approach on challenging datasets like ASPset or fit3D, where we can lower the MPJPE by over 30 mm compared to SOTA HME models. Further, replacing estimates of the body shape parameters from existing HME models with A2B results not only increases the performance of these HME models, but also guarantees consistent body shapes.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for CVSports@CVPR'25</p></details> |

While Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) models can estimate joint rotations, they often exhibit lower accuracy in joint localization compared to 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) models. Recent work addressed this limitation by combining a 3D HPE model with inverse kinematics (IK) to estimate both joint locations and rotations. However, IK is computationally expensive. To overcome this, we propose a novel 2D-to-3D uplifting model that directly estimates 3D human poses, including joint rotations, in a single forward pass. We investigate multiple rotation representations, loss functions, and training strategies - both with and without access to ground truth rotations. Our models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in rotation estimation, are 150 times faster than the IK-based approach, and surpass HMR models in joint localization precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at CVSports@CVPR'25</p></details> |

Existing methods predominantly rely on Transformer-based architectures, which suffer from quadratic complexity in self-attention, leading to substantial computational overhead, especially in multi-person scenarios. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative to Transformers due to its efficient global modeling capability. However, it remains limited in capturing fine-grained local dependencies, which are essential for precise EHPS. To address these issues, we propose EMO-X, the Efficient Multi-person One-stage model for multi-person EHPS. Specifically, we explore a Scan-based Global-Local Decoder (SGLD) that integrates global context with skeleton-aware local features to iteratively enhance human tokens. Our EMO-X leverages the superior global modeling capability of Mamba and designs a local bidirectional scan mechanism for skeleton-aware local refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that EMO-X strikes an excellent balance between efficiency and accuracy. Notably, it achieves a significant reduction in computational complexity, requiring 69.8% less inference time compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, while outperforming most of them in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches primarily aim to enhance the performance of estimated 2D poses, they often struggle when applied to ground-truth 2D pose data. We observe that achieving accurate 3D pose reconstruction from ground-truth 2D poses requires precise modeling of local pose structures, alongside the ability to extract robust global spatio-temporal features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Hyper-GCN and Shuffle Mamba (HGMamba) block, which processes input data through two parallel streams: Hyper-GCN and Shuffle-Mamba. The Hyper-GCN stream models the human body structure as hypergraphs with varying levels of granularity to effectively capture local joint dependencies. Meanwhile, the Shuffle Mamba stream leverages a state space model to perform spatio-temporal scanning across all joints, enabling the establishment of global dependencies. By adaptively fusing these two representations, HGMamba achieves strong global feature modeling while excelling at local structure modeling. We stack multiple HGMamba blocks to create three variants of our model, allowing users to select the most suitable configuration based on the desired speed-accuracy trade-off. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Existing approaches lack mechanisms to incorporate auxiliary "side information" that could enhance reconstruction accuracy in such challenging scenarios. Furthermore, the most accurate methods rely on cropped person detections and cannot exploit scene context while methods that process the whole image often fail to detect people and are less accurate than methods that use crops. While recent language-based methods explore HPS reasoning through large language or vision-language models, their metric accuracy is well below the state of the art. In contrast, we present PromptHMR, a transformer-based promptable method that reformulates HPS estimation through spatial and semantic prompts. Our method processes full images to maintain scene context and accepts multiple input modalities: spatial prompts like bounding boxes and masks, and semantic prompts like language descriptions or interaction labels. PromptHMR demonstrates robust performance across challenging scenarios: estimating people from bounding boxes as small as faces in crowded scenes, improving body shape estimation through language descriptions, modeling person-person interactions, and producing temporally coherent motions in videos. Experiments on benchmarks show that PromptHMR achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering flexible prompt-based control over the HPS estimation process.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant progress in pose estimation algorithms targeting adults, such developments for infants remain limited. Existing algorithms for infant pose estimation, despite achieving commendable performance, depend on fully supervised approaches that require large amounts of labeled data. These algorithms also struggle with poor generalizability under distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce SHIFT: Leveraging SyntHetic Adult Datasets for Unsupervised InFanT Pose Estimation, which leverages the pseudo-labeling-based Mean-Teacher framework to compensate for the lack of labeled data and addresses distribution shifts by enforcing consistency between the student and the teacher pseudo-labels. Additionally, to penalize implausible predictions obtained from the mean-teacher framework, we incorporate an infant manifold pose prior. To enhance SHIFT's self-occlusion perception ability, we propose a novel visibility consistency module for improved alignment of the predicted poses with the original image.

We introduce a hybrid approach that incorporates body-part segmentation into the mesh fitting process, enhancing both human pose estimation and segmentation accuracy. Our method first assigns body part labels to individual points, which then guide a two-step SMPL-X fitting: initial pose and orientation estimation using body part centroids, followed by global refinement of the point cloud alignment. Additionally, we demonstrate that the fitted human mesh can refine body part labels, leading to improved segmentation.

To address this issue, this study proposes a novel cooperative inference method for real-time 3D human pose estimation in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. In the proposed method, multiple end devices equipped with lightweight inference models employ dual confidence thresholds to filter ambiguous images. Only the filtered images are offloaded to an edge server with a more powerful inference model for re-evaluation, thereby improving the estimation accuracy under computational and communication constraints. We numerically analyze the performance of the proposed inference method in terms of the inference accuracy and end-to-end delay and formulate a joint optimization problem to derive the optimal confidence thresholds and transmission time for each device, with the objective of minimizing the mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) while satisfying the required end-to-end delay constraint. To solve this problem, we demonstrate that minimizing the MPJPE is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the inference accuracies for all devices, decompose the problem into manageable subproblems, and present a low-complexity optimization algorithm to obtain a near-optimal solution. The experimental results show that a trade-off exists between the MPJPE and end-to-end delay depending on the confidence thresholds. Furthermore, the results confirm that the proposed cooperative inference method achieves a significant reduction in the MPJPE through the optimal selection of confidence thresholds and transmission times, while consistently satisfying the end-to-end delay requirement in various MEC environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |

Monocular 3D human pose estimation is challenged by depth ambiguity, limited 3D-labeled training data, imbalanced modeling, and restricted model generalization. To address these limitations, our work introduces a groundbreaking motion pre-training method based on contextualized representation learning. Specifically, our method involves masking 2D pose features and utilizing a Transformer-GCN dual-stream model to learn high-dimensional representations through a self-distillation setup. By focusing on contextualized representation learning and spatial-temporal modeling, our approach enhances the model's ability to understand spatial-temporal relationships between postures, resulting in superior generalization. Furthermore, leveraging the Transformer-GCN dual-stream model, our approach effectively balances global and local interactions in video pose estimation. The model adaptively integrates information from both the Transformer and GCN streams, where the GCN stream effectively learns local relationships between adjacent key points and frames, while the Transformer stream captures comprehensive global spatial and temporal features. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, with an MPJPE of 38.0mm and P-MPJPE of 31.9mm on Human3.6M, and an MPJPE of 15.9mm on MPI-INF-3DHP. Furthermore, visual experiments on public datasets and in-the-wild videos demonstrate the robustness and generalization capabilities of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiPART: Hierarchical Pose AutoRegressive Transformer for Occluded 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23331v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 2D-to-3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods struggle with the occlusion issue by enriching information like temporal and visual cues in the lifting stage. In this paper, we argue that these methods ignore the limitation of the sparse skeleton 2D input representation, which fundamentally restricts the 2D-to-3D lifting and worsens the occlusion issue. To address these, we propose a novel two-stage generative densification method, named Hierarchical Pose AutoRegressive Transformer (HiPART), to generate hierarchical 2D dense poses from the original sparse 2D pose. Specifically, we first develop a multi-scale skeleton tokenization module to quantize the highly dense 2D pose into hierarchical tokens and propose a Skeleton-aware Alignment to strengthen token connections. We then develop a Hierarchical AutoRegressive Modeling scheme for hierarchical 2D pose generation. With generated hierarchical poses as inputs for 2D-to-3D lifting, the proposed method shows strong robustness in occluded scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-frame-based 3D HPE. Moreover, it outperforms numerous multi-frame methods while reducing parameter and computational complexity and can also complement them to further enhance performance and robustness.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

However,most of the existing methods are computationally expensive or have complex architecture. Here we propose a lightweight attention based pose estimation network that utilizes depthwise separable convolution and Convolutional Block Attention Module on an hourglass backbone. The network significantly reduces the computational complexity (floating point operations) and the model size (number of parameters) containing only about 10% of parameters of original eight stack Hourglass network. Experiments were conducted on COCO and MPII datasets using a two stack hourglass backbone. The results showed that our model performs well in comparison to six other lightweight pose estimation models with an average precision of 72.07. The model achieves this performance with only 2.3M parameters and 3.7G FLOPs.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods depend on specialized equipment such as force plates and sensors, which makes accurate assessments both expensive and restricted to laboratory settings. In this paper, we introduce ForcePose, a novel deep learning framework that estimates applied forces by combining human pose estimation with object detection. Our approach leverages MediaPipe for skeletal tracking and SSD MobileNet for object recognition to create a unified representation of human-object interaction. We've developed a specialized neural network that processes both spatial and temporal features to predict force magnitude and direction without needing any physical sensors. After training on our dataset of 850 annotated videos with corresponding force measurements, our model achieves a mean absolute error of 5.83 N in force magnitude and 7.4 degrees in force direction. When compared to existing computer vision approaches, our method performs 27.5% better while still offering real-time performance on standard computing hardware. ForcePose opens up new possibilities for force analysis in diverse real-world scenarios where traditional measurement tools are impractical or intrusive. This paper discusses our methodology, the dataset creation process, evaluation metrics, and potential applications across rehabilitation, ergonomics assessment, and athletic performance analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skeleton-Based Transformer for Classification of Errors and Better Feedback in Low Back Pain Physical Rehabilitation Exercises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13866v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical rehabilitation exercises suggested by healthcare professionals can help recovery from various musculoskeletal disorders and prevent re-injury. However, patients' engagement tends to decrease over time without direct supervision, which is why there is a need for an automated monitoring system. In recent years, there has been great progress in quality assessment of physical rehabilitation exercises. Most of them only provide a binary classification if the performance is correct or incorrect, and a few provide a continuous score. This information is not sufficient for patients to improve their performance. In this work, we propose an algorithm for error classification of rehabilitation exercises, thus making the first step toward more detailed feedback to patients. We focus on skeleton-based exercise assessment, which utilizes human pose estimation to evaluate motion. Inspired by recent algorithms for quality assessment during rehabilitation exercises, we propose a Transformer-based model for the described classification. Our model is inspired by the HyperFormer method for human action recognition, and adapted to our problem and dataset. The evaluation is done on the KERAAL dataset, as it is the only medical dataset with clear error labels for the exercises, and our model significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we bridge the gap towards better feedback to the patients by presenting a way to calculate the importance of joints for each exercise.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICORR...</summary><p>ICORR 2025 - 19th IEEE/RAS-EMBS International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics, INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM FOR REHABILITATION ROBOTICS, May 2025, Michigan, USA, United States</p></details> |

However, SAM incurs twice the computational cost compared to base optimizer (e.g., SGD). We propose Asymptotic Unbiased Sampling with respect to iterations to accelerate SAM (AUSAM), which maintains the model's generalization capacity while significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Concretely, we probabilistically sample a subset of data points beneficial for SAM optimization based on a theoretically guaranteed criterion, i.e., the Gradient Norm of each Sample (GNS). We further approximate the GNS by the difference in loss values before and after perturbation in SAM. As a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic method, our approach consistently accelerates SAM across a range of tasks and networks, i.e., classification, human pose estimation and network quantization. On CIFAR10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet, AUSAM achieves results comparable to SAM while providing a speedup of over 70%. Compared to recent dynamic data pruning methods, AUSAM is better suited for SAM and excels in maintaining performance. Additionally, AUSAM accelerates optimization in human pose estimation and model quantization without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Humans with a Biomechanically Accurate Skeleton](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21751v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a method for reconstructing 3D humans from a single image using a biomechanically accurate skeleton model. To achieve this, we train a transformer that takes an image as input and estimates the parameters of the model. Due to the lack of training data for this task, we build a pipeline to produce pseudo ground truth model parameters for single images and implement a training procedure that iteratively refines these pseudo labels. Compared to state-of-the-art methods for 3D human mesh recovery, our model achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, while it significantly outperforms them in settings with extreme 3D poses and viewpoints. Additionally, we show that previous reconstruction methods frequently violate joint angle limits, leading to unnatural rotations. In contrast, our approach leverages the biomechanically plausible degrees of freedom making more realistic joint rotation estimates. We validate our approach across multiple human pose estimation benchmarks.

| **[Zero-Shot Human-Object Interaction Synthesis with Multimodal Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20118v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-object interaction (HOI) synthesis is important for various applications, ranging from virtual reality to robotics. However, acquiring 3D HOI data is challenging due to its complexity and high cost, limiting existing methods to the narrow diversity of object types and interaction patterns in training datasets. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot HOI synthesis framework without relying on end-to-end training on currently limited 3D HOI datasets. The core idea of our method lies in leveraging extensive HOI knowledge from pre-trained Multimodal Models. Given a text description, our system first obtains temporally consistent 2D HOI image sequences using image or video generation models, which are then uplifted to 3D HOI milestones of human and object poses. We employ pre-trained human pose estimation models to extract human poses and introduce a generalizable category-level 6-DoF estimation method to obtain the object poses from 2D HOI images. Our estimation method is adaptive to various object templates obtained from text-to-3D models or online retrieval. A physics-based tracking of the 3D HOI kinematic milestone is further applied to refine both body motions and object poses, yielding more physically plausible HOI generation results. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating open-vocabulary HOIs with physical realism and semantic diversity.</p></details> |  |

There is rapid development of human pose estimation methods in computer vision thanks to advances in deep learning and machine learning. However, these methods are trained on datasets that feature adults in different contexts. This work tests and compares seven popular methods (AlphaPose, DeepLabCut/DeeperCut, Detectron2, HRNet, MediaPipe/BlazePose, OpenPose, and ViTPose) on videos of infants in supine position and in more complex settings. Surprisingly, all methods except DeepLabCut and MediaPipe have competitive performance without additional finetuning, with ViTPose performing best. Next to standard performance metrics (average precision and recall), we introduce errors expressed in the neck-mid-hip (torso length) ratio and additionally study missed and redundant detections, and the reliability of the internal confidence ratings of the different methods, which are relevant for downstream tasks. Among the networks with competitive performance, only AlphaPose could run close to real time (27 fps) on our machine. We provide documented Docker containers or instructions for all the methods we used, our analysis scripts, and the processed data at https://hub.docker.com/u/humanoidsctu and https://osf.io/x465b/.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 20 tables</p></details> |

Since calibrating multiple cameras and finding matches across their views are inherently interdependent, performing both in a unified framework poses a significant challenge. We address these issues as a single registration problem of matching two sets of 3D points, leveraging human motion in dynamic multi-person scenes. To this end, we utilize 3D human poses obtained from an off-the-shelf monocular 3D human pose estimator and transform them into 3D points on a unit sphere, to solve the rotation, time offset, and the association alternatingly. We employ a probabilistic approach that can jointly solve both problems of aligning spatiotemporal data and establishing correspondences through soft assignment between two views. The translation is determined by applying coplanarity constraints. The pairwise registration results are integrated into a multiview setup, and then a nonlinear optimization method is used to improve the accuracy of the camera poses, temporal offsets, and multi-person associations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method as a practical marker-free calibration tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Primarily, this comparative analysis aims to validate the use of marker-less MoCap techniques in a clinical setting by showing that these marker-less techniques are within a reasonable range for kinematics analysis compared to the more cumbersome and less portable state-of-the-art tools. Not only does marker-less motion capture using human pose estimation produce results in-line with the results of both the IMU and MoCap kinematics but also benefits from a reduced set-up time and reduced practical knowledge and expertise to set up. Overall, while there is still room for improvement when it comes to the quality of the data produced, we believe that this compromise is within the room of error that these low-speed actions that are used in small clinical tests.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Sparse Correlation and Joint Distillation (SCJD), a novel framework that balances efficiency and accuracy for 3D HPE. SCJD introduces Sparse Correlation Input Sequence Downsampling to reduce redundancy in student network inputs while preserving inter-frame correlations. For effective knowledge transfer, we propose Dynamic Joint Spatial Attention Distillation, which includes Dynamic Joint Embedding Distillation to enhance the student's feature representation using the teacher's multi-frame context feature, and Adjacent Joint Attention Distillation to improve the student network's focus on adjacent joint relationships for better spatial understanding. Additionally, Temporal Consistency Distillation aligns the temporal correlations between teacher and student networks through upsampling and global supervision.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed mentor-student relationships, our framework dynamically selects and adapts the teaching strategies of diverse mentors based on their effectiveness for each data sample. ClassroomKD comprises two main modules: the Knowledge Filtering (KF) module and the Mentoring module. The KF Module dynamically ranks mentors based on their performance for each input, activating only high-quality mentors to minimize error accumulation and prevent information loss. The Mentoring Module adjusts the distillation strategy by tuning each mentor's influence according to the dynamic performance gap between the student and mentors, effectively modulating the learning pace. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and 2D human pose estimation (COCO Keypoints and MPII Human Pose) demonstrate that ClassroomKD outperforms existing knowledge distillation methods for different network architectures. Our results highlight that a dynamic and adaptive approach to mentor selection and guidance leads to more effective knowledge transfer, paving the way for enhanced model performance through distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IntelliSys 2025</p></details> |

Traditional gun detection methods rely on manual inspections and continuous human monitoring of CCTV footage, which are labor-intensive and prone to high false positive and negative rates. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates human pose estimation with weapon appearance recognition using deep learning techniques. Unlike prior studies that focus on either body pose estimation or firearm detection in isolation, our method jointly analyzes posture and weapon presence to enhance detection accuracy in real-world, dynamic environments. To train our model, we curated a diverse dataset comprising images from open-source repositories such as IMFDB and Monash Guns, supplemented with AI-generated and manually collected images from web sources. This dataset ensures robust generalization and realistic performance evaluation under various surveillance conditions. Our research aims to improve the precision and reliability of firearm detection systems, contributing to enhanced public safety and threat mitigation in high-risk areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring Your Rear Cameras for Egocentric 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11652v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric 3D human pose estimation has been actively studied using cameras installed in front of a head-mounted device (HMD). While frontal placement is the optimal and the only option for some tasks, such as hand tracking, it remains unclear if the same holds for full-body tracking due to self-occlusion and limited field-of-view coverage. Notably, even the state-of-the-art methods often fail to estimate accurate 3D poses in many scenarios, such as when HMD users tilt their heads upward (a common motion in human activities). A key limitation of existing HMD designs is their neglect of the back of the body, despite its potential to provide crucial 3D reconstruction cues. Hence, this paper investigates the usefulness of rear cameras in the HMD design for full-body tracking. We also show that simply adding rear views to the frontal inputs is not optimal for existing methods due to their dependence on individual 2D joint detectors without effective multi-view integration. To address this issue, we propose a new transformer-based method that refines 2D joint heatmap estimation with multi-view information and heatmap uncertainty, thereby improving 3D pose tracking. Moreover, we introduce two new large-scale datasets, Ego4View-Syn and Ego4View-RW, for a rear-view evaluation. Our experiments show that the new camera configurations with back views provide superior support for 3D pose tracking compared to only frontal placements. The proposed method achieves significant improvement over the current state of the art (>10% on MPJPE). We will release the source code, trained models, and new datasets on our project page https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/EgoRear/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/EgoRear/</p></details> |

Ground truth 2D poses are used for adaptation, but only estimated 2D poses are available in practice. This paper addresses adapting models to streaming videos with estimated 2D poses. Comparing adaptations reveals the challenge of limiting estimation errors while preserving accurate pose information. To this end, we propose adaptive aggregation, a two-stage optimization, and local augmentation for handling varying levels of estimated pose error. First, we perform adaptive aggregation across videos to initialize the model state with labeled representative samples. Within each video, we use a two-stage optimization to benefit from 2D fitting while minimizing the impact of erroneous updates. Second, we employ local augmentation, using adjacent confident samples to update the model before adapting to the current non-confident sample. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art by a large margin, advancing adaptation towards more practical settings of using estimated 2D poses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refinement Module based on Parse Graph of Feature Map for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11069v4)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parse graphs of the human body can be obtained in the human brain to help humans complete the human Pose Estimation better (HPE). It contains a hierarchical structure, like a tree structure, and context relations among nodes. To equip models with such capabilities, many researchers predefine the parse graph of body structure to design HPE frameworks. However, these frameworks struggle to adapt to instances that deviate from the predefined parse graph and they are often parameter-heavy. Unlike them, we view the feature map holistically, much like the human body. It can be optimized using parse graphs, where nodes' implicit feature representation boosts adaptability, avoiding rigid structural limitations. In this paper, we design the Refinement Module based on the Parse Graph of feature map (RMPG), which includes two stages: top-down decomposition and bottom-up combination. In the first stage, the feature map is constructed into a tree structure through recursive decomposition, with each node representing a sub-feature map, thereby achieving hierarchical modeling of features. In the second stage, context information is calculated and sub-feature maps with context are recursively connected to gradually build a refined feature map. Additionally, we design a hierarchical network with fewer parameters using multiple RMPG modules to model the context relations and hierarchies in the parse graph of body structure for HPE, some of which are supervised to obtain context relations among body parts. Our network achieves excellent results on multiple mainstream human pose datasets and the effectiveness of RMPG is proven on different methods. The code of RMPG will be open.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenHPE: Generative Counterfactuals for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Radio Frequency Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09537v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation (HPE) detects the positions of human body joints for various applications. Compared to using cameras, HPE using radio frequency (RF) signals is non-intrusive and more robust to adverse conditions, exploiting the signal variations caused by human interference. However, existing studies focus on single-domain HPE confined by domain-specific confounders, which cannot generalize to new domains and result in diminished HPE performance. Specifically, the signal variations caused by different human body parts are entangled, containing subject-specific confounders. RF signals are also intertwined with environmental noise, involving environment-specific confounders. In this paper, we propose GenHPE, a 3D HPE approach that generates counterfactual RF signals to eliminate domain-specific confounders. GenHPE trains generative models conditioned on human skeleton labels, learning how human body parts and confounders interfere with RF signals. We manipulate skeleton labels (i.e., removing body parts) as counterfactual conditions for generative models to synthesize counterfactual RF signals. The differences between counterfactual signals approximately eliminate domain-specific confounders and regularize an encoder-decoder model to learn domain-independent representations. Such representations help GenHPE generalize to new subjects/environments for cross-domain 3D HPE. We evaluate GenHPE on three public datasets from WiFi, ultra-wideband, and millimeter wave. Experimental results show that GenHPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces estimation errors by up to 52.2mm for cross-subject HPE and 10.6mm for cross-environment HPE.</p></details> |  |

Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models.

While prior art usually solves these problems separately, we argue that joint optimization of skeletal motion with a 3D renderable body model brings synergistic effects, i.e. yields more precise motion capture and improved visual quality of real-time rendering of avatars. To achieve this, we introduce a novel animatable avatar with 3D Gaussians rigged on a personalized mesh and propose to optimize the motion sequence with time-dependent MLPs that provide accurate and temporally consistent pose estimates. We first evaluate our method on highly challenging yoga poses and demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on multi-view human pose estimation, reducing error by 35% on body joints and 45% on hand joints compared to keypoint-based methods. At the same time, our method significantly boosts the visual quality of animatable avatars (+2dB PSNR on novel view synthesis) on diverse challenging subjects.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Existing methods always struggle with either low rendering qualities (\eg, visual fidelity and physically plausible HOIs) or high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose HOGS (Human-Object Rendering via 3D Gaussian Splatting), a novel framework for efficient and physically plausible HOI rendering from sparse views. Specifically, HOGS combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with a physics-aware optimization process. It incorporates a Human Pose Refinement module for accurate pose estimation and a Sparse-View Human-Object Contact Prediction module for efficient contact region identification. This combination enables coherent joint rendering of human and object Gaussians while enforcing physically plausible interactions. Extensive experiments on the HODome dataset demonstrate that HOGS achieves superior rendering quality, efficiency, and physical plausibility compared to existing methods. We further show its extensibility to hand-object grasp rendering tasks, presenting its broader applicability to articulated object interactions.</p></details> |  |

While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%. We also validate the kinematic accuracy of monocular pose estimations through waveform analysis, highlighting strong correlations in joint angle estimations but limitations in velocity estimation. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of monocular pose estimation models in the context of sports, contributing valuable insights for advancing monocular pose estimation techniques in high-performance sports environments.

Such long-sequence in-the-wild motions are highly valuable to applications such as motion generation and motion understanding, but are of great challenge to be recovered due to abrupt shot transitions, partial occlusions, and dynamic backgrounds presented in such videos. Existing methods primarily focus on single-shot videos, where continuity is maintained within a single camera view, or simplify multi-shot alignment in camera space only. In this work, we tackle the challenges by integrating an enhanced camera pose estimation with Human Motion Recovery (HMR) by incorporating a shot transition detector and a robust alignment module for accurate pose and orientation continuity across shots. By leveraging a custom motion integrator, we effectively mitigate the problem of foot sliding and ensure temporal consistency in human pose. Extensive evaluations on our created multi-shot dataset from public 3D human datasets demonstrate the robustness of our method in reconstructing realistic human motion in world coordinates.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project page: https://zhangyuhong01.github.io/HumanMM/</p></details> |
| **[Realistic Clothed Human and Object Joint Reconstruction from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18150v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to jointly reconstruct 3D humans and objects from a single RGB image represent 3D shapes with template-based or coarse models, which fail to capture details of loose clothing on human bodies. In this paper, we introduce a novel implicit approach for jointly reconstructing realistic 3D clothed humans and objects from a monocular view. For the first time, we model both the human and the object with an implicit representation, allowing to capture more realistic details such as clothing. This task is extremely challenging due to human-object occlusions and the lack of 3D information in 2D images, often leading to poor detail reconstruction and depth ambiguity. To address these problems, we propose a novel attention-based neural implicit model that leverages image pixel alignment from both the input human-object image for a global understanding of the human-object scene and from local separate views of the human and object images to improve realism with, for example, clothing details. Additionally, the network is conditioned on semantic features derived from an estimated human-object pose prior, which provides 3D spatial information about the shared space of humans and objects. To handle human occlusion caused by objects, we use a generative diffusion model that inpaints the occluded regions, recovering otherwise lost details. For training and evaluation, we introduce a synthetic dataset featuring rendered scenes of inter-occluded 3D human scans and diverse objects. Extensive evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates the superior quality of the proposed human-object reconstructions over competitive methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Humans as a Calibration Pattern: Dynamic 3D Scene Reconstruction from Unsynchronized and Uncalibrated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19089v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works on dynamic 3D neural field reconstruction assume the input from synchronized multi-view videos whose poses are known. The input constraints are often not satisfied in real-world setups, making the approach impractical. We show that unsynchronized videos from unknown poses can generate dynamic neural fields as long as the videos capture human motion. Humans are one of the most common dynamic subjects captured in videos, and their shapes and poses can be estimated using state-of-the-art libraries. While noisy, the estimated human shape and pose parameters provide a decent initialization point to start the highly non-convex and under-constrained problem of training a consistent dynamic neural representation. Given the shape and pose parameters of humans in individual frames, we formulate methods to calculate the time offsets between videos, followed by camera pose estimations that analyze the 3D joint positions. Then, we train the dynamic neural fields employing multiresolution grids while we concurrently refine both time offsets and camera poses. The setup still involves optimizing many parameters; therefore, we introduce a robust progressive learning strategy to stabilize the process. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate spatio-temporal calibration and high-quality scene reconstruction in challenging conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Grained Feature Pruning for Video-Based Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05365v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation, with its broad applications in action recognition and motion capture, has experienced significant advancements. However, current Transformer-based methods for video pose estimation often face challenges in managing redundant temporal information and achieving fine-grained perception because they only focus on processing low-resolution features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale resolution framework that encodes spatio-temporal representations at varying granularities and executes fine-grained perception compensation. Furthermore, we employ a density peaks clustering method to dynamically identify and prioritize tokens that offer important semantic information. This strategy effectively prunes redundant feature tokens, especially those arising from multi-frame features, thereby optimizing computational efficiency without sacrificing semantic richness. Empirically, it sets new benchmarks for both performance and efficiency on three large-scale datasets. Our method achieves a 93.8% improvement in inference speed compared to the baseline, while also enhancing pose estimation accuracy, reaching 87.4 mAP on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |  |

| **[BGM2Pose: Active 3D Human Pose Estimation with Non-Stationary Sounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00389v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose BGM2Pose, a non-invasive 3D human pose estimation method using arbitrary music (e.g., background music) as active sensing signals. Unlike existing approaches that significantly limit practicality by employing intrusive chirp signals within the audible range, our method utilizes natural music that causes minimal discomfort to humans. Estimating human poses from standard music presents significant challenges. In contrast to sound sources specifically designed for measurement, regular music varies in both volume and pitch. These dynamic changes in signals caused by music are inevitably mixed with alterations in the sound field resulting from human motion, making it hard to extract reliable cues for pose estimation. To address these challenges, BGM2Pose introduces a Contrastive Pose Extraction Module that employs contrastive learning and hard negative sampling to eliminate musical components from the recorded data, isolating the pose information. Additionally, we propose a Frequency-wise Attention Module that enables the model to focus on subtle acoustic variations attributable to human movement by dynamically computing attention across frequency bands. Experiments suggest that our method outperforms the existing methods, demonstrating substantial potential for real-world applications. Our datasets and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers with Joint Tokens and Local-Global Attention for Efficient Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00232v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have led to significant progress in 2D body pose estimation. However, achieving a good balance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness remains a challenge. For instance, CNNs are computationally efficient but struggle with long-range dependencies, while ViTs excel in capturing such dependencies but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper proposes two ViT-based models for accurate, efficient, and robust 2D pose estimation. The first one, EViTPose, operates in a computationally efficient manner without sacrificing accuracy by utilizing learnable joint tokens to select and process a subset of the most important body patches, enabling us to control the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency by changing the number of patches to be processed. The second one, UniTransPose, while not allowing for the same level of direct control over the trade-off, efficiently handles multiple scales by combining (1) an efficient multi-scale transformer encoder that uses both local and global attention with (2) an efficient sub-pixel CNN decoder for better speed and accuracy. Moreover, by incorporating all joints from different benchmarks into a unified skeletal representation, we train robust methods that learn from multiple datasets simultaneously and perform well across a range of scenarios -- including pose variations, lighting conditions, and occlusions. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods while improving computational efficiency. EViTPose exhibits a significant decrease in computational complexity (30% to 44% less in GFLOPs) with a minimal drop of accuracy (0% to 3.5% less), and UniTransPose achieves accuracy improvements ranging from 0.9% to 43.8% across these benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel video segmentation strategy to extract frames of each player's racket swing in a badminton broadcast match. These segmented frames are then processed by two existing models: one for Human Pose Estimation to obtain player skeletal joints, and the other for shuttlecock trajectory detection to extract shuttlecock trajectories. Leveraging these joints, trajectories, and player positions as inputs, we propose Badminton Stroke-type Transformer (BST) to classify player stroke-types in singles. To the best of our knowledge, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the largest publicly available badminton video dataset, ShuttleSet, which shows that effectively leveraging ball trajectory is likely to be a trend for racket sports action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (excluding references).

| **[Sixth-Sense: Self-Supervised Learning of Spatial Awareness of Humans from a Planar Lidar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21029v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localizing humans is a key prerequisite for any service robot operating in proximity to people. In these scenarios, robots rely on a multitude of state-of-the-art detectors usually designed to operate with RGB-D cameras or expensive 3D LiDARs. However, most commercially available service robots are equipped with cameras with a narrow field of view, making them blind when a user is approaching from other directions, or inexpensive 1D LiDARs whose readings are difficult to interpret. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised approach to detect humans and estimate their 2D pose from 1D LiDAR data, using detections from an RGB-D camera as a supervision source. Our approach aims to provide service robots with spatial awareness of nearby humans. After training on 70 minutes of data autonomously collected in two environments, our model is capable of detecting humans omnidirectionally from 1D LiDAR data in a novel environment, with 71% precision and 80% recall, while retaining an average absolute error of 13 cm in distance and 44{\deg} in orientation.</p></details> |  |
| **[STGFormer: Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer for 3D Human Pose Estimation in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10099v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current methods of video-based 3D human pose estimation have achieved significant progress.However, they still face pressing challenges, such as the underutilization of spatiotemporal bodystructure features in transformers and the inadequate granularity of spatiotemporal interaction modeling in graph convolutional networks, which leads to pervasive depth ambiguity in monocular 3D human pose estimation. To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose Magic: Efficient and Temporally Consistent Human Pose Estimation with a Hybrid Mamba-GCN Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02922v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) are primarily based on Transformers. However, existing Transformer-based 3D HPE backbones often encounter a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. To resolve the above dilemma, in this work, we leverage recent advances in state space models and utilize Mamba for high-quality and efficient long-range modeling. Nonetheless, Mamba still faces challenges in precisely exploiting local dependencies between joints. To address these issues, we propose a new attention-free hybrid spatiotemporal architecture named Hybrid Mamba-GCN (Pose Magic). This architecture introduces local enhancement with GCN by capturing relationships between neighboring joints, thus producing new representations to complement Mamba's outputs. By adaptively fusing representations from Mamba and GCN, Pose Magic demonstrates superior capability in learning the underlying 3D structure. To meet the requirements of real-time inference, we also provide a fully causal version. Extensive experiments show that Pose Magic achieves new SOTA results ($\downarrow 0.9 mm$) while saving $74.1\%$ FLOPs. In addition, Pose Magic exhibits optimal motion consistency and the ability to generalize to unseen sequence lengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

We argue that the increasing miniaturization of optical sensors will lead to the prolific integration of cameras into many more body-worn devices at various locations. This will bring fresh perspectives to established tasks in computer vision and benefit key areas such as human motion tracking, body pose estimation, or action recognition -- particularly for the lower body, which is typically occluded. In this paper, we introduce EgoSim, a novel simulator of body-worn cameras that generates realistic egocentric renderings from multiple perspectives across a wearer's body. A key feature of EgoSim is its use of real motion capture data to render motion artifacts, which are especially noticeable with arm- or leg-worn cameras. In addition, we introduce MultiEgoView, a dataset of egocentric footage from six body-worn cameras and ground-truth full-body 3D poses during several activities: 119 hours of data are derived from AMASS motion sequences in four high-fidelity virtual environments, which we augment with 5 hours of real-world motion data from 13 participants using six GoPro cameras and 3D body pose references from an Xsens motion capture suit. We demonstrate EgoSim's effectiveness by training an end-to-end video-only 3D pose estimation network. Analyzing its domain gap, we show that our dataset and simulator substantially aid training for inference on real-world data.

However, most existing methods do not operate well for testing images whose distribution is far from that of training data. This problem might be alleviated by involving diverse data during training, however it is non-trivial to collect such diverse data with corresponding labels (i.e. 3D pose). In this paper, we introduced an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 3D pose estimation that utilizes the unlabeled data in addition to labeled data via masked image modeling (MIM) framework. Foreground-centric reconstruction and attention regularization are further proposed to increase the effectiveness of unlabeled data usage. Experiments are conducted on the various datasets in human and hand pose estimation tasks, especially using the cross-domain scenario. We demonstrated the effectiveness of ours by achieving the state-of-the-art accuracy on all datasets.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

To predict a single output 3D pose sequence, we generate and aggregate multiple 3D pose hypotheses. For better aggregation results, we develop a method to score these hypotheses during training, effectively integrating conformal prediction into the learning process. This process results in a differentiable conformal predictor that is trained end2end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned scoring model is used as the conformity score, and the 3D pose estimator is combined with a conformal predictor to select the most accurate hypotheses for downstream aggregation. Our results indicate that using a simple mean aggregation on the conformal prediction-filtered hypotheses set yields competitive results. When integrated with more sophisticated aggregation techniques, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world scenarios, issues such as occlusion, noise interference, and missing viewpoints can severely affect pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce the task of Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation. Traditional 3D pose estimation methods often rely on multi-stage networks and modular combinations, which can lead to cumulative errors and increased training complexity, making them unable to effectively address deficiency-aware estimation. To this end, we propose DeProPose, a flexible method that simplifies the network architecture to reduce training complexity and avoid information loss in multi-stage designs. Additionally, the model innovatively introduces a multi-view feature fusion mechanism based on relative projection error, which effectively utilizes information from multiple viewpoints and dynamically assigns weights, enabling efficient integration and enhanced robustness to overcome deficiency-aware 3D Pose Estimation challenges. Furthermore, to thoroughly evaluate this end-to-end multi-view 3D human pose estimation model and to advance research on occlusion-related challenges, we have developed a novel 3D human pose estimation dataset, termed the Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation (DA-3DPE) dataset. This dataset encompasses a wide range of deficiency scenarios, including noise interference, missing viewpoints, and occlusion challenges. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, DeProPose not only excels in addressing the deficiency-aware problem but also shows improvement in conventional scenarios, providing a powerful and user-friendly solution for 3D human pose estimation.

In this paper, we introduce the challenge of unsupervised categorical prior learning in pose estimation, where AI models learn a general pose prior for an object category from images in a self-supervised manner. Although priors are effective in estimating pose, acquiring them can be difficult. We propose a novel method, named Pose Prior Learner (PPL), to learn a general pose prior for any object category. PPL uses a hierarchical memory to store compositional parts of prototypical poses, from which we distill a general pose prior. This prior improves pose estimation accuracy through template transformation and image reconstruction. PPL learns meaningful pose priors without any additional human annotations or interventions, outperforming competitive baselines on both human and animal pose estimation datasets. Notably, our experimental results reveal the effectiveness of PPL using learned prototypical poses for pose estimation on occluded images. Through iterative inference, PPL leverages the pose prior to refine estimated poses, regressing them to any prototypical poses stored in memory. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Though existing methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often exhibit limitations due to constrained dataset diversity and the restricted amount of information derived from audio inputs. To address these challenges, we present VarGes, a novel variation-driven framework designed to enhance co-speech gesture generation by integrating visual stylistic cues while maintaining naturalness. Our approach begins with the Variation-Enhanced Feature Extraction (VEFE) module, which seamlessly incorporates \textcolor{blue}{style-reference} video data into a 3D human pose estimation network to extract StyleCLIPS, thereby enriching the input with stylistic information. Subsequently, we employ the Variation-Compensation Style Encoder (VCSE), a transformer-style encoder equipped with an additive attention mechanism pooling layer, to robustly encode diverse StyleCLIPS representations and effectively manage stylistic variations. Finally, the Variation-Driven Gesture Predictor (VDGP) module fuses MFCC audio features with StyleCLIPS encodings via cross-attention, injecting this fused data into a cross-conditional autoregressive model to modulate 3D human gesture generation based on audio input and stylistic clues. The efficacy of our approach is validated on benchmark datasets, where it outperforms existing methods in terms of gesture diversity and naturalness. The code and video results will be made publicly available upon acceptance:https://github.com/mookerr/VarGES/ .</p></details> |  |
| **[X-Fi: A Modality-Invariant Foundation Model for Multimodal Human Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10167v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human sensing, which employs various sensors and advanced deep learning technologies to accurately capture and interpret human body information, has significantly impacted fields like public security and robotics. However, current human sensing primarily depends on modalities such as cameras and LiDAR, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Furthermore, existing multi-modal fusion solutions are typically designed for fixed modality combinations, requiring extensive retraining when modalities are added or removed for diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modality-invariant foundation model for all modalities, X-Fi, to address this issue. X-Fi enables the independent or combinatory use of sensor modalities without additional training by utilizing a transformer structure to accommodate variable input sizes and incorporating a novel "X-fusion" mechanism to preserve modality-specific features during multimodal integration. This approach not only enhances adaptability but also facilitates the learning of complementary features across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets, employing six distinct modalities, demonstrate that X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation (HPE) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. The findings indicate that our proposed model can efficiently support a wide range of human sensing applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution of scalable, multimodal sensing technologies.</p></details> |  |

While significant advancements have been made in pose estimation for humans and animals, it is still a challenge in surgical robotics due to the scarcity of published data. The relatively large absolute error of the da Vinci end effector kinematics and arduous calibration procedure make calibrated kinematics data collection expensive. Driven by this limitation, we collected a dataset, dubbed SurgPose, providing instance-aware semantic keypoints and skeletons for visual surgical tool pose estimation and tracking. By marking keypoints using ultraviolet (UV) reactive paint, which is invisible under white light and fluorescent under UV light, we execute the same trajectory under different lighting conditions to collect raw videos and keypoint annotations, respectively. The SurgPose dataset consists of approximately 120k surgical instrument instances (80k for training and 40k for validation) of 6 categories. Each instrument instance is labeled with 7 semantic keypoints. Since the videos are collected in stereo pairs, the 2D pose can be lifted to 3D based on stereo-matching depth. In addition to releasing the dataset, we test a few baseline approaches to surgical instrument tracking to demonstrate the utility of SurgPose.

In this work, we re-evaluate the necessity of additional modules and analyze how to improve training efficiency and reduce redundant steps in the inference process. Based on these insights, we propose CatVTON, a simple and efficient virtual try-on diffusion model that transfers in-shop or worn garments of arbitrary categories to target individuals by concatenating them along spatial dimensions as inputs of the diffusion model. The efficiency of CatVTON is reflected in three aspects: (1) Lightweight network. CatVTON consists only of a VAE and a simplified denoising UNet, removing redundant image and text encoders as well as cross-attentions, and includes just 899.06M parameters. (2) Parameter-efficient training. Through experimental analysis, we identify self-attention modules as crucial for adapting pre-trained diffusion models to the virtual try-on task, enabling high-quality results with only 49.57M training parameters. (3) Simplified inference. CatVTON eliminates unnecessary preprocessing, such as pose estimation, human parsing, and captioning, requiring only a person image and garment reference to guide the virtual try-on process, reducing over 49% memory usage compared to other diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CatVTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results compared to baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalization performance in in-the-wild scenarios, despite being trained solely on public datasets with 73K samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

For the task of test-time adaptation, the misalignment manifests as overly smoothed and unguided predictions. The smoothing settles predictions towards some average pose. Furthermore, when there are occlusions or truncations, the adaptation becomes fully unguided. To this end, we pioneer the integration of a semantics-aware motion prior for the test-time adaptation of 3D pose estimation. We leverage video understanding and a well-structured motion-text space to adapt the model motion prediction to adhere to video semantics during test time. Additionally, we incorporate a missing 2D pose completion based on the motion-text similarity. The pose completion strengthens the motion prior's guidance for occlusions and truncations. Our method significantly improves state-of-the-art 3D human pose estimation TTA techniques, with more than 12% decrease in PA-MPJPE on 3DPW and 3DHP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Most state-of-the-art methods adopt optical flow or temporal difference, learning local visual content correspondence across frames at the pixel level, to capture motion dynamics. However, such a paradigm essentially relies on localized pixel-to-pixel similarity, which neglects the semantical correlations among frames and is vulnerable to image quality degradations (e.g. occlusions or blur). Moreover, existing approaches often combine motion and spatial (appearance) features via simple concatenation or summation, leading to practical challenges in fully leveraging these distinct modalities. In this paper, we present a novel framework that learns multi-level semantical dynamics and dense spatio-temporal collaboration for multi-frame human pose estimation. Specifically, we first design a Multi-Level Semantic Motion Encoder using a multi-masked context and pose reconstruction strategy. This strategy stimulates the model to explore multi-granularity spatiotemporal semantic relationships among frames by progressively masking the features of (patch) cubes and frames. We further introduce a Spatial-Motion Mutual Learning module which densely propagates and consolidates context information from spatial and motion features to enhance the capability of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets new state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, PoseTrack2017, PoseTrack2018, and PoseTrack21.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metamorphic Testing for Pose Estimation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09460v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose estimation systems are used in a variety of fields, from sports analytics to livestock care. Given their potential impact, it is paramount to systematically test their behaviour and potential for failure. This is a complex task due to the oracle problem and the high cost of manual labelling necessary to build ground truth keypoints. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that different applications require systems to focus on different subjects (e.g., human versus animal) or landmarks (e.g., only extremities versus whole body and face), which makes labelled test data rarely reusable. To combat these problems we propose MET-POSE, a metamorphic testing framework for pose estimation systems that bypasses the need for manual annotation while assessing the performance of these systems under different circumstances. MET-POSE thus allows users of pose estimation systems to assess the systems in conditions that more closely relate to their application without having to label an ad-hoc test dataset or rely only on available datasets, which may not be adapted to their application domain. While we define MET-POSE in general terms, we also present a non-exhaustive list of metamorphic rules that represent common challenges in computer vision applications, as well as a specific way to evaluate these rules. We then experimentally show the effectiveness of MET-POSE by applying it to Mediapipe Holistic, a state of the art human pose estimation system, with the FLIC and PHOENIX datasets. With these experiments, we outline numerous ways in which the outputs of MET-POSE can uncover faults in pose estimation systems at a similar or higher rate than classic testing using hand labelled data, and show that users can tailor the rule set they use to the faults and level of accuracy relevant to their application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 2025 IEEE Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST)</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Semi-Supervised 2D Human Pose Estimation by Revisiting Data Augmentation and Consistency Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11566v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 2D human pose estimation (HPE) is a basic visual problem. However, its supervised learning requires massive keypoint labels, which is labor-intensive to collect. Thus, we aim at boosting a pose estimator by excavating extra unlabeled data with semi-supervised learning (SSL). Most previous SSHPE methods are consistency-based and strive to maintain consistent outputs for differently augmented inputs. Under this genre, we find that SSHPE can be boosted from two cores: advanced data augmentations and concise consistency training ways. Specifically, for the first core, we discover the synergistic effects of existing augmentations, and reveal novel paradigms for conveniently producing new superior HPE-oriented augmentations which can more effectively add noise on unlabeled samples. We can therefore establish paired easy-hard augmentations with larger difficulty gaps. For the second core, we propose to repeatedly augment unlabeled images with diverse hard augmentations, and generate multi-path predictions sequentially for optimizing multi-losses in a single network. This simple and compact design is interpretable, and easily benefits from newly found augmentations. Comparing to state-of-the-art SSL approaches, our method brings substantial improvements on public datasets. And we extensively validate the superiority and versatility of our approach on conventional human body images, overhead fisheye images, and human hand images.

By observing a user's arm movements, robots can respond appropriately, whether it's providing assistance or avoiding collisions. While visual perception offers potential for human pose estimation, it can be hindered by factors like poor lighting or occlusions. Additionally, wearable inertial sensors, though useful, require frequent calibration as they do not provide absolute position information. Force-myography (FMG) is an alternative approach where muscle perturbations are externally measured. It has been used to observe finger movements, but its application to full arm state estimation is unexplored. In this letter, we investigate the use of a wearable FMG device that can observe the state of the human arm for real-time applications of HRI. We propose a Transformer-based model to map FMG measurements from the shoulder of the user to the physical pose of the arm. The model is also shown to be transferable to other users with limited decline in accuracy. Through real-world experiments with a robotic arm, we demonstrate collision avoidance without relying on visual perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Physical Plausibility of 3D Human Poses Using Physics Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04483v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling humans in physical scenes is vital for understanding human-environment interactions for applications involving augmented reality or assessment of human actions from video (e.g. sports or physical rehabilitation). State-of-the-art literature begins with a 3D human pose, from monocular or multiple views, and uses this representation to ground the person within a 3D world space. While standard metrics for accuracy capture joint position errors, they do not consider physical plausibility of the 3D pose. This limitation has motivated researchers to propose other metrics evaluating jitter, floor penetration, and unbalanced postures. Yet, these approaches measure independent instances of errors and are not representative of balance or stability during motion. In this work, we propose measuring physical plausibility from within physics simulation. We introduce two metrics to capture the physical plausibility and stability of predicted 3D poses from any 3D Human Pose Estimation model. Using physics simulation, we discover correlations with existing plausibility metrics and measuring stability during motion. We evaluate and compare the performances of two state-of-the-art methods, a multi-view triangulated baseline, and ground truth 3D markers from the Human3.6m dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to BMVC2024 |

Although powerful deep learning models have achieved accurate estimation in this task, they require enormous memory and computational resources. Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed on resource-limited edge devices. In this work, we propose BinaryHPE, a novel binarization method designed to estimate the 3D human body, face, and hands parameters efficiently. Specifically, we propose a novel binary backbone called Binarized Dual Residual Network (BiDRN), designed to retain as much full-precision information as possible. Furthermore, we propose the Binarized BoxNet, an efficient sub-network for predicting face and hands bounding boxes, which further reduces model redundancy. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BinaryHPE, which has a significant improvement over state-of-the-art binarization algorithms. Moreover, our BinaryHPE achieves comparable performance with the full-precision method Hand4Whole while using only 22.1% parameters and 14.8% operations.

Specifically, our CSVR consists of three branches: a generative pose prediction branch, a discriminative context matching branch, and a video generating branch. Among them, the first one encodes dynamic motion feature by utilizing Conditional-GAN to predict the human poses of future frames, and the second branch extracts static context features by contrasting positive and negative video feature and I-frame feature pairs. The third branch is designed to generate both current and future video frames, for the purpose of collaboratively improving dynamic motion features and static context features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple popular video datasets.</p></details> |  |

While HAR has been extensively studied, action summarization, which involves identifying and summarizing continuous actions, remains an emerging task. This paper introduces the novel XRF V2 dataset, designed for indoor daily activity Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and action summarization. XRF V2 integrates multimodal data from Wi-Fi signals, IMU sensors (smartphones, smartwatches, headphones, and smart glasses), and synchronized video recordings, offering a diverse collection of indoor activities from 16 volunteers across three distinct environments. To tackle TAL and action summarization, we propose the XRFMamba neural network, which excels at capturing long-term dependencies in untrimmed sensory sequences and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as ActionFormer and WiFiTAD. We envision XRF V2 as a valuable resource for advancing research in human action localization, action forecasting, pose estimation, multimodal foundation models pre-training, synthetic data generation, and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Toward Efficient Generalization in 3D Human Pose Estimation via a Canonical Domain Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16146v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning methods have significantly improved the performance of 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE). However, performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source and target domains remains a major challenge to generalization, necessitating extensive data augmentation and/or fine-tuning for each specific target domain. To address this issue more efficiently, we propose a novel canonical domain approach that maps both the source and target domains into a unified canonical domain, alleviating the need for additional fine-tuning in the target domain. To construct the canonical domain, we introduce a canonicalization process to generate a novel canonical 2D-3D pose mapping that ensures 2D-3D pose consistency and simplifies 2D-3D pose patterns, enabling more efficient training of lifting networks. The canonicalization of both domains is achieved through the following steps: (1) in the source domain, the lifting network is trained within the canonical domain; (2) in the target domain, input 2D poses are canonicalized prior to inference by leveraging the properties of perspective projection and known camera intrinsics. Consequently, the trained network can be directly applied to the target domain without requiring additional fine-tuning. Experiments conducted with various lifting networks and publicly available datasets (e.g., Human3.6M, Fit3D, MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves generalization capability across datasets while using the same data volume.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[NanoHTNet: Nano Human Topology Network for Efficient 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15763v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is limited by resource-constrained edge devices, requiring more efficient models. A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano.

| **[SpatioTemporal Learning for Human Pose Estimation in Sparsely-Labeled Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15073v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation in videos remains a challenge, largely due to the reliance on extensive manual annotation of large datasets, which is expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore, existing approaches often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and overlook the complementary relationship between temporal pose heatmaps and visual features. To address these limitations, we introduce STDPose, a novel framework that enhances human pose estimation by learning spatiotemporal dynamics in sparsely-labeled videos. STDPose incorporates two key innovations: 1) A novel Dynamic-Aware Mask to capture long-range motion context, allowing for a nuanced understanding of pose changes. 2) A system for encoding and aggregating spatiotemporal representations and motion dynamics to effectively model spatiotemporal relationships, improving the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. STDPose establishes a new performance benchmark for both video pose propagation (i.e., propagating pose annotations from labeled frames to unlabeled frames) and pose estimation tasks, across three large-scale evaluation datasets. Additionally, utilizing pseudo-labels generated by pose propagation, STDPose achieves competitive performance with only 26.7% labeled data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Human Pose Estimation Through Focused Human and Joint Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14439v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has given rise to a broad spectrum of novel and compelling applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, as well as surveillance. However, accurate video pose estimation remains an open challenge. One aspect that has been overlooked so far is that existing methods learn motion clues from all pixels rather than focusing on the target human body, making them easily misled and disrupted by unimportant information such as background changes or movements of other people. Additionally, while the current Transformer-based pose estimation methods has demonstrated impressive performance with global modeling, they struggle with local context perception and precise positional identification. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) We propose a bilayer Human-Keypoint Mask module that performs coarse-to-fine visual token refinement, which gradually zooms in on the target human body and keypoints while masking out unimportant figure regions. (2) We further introduce a novel deformable cross attention mechanism and a bidirectional separation strategy to adaptively aggregate spatial and temporal motion clues from constrained surrounding contexts. (3) We mathematically formulate the deformable cross attention, constraining that the model focuses solely on the regions centered at the target person body. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale benchmark datasets. A remarkable highlight is that our method achieves an 84.8 mean Average Precision (mAP) on the challenging wrist joint, which significantly outperforms the 81.5 mAP achieved by the current state-of-the-art method on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal-Inspired Multitask Learning for Video-Based Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14356v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based human pose estimation has long been a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer vision. Previous studies focus on spatio-temporal modeling through the enhancement of architecture design and optimization strategies. However, they overlook the causal relationships in the joints, leading to models that may be overly tailored and thus estimate poorly to challenging scenes. Therefore, adequate causal reasoning capability, coupled with good interpretability of model, are both indispensable and prerequisite for achieving reliable results. In this paper, we pioneer a causal perspective on pose estimation and introduce a causal-inspired multitask learning framework, consisting of two stages. \textit{In the first stage}, we try to endow the model with causal spatio-temporal modeling ability by introducing two self-supervision auxiliary tasks. Specifically, these auxiliary tasks enable the network to infer challenging keypoints based on observed keypoint information, thereby imbuing causal reasoning capabilities into the model and making it robust to challenging scenes. \textit{In the second stage}, we argue that not all feature tokens contribute equally to pose estimation. Prioritizing causal (keypoint-relevant) tokens is crucial to achieve reliable results, which could improve the interpretability of the model. To this end, we propose a Token Causal Importance Selection module to identify the causal tokens and non-causal tokens (\textit{e.g.}, background and objects). Additionally, non-causal tokens could provide potentially beneficial cues but may be redundant. We further introduce a non-causal tokens clustering module to merge the similar non-causal tokens. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

To address this we introduce BlanketGen2-Fit3D (BG2-Fit3D), an augmentation of Fit3D dataset that contains 1,217,312 frames with synthetic photo-realistic blankets. To generate it we used BlanketGen2, our new and improved version of our BlanketGen pipeline that simulates synthetic blankets using ground-truth Skinned Multi-Person Linear model (SMPL) meshes and then renders them as transparent images that can be layered on top of the original frames. This dataset was used in combination with the original Fit3D to finetune the ViTPose-B HPE model, to evaluate synthetic blanket augmentation effectiveness. The trained models were further evaluated on a real-world blanket occluded in-bed HPE dataset (SLP dataset). Comparing architectures trained on only Fit3D with the ones trained with our synthetic blanket augmentation the later improved pose estimation performance on BG2-Fit3D, the synthetic blanket occluded dataset significantly to (0.977 Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), 0.149 Normalized Mean Error (NME)) with an absolute 4.4% PCK increase. Furthermore, the test results on SLP demonstrated the utility of synthetic data augmentation by improving performance by an absolute 2.3% PCK, on real-world images with the poses occluded by real blankets. These results show synthetic blanket augmentation has the potential to improve in-bed blanket occluded HPE from RGB images. The dataset as well as the code will be made available to the public.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Towards Robust and Realistic Human Pose Estimation via WiFi Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09411v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust WiFi-based human pose estimation is a challenging task that bridges discrete and subtle WiFi signals to human skeletons. This paper revisits this problem and reveals two critical yet overlooked issues: 1) cross-domain gap, i.e., due to significant variations between source-target domain pose distributions; and 2) structural fidelity gap, i.e., predicted skeletal poses manifest distorted topology, usually with misplaced joints and disproportionate bone lengths. This paper fills these gaps by reformulating the task into a novel two-phase framework dubbed DT-Pose: Domain-consistent representation learning and Topology-constrained Pose decoding. Concretely, we first propose a temporal-consistent contrastive learning strategy with uniformity regularization, coupled with self-supervised masking-reconstruction operations, to enable robust learning of domain-consistent and motion-discriminative WiFi-specific representations. Beyond this, we introduce a simple yet effective pose decoder with task prompts, which integrates Graph Convolution Network (GCN) and Transformer layers to constrain the topology structure of the generated skeleton by exploring the adjacent-overarching relationships among human joints. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of our method in tackling these fundamental challenges in both 2D/3D human pose estimation tasks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

While previous datasets have primarily focused on local poses, often limited to a single person or in constrained, indoor settings, the infrastructure deployed for this sporting event allows access to multiple fixed and moving cameras in different stadiums. We exploit the static multi-view setup of HD cameras to recover the 3D player poses and motions with unprecedented accuracy given capture areas of more than 1.75 acres. We then leverage the captured players' motions and field markings to calibrate a moving broadcasting camera. The resulting dataset comprises more than 80 sequences with approx 2.5 million 3D poses and a total traveling distance of over 120 km. Subsequently, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the SOTA methods for global pose estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that WorldPose challenges existing multi-person techniques, supporting the potential for new research in this area and others, such as sports analysis. All pose annotations (in SMPL format), broadcasting camera parameters and footage will be released for academic research purposes.</p></details> |  |

Despite encouraging progress, current state-of-the-art methods focus on training innovative architectural designs on confined datasets. In this work, we investigate the impact of scaling up EHPS towards a family of generalist foundation models. 1) For data scaling, we perform a systematic investigation on 40 EHPS datasets, encompassing a wide range of scenarios that a model trained on any single dataset cannot handle. More importantly, capitalizing on insights obtained from the extensive benchmarking process, we optimize our training scheme and select datasets that lead to a significant leap in EHPS capabilities. Ultimately, we achieve diminishing returns at 10M training instances from diverse data sources. 2) For model scaling, we take advantage of vision transformers (up to ViT-Huge as the backbone) to study the scaling law of model sizes in EHPS. To exclude the influence of algorithmic design, we base our experiments on two minimalist architectures: SMPLer-X, which consists of an intermediate step for hand and face localization, and SMPLest-X, an even simpler version that reduces the network to its bare essentials and highlights significant advances in the capture of articulated hands. With big data and the large model, the foundation models exhibit strong performance across diverse test benchmarks and excellent transferability to even unseen environments. Moreover, our finetuning strategy turns the generalist into specialist models, allowing them to achieve further performance boosts. Notably, our foundation models consistently deliver state-of-the-art results on seven benchmarks such as AGORA, UBody, EgoBody, and our proposed SynHand dataset for comprehensive hand evaluation.

Yet the prevailing data collection paradigm-human teleoperation-remains costly and constrained by manual effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision modeling off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human teleoperation demonstrations.

Neural video codecs (NVC) create an end-to-end ML-based solution that does not rely on any handcrafted features (motion or edge-based) and have the ability to learn content-aware compression strategies, offering better adaptability and higher compression efficiency than traditional methods. This holds a great potential not only for hardware design, but also for various video streaming platforms and applications, especially video conferencing applications such as MS-Teams or Zoom that have found extensive usage in classrooms and workplaces. However, their high computational demands currently limit their use in real-time applications like video conferencing. To address this, we propose a region-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model that leverages 2D Gaussian Splatting. Unlike traditional codecs, 2D Gaussian Splatting is capable of real-time decoding and can be optimized using fewer data points, requiring only thousands of Gaussians for decent quality outputs as opposed to millions in 3D scenes. In this work, we designed a video pipeline that speeds up the encoding time of the previous Gaussian splatting-based image codec by 88% by using a content-aware initialization strategy paired with a novel Gaussian inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, enabling Gaussian splatting to be used for a video-codec solution, the first of its kind solution in this neural video codec space.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved breakthrough progress in 3D scene reconstruction and rendering, attracting widespread attention and opening new pathways for 3D garment reconstruction.

In this paper, we present GarmentGS, a dense point cloud-guided method that can reconstruct high-fidelity garment surfaces with high geometric accuracy and generate non-watertight, single-layer meshes. Our method introduces a fast dense point cloud reconstruction module that can complete garment point cloud reconstruction in 10 minutes, compared to traditional methods that require several hours. Furthermore, we use dense point clouds to guide the movement, flattening, and rotation of Gaussian primitives, enabling better distribution on the garment surface to achieve superior rendering effects and geometric accuracy. Through numerical and visual comparisons, our method achieves fast training and real-time rendering while maintaining competitive quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMR 2025</p></details> |

Most previous methods rely on precise localization and mapping or learn from expensive real-world demonstrations. In this paper, we propose the Navigation Diffusion Policy (NavDP), an end-to-end framework trained solely in simulation and can zero-shot transfer to different embodiments in diverse real-world environments. The key ingredient of NavDP's network is the combination of diffusion-based trajectory generation and a critic function for trajectory selection, which are conditioned on only local observation tokens encoded from a shared policy transformer. Given the privileged information of the global environment in simulation, we scale up the demonstrations of good quality to train the diffusion policy and formulate the critic value function targets with contrastive negative samples. Our demonstration generation approach achieves about 2,500 trajectories/GPU per day, 20$\times$ more efficient than real-world data collection, and results in a large-scale navigation dataset with 363.2km trajectories across 1244 scenes. Trained with this simulation dataset, NavDP achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outstanding generalization capability on quadruped, wheeled, and humanoid robots in diverse indoor and outdoor environments. In addition, we present a preliminary attempt at using Gaussian Splatting to make in-domain real-to-sim fine-tuning to further bridge the sim-to-real gap. Experiments show that adding such real-to-sim data can improve the success rate by 30\% without hurting its generalization capability.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, its reliance on sparse Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point clouds often limits scene reconstruction quality. To address the limitation, this paper proposes a novel 3D reconstruction framework, Gaussian Processes enhanced Gaussian Splatting (GP-GS), in which a multi-output Gaussian Process model is developed to enable adaptive and uncertainty-guided densification of sparse SfM point clouds. Specifically, we propose a dynamic sampling and filtering pipeline that adaptively expands the SfM point clouds by leveraging GP-based predictions to infer new candidate points from the input 2D pixels and depth maps. The pipeline utilizes uncertainty estimates to guide the pruning of high-variance predictions, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling the generation of dense point clouds. These densified point clouds provide high-quality initial 3D Gaussians, enhancing reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets across various scales validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

With depth map generation, spatial information for every pixel within the TDOM is retrieved and can reconstruct the scene with high precision. Divide-and-conquer strategy achieves excellent GS training and rendering with high-resolution TDOMs at a lower resource cost, which preserves higher quality of rendering on complex terrain and thin structure without a decrease in efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of large-scale scene reconstruction and high-precision terrain modeling. This approach provides accurate spatial data, which assists users in better planning and decision-making based on maps.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

Creating UDTs involves challenges at multiple process stages, including acquiring accurate 3D source data, reconstructing high-fidelity 3D models, maintaining models' updates, and ensuring seamless interoperability to downstream tasks. Current datasets are usually limited to one part of the processing chain, hampering comprehensive UDTs validation. To address these challenges, we introduce the first comprehensive multimodal Urban Digital Twin benchmark dataset: TUM2TWIN. This dataset includes georeferenced, semantically aligned 3D models and networks along with various terrestrial, mobile, aerial, and satellite observations boasting 32 data subsets over roughly 100,000 $m^2$ and currently 767 GB of data. By ensuring georeferenced indoor-outdoor acquisition, high accuracy, and multimodal data integration, the benchmark supports robust analysis of sensors and the development of advanced reconstruction methods. Additionally, we explore downstream tasks demonstrating the potential of TUM2TWIN, including novel view synthesis of NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, solar potential analysis, point cloud semantic segmentation, and LoD3 building reconstruction. We are convinced this contribution lays a foundation for overcoming current limitations in UDT creation, fostering new research directions and practical solutions for smarter, data-driven urban environments.

Unlike conventional frame-based cameras, they produce sparse and temporally rich data streams, which enable more accurate 3D reconstruction and open up the possibility of performing reconstruction in extreme environments such as high-speed motion, low light, or high dynamic range scenes. In this survey, we provide the first comprehensive review focused exclusively on 3D reconstruction using event cameras. The survey categorises existing works into three major types based on input modality - stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems, and further classifies them by reconstruction approach, including geometry-based, deep learning-based, and recent neural rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Methods with a similar research focus were organised chronologically into the most subdivided groups. We also summarise public datasets relevant to event-based 3D reconstruction. Finally, we highlight current research limitations in data availability, evaluation, representation, and dynamic scene handling, and outline promising future research directions.

Nonetheless, existing diffusion models predominantly concentrate on modeling static 3D scenes or object-level dynamics, constraining their capacity to provide truly immersive experiences. To address this issue, we propose HoloTime, a framework that integrates video diffusion models to generate panoramic videos from a single prompt or reference image, along with a 360-degree 4D scene reconstruction method that seamlessly transforms the generated panoramic video into 4D assets, enabling a fully immersive 4D experience for users. Specifically, to tame video diffusion models for generating high-fidelity panoramic videos, we introduce the 360World dataset, the first comprehensive collection of panoramic videos suitable for downstream 4D scene reconstruction tasks. With this curated dataset, we propose Panoramic Animator, a two-stage image-to-video diffusion model that can convert panoramic images into high-quality panoramic videos. Following this, we present Panoramic Space-Time Reconstruction, which leverages a space-time depth estimation method to transform the generated panoramic videos into 4D point clouds, enabling the optimization of a holistic 4D Gaussian Splatting representation to reconstruct spatially and temporally consistent 4D scenes. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conducted a comparative analysis with existing approaches, revealing its superiority in both panoramic video generation and 4D scene reconstruction. This demonstrates our method's capability to create more engaging and realistic immersive environments, thereby enhancing user experiences in VR and AR applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Homepage: https://zhouhyocean.github.io/holotime/ Code: https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/HoloTime</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose Anchor-Driven Deformable and Compressed Gaussian Splatting (ADC-GS), a compact and efficient representation for dynamic scene reconstruction. Specifically, ADC-GS organizes Gaussian primitives into an anchor-based structure within the canonical space, enhanced by a temporal significance-based anchor refinement strategy. To reduce deformation redundancy, ADC-GS introduces a hierarchical coarse-to-fine pipeline that captures motions at varying granularities. Moreover, a rate-distortion optimization is adopted to achieve an optimal balance between bitrate consumption and representation fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that ADC-GS outperforms the per-Gaussian deformation approaches in rendering speed by 300%-800% while achieving state-of-the-art storage efficiency without compromising rendering quality.

Many of these scenarios are time-sensitive, requiring rapid scene encoding while also being data-intensive, necessitating scalable solutions. Deploying these representations on robots with limited computational resources further adds to the challenge. To address this, we introduce SLAG, a multi-GPU framework for language-augmented Gaussian splatting that enhances the speed and scalability of embedding large scenes. Our method integrates 2D visual-language model features into 3D scenes using SAM and CLIP. Unlike prior approaches, SLAG eliminates the need for a loss function to compute per-Gaussian language embeddings. Instead, it derives embeddings from 3D Gaussian scene parameters via a normalized weighted average, enabling highly parallelized scene encoding. Additionally, we introduce a vector database for efficient embedding storage and retrieval. Our experiments show that SLAG achieves an 18 times speedup in embedding computation on a 16-GPU setup compared to OpenGaussian, while preserving embedding quality on the ScanNet and LERF datasets.

However, existing methods primarily rely on implicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks or per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the reconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application in robotics. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MBGS), a novel framework that uses motion graphs as an explicit and sparse motion representation. The motion of a graph's links is propagated to individual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions that determine the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that MBGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the highly challenging iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF. We demonstrate the application potential of our method in animating novel object poses, synthesizing real robot demonstrations, and predicting robot actions through visual planning.

However, it falls short when dealing with glossy surfaces, resulting in visible holes in these areas. We found the reflection discontinuity causes the issue. To fit the jump from diffuse to specular reflection at different viewing angles, depth bias is introduced in the optimized Gaussian primitives. To address that, we first replace the depth distortion loss in 2DGS with a novel depth convergence loss, which imposes a strong constraint on depth continuity. Then, we rectified the depth criterion in determining the actual surface, which fully accounts for all the intersecting Gaussians along the ray. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations across various datasets reveal that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality, with more complete and accurate surfaces than 2DGS.</p></details> | <details><summary>We fo...</summary><p>We found a major error in Sec. 4.3 Novel View Synthesis.

Recently, 4D Gaussian Splatting has gained attention as an effective approach for immersive video due to its high rendering efficiency and quality, though maintaining quality with manageable storage remains challenging. To address this, we introduce GIFStream, a novel 4D Gaussian representation using a canonical space and a deformation field enhanced with time-dependent feature streams. These feature streams enable complex motion modeling and allow efficient compression by leveraging temporal correspondence and motion-aware pruning. Additionally, we incorporate both temporal and spatial compression networks for end-to-end compression.

However, the task is significantly challenged by the complex interplay between light propagation, water medium, and object surfaces, with existing methods unable to model their interactions accurately. Additionally, expensive training and rendering costs limit their practical application in underwater robotic systems. Therefore, we propose Tensorized Underwater Gaussian Splatting (TUGS), which can effectively solve the modeling challenges of the complex interactions between object geometries and water media while achieving significant parameter reduction. TUGS employs lightweight tensorized higher-order Gaussians with a physics-based underwater Adaptive Medium Estimation (AME) module, enabling accurate simulation of both light attenuation and backscatter effects in underwater environments. Compared to other NeRF-based and GS-based methods designed for underwater, TUGS is able to render high-quality underwater images with faster rendering speeds and less memory usage. Extensive experiments on real-world underwater datasets have demonstrated that TUGS can efficiently achieve superior reconstruction quality using a limited number of parameters, making it particularly suitable for memory-constrained underwater UAV applications</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we derive a closed-form solution for a 2D Gaussian-to-hologram transform that supports occlusions and alpha blending. Inspired by classic computer graphics techniques, we also derive an efficient approximation of the aforementioned process in the Fourier domain that is easily parallelizable and implement it using custom CUDA kernels. By integrating emerging neural rendering pipelines with holographic display technology, our Gaussian-based CGH framework paves the way for next-generation holographic displays.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page with more details: https://bchao1.github.io/gaussian-wave-splatting/</p></details> |

Its explicit and discrete representation facilitates the seamless composition of complex digital worlds, offering significant advantages over previous neural implicit methods. However, when applied to large-scale compositions, such as crowd-level scenes, it can encompass numerous 3D Gaussians, posing substantial challenges for real-time rendering. To address this, inspired by Unreal Engine 5's Nanite system, we propose Virtualized 3D Gaussians (V3DG), a cluster-based LOD solution that constructs hierarchical 3D Gaussian clusters and dynamically selects only the necessary ones to accelerate rendering speed. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Offline Build, where hierarchical clusters are generated using a local splatting method to minimize visual differences across granularities, and (2) Online Selection, where footprint evaluation determines perceptible clusters for efficient rasterization during rendering. We curate a dataset of synthetic and real-world scenes, including objects, trees, people, and buildings, each requiring 0.1 billion 3D Gaussians to capture fine details. Experiments show that our solution balances rendering efficiency and visual quality across user-defined tolerances, facilitating downstream interactive applications that compose extensive 3DGS assets for consistent rendering performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://xijie-yang.github.io/V3DG/</p></details> |

Today, such photoreal avatars are seen as a key component in emerging applications in telepresence, extended reality, and entertainment. Building a photoreal avatar requires estimating the complex non-rigid motion of different facial components as seen in input video images; due to inaccurate motion estimation, animatable models typically present a loss of fidelity and detail when compared to their non-animatable counterparts, built from an individual facial expression. Also, recent state-of-the-art models are often affected by memory limitations that reduce the number of 3D Gaussians used for modeling, leading to lower detail and quality. To address these problems, we present a new high-detail 3D head avatar model that improves upon the state of the art, largely increasing the number of 3D Gaussians and modeling quality for rendering at 4K resolution. Our high-quality model is reconstructed from multiview input video and builds on top of a mesh-based 3D morphable model, which provides a coarse deformation layer for the head. Photoreal appearance is modelled by 3D Gaussians embedded within the continuous UVD tangent space of this mesh, allowing for more effective densification where most needed. Additionally, these Gaussians are warped by a novel UVD deformation field to capture subtle, localized motion. Our key contribution is the novel deformable Gaussian encoding and overall fitting procedure that allows our head model to preserve appearance detail, while capturing facial motion and other transient high-frequency features such as skin wrinkling.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, supplementary results found at: https://syntec-research.github.io/UVGA/, to be published in SIGGRAPH 2025</p></details> |

We introduce UltraGauss: the first ultrasound-specific Gaussian Splatting framework, extending view synthesis techniques to ultrasound wave propagation. Unlike conventional perspective-based splatting, UltraGauss models probe-plane intersections in 3D, aligning with acoustic image formation. We derive an efficient rasterization boundary formulation for GPU parallelization and introduce a numerically stable covariance parametrization, improving computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. On real clinical ultrasound data, UltraGauss achieves state-of-the-art reconstructions in 5 minutes, and reaching 0.99 SSIM within 20 minutes on a single GPU. A survey of expert clinicians confirms UltraGauss' reconstructions are the most realistic among competing methods. Our CUDA implementation will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |

We introduce QuickSplat, which learns data-driven priors to generate dense initializations for 2D gaussian splatting optimization of large-scale indoor scenes. This provides a strong starting point for the reconstruction, which accelerates the convergence of the optimization and improves the geometry of flat wall structures. We further learn to jointly estimate the densification and update of the scene parameters during each iteration; our proposed densifier network predicts new Gaussians based on the rendering gradients of existing ones, removing the needs of heuristics for densification. Extensive experiments on large-scale indoor scene reconstruction demonstrate the superiority of our data-driven optimization.

By representing scenes as a mixture of Gaussian primitives, 3DGS leverages GPU rasterization pipelines for efficient rendering and reconstruction. To optimize scene coverage and capture fine details, 3DGS employs a densification algorithm to generate additional points. However, this process often leads to redundant point clouds, resulting in excessive memory usage, slower performance, and substantial storage demands - posing significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that demystifies and improves density control in 3DGS. Our analysis reveals that splitting is crucial for escaping saddle points. Through an optimization-theoretic approach, we establish the necessary conditions for densification, determine the minimal number of offspring Gaussians, identify the optimal parameter update direction, and provide an analytical solution for normalizing off-spring opacity. Building on these insights, we introduce SteepGS, incorporating steepest density control, a principled strategy that minimizes loss while maintaining a compact point cloud. SteepGS achieves a ~50% reduction in Gaussian points without compromising rendering quality, significantly enhancing both efficiency and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project page: https://vita-group.github.io/SteepGS/</p></details> |

Current approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences, while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars.

Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians.

However, training a 3DGS model remains a time-intensive task, especially in load imbalance scenarios where workload diversity among pixels and Gaussian spheres causes poor renderCUDA kernel performance. We introduce Balanced 3DGS, a Gaussian-wise parallelism rendering with fine-grained tiling approach in 3DGS training process, perfectly solving load-imbalance issues. First, we innovatively introduce the inter-block dynamic workload distribution technique to map workloads to Streaming Multiprocessor(SM) resources within a single GPU dynamically, which constitutes the foundation of load balancing. Second, we are the first to propose the Gaussian-wise parallel rendering technique to significantly reduce workload divergence inside a warp, which serves as a critical component in addressing load imbalance. Based on the above two methods, we further creatively put forward the fine-grained combined load balancing technique to uniformly distribute workload across all SMs, which boosts the forward renderCUDA kernel performance by up to 7.52x. Besides, we present a self-adaptive render kernel selection strategy during the 3DGS training process based on different load-balance situations, which effectively improves training efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, by reformulating the optimization as a multi-view joint optimization problem, we derive an effective optimization rule that effectively couples multi-view priors to guide optimization across different viewpoints while preserving the diversity of generated 3D assets. Additionally, we propose a framework that directly optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) with random initialization to generate geometrically consistent 3D content.

The latest 3D Gaussian Splatting technique has achieved high quality novel view synthesis as well as fast rendering speed. However, 3D Gaussians lack proficiency in defining accurate 3D geometric structures despite their explicit primitive representations. This is due to the fact that Gaussian's attributes are primarily tailored and fine-tuned for rendering diverse 2D images by their anisotropic nature. To pave the way for efficient 3D reconstruction, we present Spherical Gaussians, a simple and effective representation for 3D geometric boundaries, from which we can directly reconstruct 3D feature curves from a set of calibrated multi-view images. Spherical Gaussians is optimized from grid initialization with a view-based rendering loss, where a 2D edge map is rendered at a specific view and then compared to the ground-truth edge map extracted from the corresponding image, without the need for any 3D guidance or supervision. Given Spherical Gaussians serve as intermedia for the robust edge representation, we further introduce a novel optimization-based algorithm called SGCR to directly extract accurate parametric curves from aligned Spherical Gaussians. We demonstrate that SGCR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in 3D edge reconstruction while enjoying great efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025, 8 pages</p></details> |

Our approach addresses two critical challenges: (1) precise 3D object extraction from the source scene, and (2) faithful relighting of the transferred object in the target scene without explicit material property estimation. TranSplat fits a splatting model to the source scene, using 2D object masks to drive fine-grained 3D segmentation. Following user-guided insertion of the object into the target scene, along with automatic refinement of position and orientation, TranSplat derives per-Gaussian radiance transfer functions via spherical harmonic analysis to adapt the object's appearance to match the target scene's lighting environment. This relighting strategy does not require explicitly estimating physical scene properties such as BRDFs. Evaluated on several synthetic and real-world scenes and objects, TranSplat yields excellent 3D object extractions and relighting performance compared to recent baseline methods and visually convincing cross-scene object transfers. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the approach.</p></details> |  |

Current methods are capable of rendering novel-view images and semantic maps by reconstructing generalizable Neural Radiance Fields. However, they often suffer from limitations in speed and segmentation performance. We propose a generalizable semantic Gaussian Splatting method (GSsplat) for efficient novel-view synthesis. Our model predicts the positions and attributes of scene-adaptive Gaussian distributions from once input, replacing the densification and pruning processes of traditional scene-specific Gaussian Splatting. In the multi-task framework, a hybrid network is designed to extract color and semantic information and predict Gaussian parameters. To augment the spatial perception of Gaussians for high-quality rendering, we put forward a novel offset learning module through group-based supervision and a point-level interaction module with spatial unit aggregation. When evaluated with varying numbers of multi-view inputs, GSsplat achieves state-of-the-art performance for semantic synthesis at the fastest speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Gaussian Splatting Data Compression with Mixture of Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03310v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data compression is crucial for enabling efficient storage and transmission in 3D scene modeling. However, its development remains limited due to inadequate entropy models and suboptimal quantization strategies for both lossless and lossy compression scenarios, where existing methods have yet to 1) fully leverage hyperprior information to construct robust conditional entropy models, and 2) apply fine-grained, element-wise quantization strategies for improved compression granularity. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture of Priors (MoP) strategy to simultaneously address these two challenges. Specifically, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, our MoP approach processes hyperprior information through multiple lightweight MLPs to generate diverse prior features, which are subsequently integrated into the MoP feature via a gating mechanism. To enhance lossless compression, the resulting MoP feature is utilized as a hyperprior to improve conditional entropy modeling. Meanwhile, for lossy compression, we employ the MoP feature as guidance information in an element-wise quantization procedure, leveraging a prior-guided Coarse-to-Fine Quantization (C2FQ) strategy with a predefined quantization step value. Specifically, we expand the quantization step value into a matrix and adaptively refine it from coarse to fine granularity, guided by the MoP feature, thereby obtaining a quantization step matrix that facilitates element-wise quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed 3DGS data compression framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including Mip-NeRF360, BungeeNeRF, DeepBlending, and Tank&Temples.</p></details> |  |

However, its reliance on Gaussian kernels for geometry and low-order Spherical Harmonics (SH) for color encoding limits its ability to capture complex geometries and diverse colors. We introduce Deformable Beta Splatting (DBS), a deformable and compact approach that enhances both geometry and color representation. DBS replaces Gaussian kernels with deformable Beta Kernels, which offer bounded support and adaptive frequency control to capture fine geometric details with higher fidelity while achieving better memory efficiency. In addition, we extended the Beta Kernel to color encoding, which facilitates improved representation of diffuse and specular components, yielding superior results compared to SH-based methods. Furthermore, Unlike prior densification techniques that depend on Gaussian properties, we mathematically prove that adjusting regularized opacity alone ensures distribution-preserved Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), independent of the splatting kernel type. Experimental results demonstrate that DBS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while utilizing only 45% of the parameters and rendering 1.5x faster than 3DGS-MCMC, highlighting the superior performance of DBS for real-time radiance field rendering.

However, current multi-modal scene understanding approaches have naively embedded semantic representations into 3D reconstruction methods without striking a balance between visual and language modalities, which leads to unsatisfying semantic rasterization of translucent or reflective objects, as well as over-fitting on color modality. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a solution that adequately handles the distinct visual and semantic modalities, i.e., a 3D vision-language Gaussian splatting model for scene understanding, to put emphasis on the representation learning of language modality. We propose a novel cross-modal rasterizer, using modality fusion along with a smoothed semantic indicator for enhancing semantic rasterization. We also employ a camera-view blending technique to improve semantic consistency between existing and synthesized views, thereby effectively mitigating over-fitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

Unlike existing methods (e.g., NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting), which struggle with view-dependent effects, RGS-DR utilizes a 2D Gaussian surfel representation to accurately estimate geometry and surface normals, an essential property for high-quality inverse rendering. Our approach explicitly models geometric and material properties through learnable primitives rasterized into a deferred shading pipeline, effectively reducing rendering artifacts and preserving sharp reflections. By employing a multi-level cube mipmap, RGS-DR accurately approximates environment lighting integrals, facilitating high-quality reconstruction and relighting. A residual pass with spherical-mipmap-based directional encoding further refines the appearance modeling. Experiments demonstrate that RGS-DR achieves high-quality reconstruction and rendering quality for shiny objects, often outperforming reconstruction-exclusive state-of-the-art methods incapable of relighting.</p></details> |  |

We develop a novel method to efficiently rasterize Gaussians to produce a range/azimuth image that is faithful to the acoustic image formation model of imaging sonar. In particular, we develop a novel approach to model azimuth streaking in a Gaussian splatting framework. We evaluate SonarSplat using real-world datasets of sonar images collected from an underwater robotic platform in a controlled test tank and in a real-world river environment. Compared to the state-of-the-art, SonarSplat offers improved image synthesis capabilities (+3.2 dB PSNR) and more accurate 3D reconstruction (52% lower Chamfer Distance).

While few methods address sparse radiance field learning from noisy or unposed sparse cameras, shape recovery remains relatively underexplored in this setting. Several radiance and shape learning test-time optimization methods address the sparse posed setting by learning data priors or using combinations of external monocular geometry priors. Differently, we propose an efficient and simple pipeline harnessing a single recent 3D foundation model. We leverage its various task heads, notably point maps and camera initializations to instantiate a bundle adjusting 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) model, and image correspondences to guide camera optimization midst 2DGS training. Key to our contribution is a novel formulation of splatted color variance along rays, which can be computed efficiently. Reducing this moment in training leads to more accurate shape reconstructions.

The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enabled real-time, photorealistic NVS. Following this, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) leveraged perspective accurate 2D Gaussian primitive rasterization to achieve accurate geometry representation during rendering, improving 3D scene reconstruction while maintaining real-time performance. Recent approaches have tackled the problem of sparse real-time NVS using 3DGS within a generalizable, MVS-based learning framework to regress 3D Gaussian parameters. Our work extends this line of research by addressing the challenge of generalizable sparse 3D reconstruction and NVS jointly, and manages to perform successfully at both tasks. We propose an MVS-based learning pipeline that regresses 2DGS surface element parameters in a feed-forward fashion to perform 3D shape reconstruction and NVS from sparse-view images. We further show that our generalizable pipeline can benefit from preexisting foundational multi-view deep visual features. The resulting model attains the state-of-the-art results on the DTU sparse 3D reconstruction benchmark in terms of Chamfer distance to ground-truth, as-well as state-of-the-art NVS. It also demonstrates strong generalization on the BlendedMVS and Tanks and Temples datasets. We note that our model outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in feed-forward sparse view reconstruction based on volume rendering of implicit representations, while offering an almost 2 orders of magnitude higher inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page : https://shubhendu-jena.github.io/SparSplat/</p></details> |
| **[SignSplat: Rendering Sign Language via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02108v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art approaches for conditional human body rendering via Gaussian splatting typically focus on simple body motions captured from many views. This is often in the context of dancing or walking. However, for more complex use cases, such as sign language, we care less about large body motion and more about subtle and complex motions of the hands and face. The problems of building high fidelity models are compounded by the complexity of capturing multi-view data of sign. The solution is to make better use of sequence data, ensuring that we can overcome the limited information from only a few views by exploiting temporal variability. Nevertheless, learning from sequence-level data requires extremely accurate and consistent model fitting to ensure that appearance is consistent across complex motions. We focus on how to achieve this, constraining mesh parameters to build an accurate Gaussian splatting framework from few views capable of modelling subtle human motion. We leverage regularization techniques on the Gaussian parameters to mitigate overfitting and rendering artifacts. Additionally, we propose a new adaptive control method to densify Gaussians and prune splat points on the mesh surface. To demonstrate the accuracy of our approach, we render novel sequences of sign language video, building on neural machine translation approaches to sign stitching. On benchmark datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance; and on highly articulated and complex sign language motion, we significantly outperform competing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[HybridGS: High-Efficiency Gaussian Splatting Data Compression using Dual-Channel Sparse Representation and Point Cloud Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01938v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) compression schemes focus on producing compact 3DGS representation via implicit data embedding. They have long coding times and highly customized data format, making it difficult for widespread deployment. This paper presents a new 3DGS compression framework called HybridGS, which takes advantage of both compact generation and standardized point cloud data encoding. HybridGS first generates compact and explicit 3DGS data. A dual-channel sparse representation is introduced to supervise the primitive position and feature bit depth. It then utilizes a canonical point cloud encoder to perform further data compression and form standard output bitstreams. A simple and effective rate control scheme is proposed to pivot the interpretable data compression scheme. At the current stage, HybridGS does not include any modules aimed at improving 3DGS quality during generation. But experiment results show that it still provides comparable reconstruction performance against state-of-the-art methods, with evidently higher encoding and decoding speed. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Qi-Yangsjtu/HybridGS.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

To achieve robust policy learning and generalization, we opt to learn a world model of the 3D rigid body dynamics involved in non-prehensile manipulations and use it for model-based reinforcement learning. We propose PIN-WM, a Physics-INformed World Model that enables efficient end-to-end identification of a 3D rigid body dynamical system from visual observations. Adopting differentiable physics simulation, PIN-WM can be learned with only few-shot and task-agnostic physical interaction trajectories. Further, PIN-WM is learned with observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without needing state estimation. To bridge Sim2Real gaps, we turn the learned PIN-WM into a group of Digital Cousins via physics-aware randomizations which perturb physics and rendering parameters to generate diverse and meaningful variations of the PIN-WM. Extensive evaluations on both simulation and real-world tests demonstrate that PIN-WM, enhanced with physics-aware digital cousins, facilitates learning robust non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real transfer, surpassing the Real2Sim2Real state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Robot...</summary><p>Robotics: Science and Systems 2025</p></details> |

However, the quality of underwater images is often degraded due to medium interference, which limits the effectiveness of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pose estimation, leading to subsequent reconstruction failures. Additionally, SfM methods typically operate at slower speeds, further hindering their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we introduce AquaGS, an SfM-free underwater scene reconstruction model based on the SeaThru algorithm, which facilitates rapid and accurate separation of scene details and medium features. Our approach initializes Gaussians by integrating state-of-the-art multi-view stereo (MVS) technology, employs implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for rendering translucent media and utilizes the latest explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to render object surfaces, which effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods and accurately simulates underwater optical phenomena.

However, existing methods still face substantial challenges in capturing fine geometric details and maintaining animation stability, particularly under dynamic or complex poses. To address these issues, we propose a novel real-time framework for animatable human avatar reconstruction based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). By leveraging 2DGS and global SMPL pose parameters, our framework not only aligns positional and rotational discrepancies but also enables robust and natural pose-driven animation of the reconstructed avatars. Furthermore, we introduce a Rotation Compensation Network (RCN) that learns rotation residuals by integrating local geometric features with global pose parameters. This network significantly improves the handling of non-rigid deformations and ensures smooth, artifact-free pose transitions during animation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully reconstructs realistic and highly animatable human avatars from monocular videos, effectively preserving fine-grained details while ensuring stable and natural pose variation. Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and animation robustness on public benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, specular reflection and refraction continue to pose significant challenges due to the instability and incorrect overfitting of radiance fields to high-frequency light variations. Currently, even 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), as a powerful and efficient tool, falls short in recovering transparent objects with nearby contents due to the existence of apparent secondary ray effects. To address this issue, we propose TransparentGS, a fast inverse rendering pipeline for transparent objects based on 3D-GS. The main contributions are three-fold. Firstly, an efficient representation of transparent objects, transparent Gaussian primitives, is designed to enable specular refraction through a deferred refraction strategy. Secondly, we leverage Gaussian light field probes (GaussProbe) to encode both ambient light and nearby contents in a unified framework. Thirdly, a depth-based iterative probes query (IterQuery) algorithm is proposed to reduce the parallax errors in our probe-based framework. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our approach in recovering transparent objects from complex environments, as well as several applications in computer graphics and vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025; https://letianhuang.github.io/transparentgs/</p></details> |

First, the method uses 3DGS to render a synthetic RGBD image at some initial pose estimate. Second, it establishes 2D-2D correspondences between the query image and this synthetic image. Third, it uses the depth map to lift the 2D-2D correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences and solves a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem to produce a final pose estimate. Results from evaluation across three existing datasets with 38 scenes and over 2,700 test images show that our method significantly reduces both inference time (by over two orders of magnitude, from more than 10 seconds to as fast as 0.1 seconds) and estimation error compared to baseline methods that use photometric loss minimization. Results also show that our method tolerates large errors in the initial pose estimate of up to 55{\deg} in rotation and 1.1 units in translation (normalized by scene scale), achieving final pose errors of less than 5{\deg} in rotation and 0.05 units in translation on 90% of images from the Synthetic NeRF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets and on 42% of images from the more challenging Tanks and Temples dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D StreetUnveiler with Semantic-aware 2DGS -- a simple baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18416v4)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unveiling an empty street from crowded observations captured by in-car cameras is crucial for autonomous driving. However, removing all temporarily static objects, such as stopped vehicles and standing pedestrians, presents a significant challenge. Unlike object-centric 3D inpainting, which relies on thorough observation in a small scene, street scene cases involve long trajectories that differ from previous 3D inpainting tasks. The camera-centric moving environment of captured videos further complicates the task due to the limited degree and time duration of object observation. To address these obstacles, we introduce StreetUnveiler to reconstruct an empty street. StreetUnveiler learns a 3D representation of the empty street from crowded observations. Our representation is based on the hard-label semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for its scalability and ability to identify Gaussians to be removed. We inpaint rendered image after removing unwanted Gaussians to provide pseudo-labels and subsequently re-optimize the 2DGS. Given its temporal continuous movement, we divide the empty street scene into observed, partial-observed, and unobserved regions, which we propose to locate through a rendered alpha map. This decomposition helps us to minimize the regions that need to be inpainted. To enhance the temporal consistency of the inpainting, we introduce a novel time-reversal framework to inpaint frames in reverse order and use later frames as references for earlier frames to fully utilize the long-trajectory observations.

In this work, we introduce 4DGS-CC, a contextual coding framework that compresses 4DGS data to meet specific storage constraints. Building upon the established deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method, our approach decomposes 4DGS data into 4D neural voxels and a canonical 3DGS component, which are then compressed using Neural Voxel Contextual Coding (NVCC) and Vector Quantization Contextual Coding (VQCC), respectively. Specifically, we first decompose the 4D neural voxels into distinct quantized features by separating the temporal and spatial dimensions. To losslessly compress each quantized feature, we leverage the previously compressed features from the temporal and spatial dimensions as priors and apply NVCC to generate the spatiotemporal context for contextual coding. Next, we employ a codebook to store spherical harmonics information from canonical 3DGS as quantized vectors, which are then losslessly compressed by using VQCC with the auxiliary learned hyperpriors for contextual coding, thereby reducing redundancy within the codebook. By integrating NVCC and VQCC, our contextual coding framework, 4DGS-CC, enables multi-rate 4DGS data compression tailored to specific storage requirements. Extensive experiments on three 4DGS data compression benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an average storage reduction of approximately 12 times while maintaining rendering fidelity compared to our baseline 4DGS approach.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the 3D reconstruction techniques for plant phenotyping, covering classical reconstruction methods, emerging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and the novel 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approach. Classical methods, which often rely on high-resolution sensors, are widely adopted due to their simplicity and flexibility in representing plant structures. However, they face challenges such as data density, noise, and scalability. NeRF, a recent advancement, enables high-quality, photorealistic 3D reconstructions from sparse viewpoints, but its computational cost and applicability in outdoor environments remain areas of active research. The emerging 3DGS technique introduces a new paradigm in reconstructing plant structures by representing geometry through Gaussian primitives, offering potential benefits in both efficiency and scalability. We review the methodologies, applications, and performance of these approaches in plant phenotyping and discuss their respective strengths, limitations, and future prospects (https://github.com/JiajiaLi04/3D-Reconstruction-Plants). Through this review, we aim to provide insights into how these diverse 3D reconstruction techniques can be effectively leveraged for automated and high-throughput plant phenotyping, contributing to the next generation of agricultural technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[GaussTrap: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on 3D Gaussian Splatting for Targeted Scene Confusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20829v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a breakthrough in scene representation and novel view synthesis, its rapid adoption in safety-critical domains (e.g., autonomous systems, AR/VR) urgently demands scrutiny of potential security vulnerabilities. This paper presents the first systematic study of backdoor threats in 3DGS pipelines. We identify that adversaries may implant backdoor views to induce malicious scene confusion during inference, potentially leading to environmental misperception in autonomous navigation or spatial distortion in immersive environments. To uncover this risk, we propose GuassTrap, a novel poisoning attack method targeting 3DGS models. GuassTrap injects malicious views at specific attack viewpoints while preserving high-quality rendering in non-target views, ensuring minimal detectability and maximizing potential harm. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a three-stage pipeline (attack, stabilization, and normal training) to implant stealthy, viewpoint-consistent poisoned renderings in 3DGS, jointly optimizing attack efficacy and perceptual realism to expose security risks in 3D rendering. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GuassTrap can effectively embed imperceptible yet harmful backdoor views while maintaining high-quality rendering in normal views, validating its robustness, adaptability, and practical applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[GauSS-MI: Gaussian Splatting Shannon Mutual Information for Active 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21067v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research tackles the challenge of real-time active view selection and uncertainty quantification on visual quality for active 3D reconstruction. Visual quality is a critical aspect of 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have notably enhanced the image rendering quality of reconstruction models. Nonetheless, the efficient and effective acquisition of input images for reconstruction-specifically, the selection of the most informative viewpoint-remains an open challenge, which is crucial for active reconstruction. Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating geometric completeness and exploring unobserved or unknown regions, without direct evaluation of the visual uncertainty within the reconstruction model. To address this gap, this paper introduces a probabilistic model that quantifies visual uncertainty for each Gaussian. Leveraging Shannon Mutual Information, we formulate a criterion, Gaussian Splatting Shannon Mutual Information (GauSS-MI), for real-time assessment of visual mutual information from novel viewpoints, facilitating the selection of next best view. GauSS-MI is implemented within an active reconstruction system integrated with a view and motion planner. Extensive experiments across various simulated and real-world scenes showcase the superior visual quality and reconstruction efficiency performance of the proposed system.</p></details> |  |

Existing Neural SLAM or 3DGS-based SLAM methods often trade off between rendering quality and geometry accuracy, our research demonstrates that both can be achieved simultaneously with RGB input alone. The key idea of our approach is to enhance the ability for geometry estimation by combining easy-to-obtain monocular priors with learning-based dense SLAM, and then using 3D Gaussian splatting as our core map representation to efficiently model the scene. Upon loop closure, our method ensures on-the-fly global consistency through efficient pose graph bundle adjustment and instant map updates by explicitly deforming the 3D Gaussian units based on anchored keyframe updates. Furthermore, we introduce a grid-based scale alignment strategy to maintain improved scale consistency in prior depths for finer depth details. Through extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++, we demonstrate significant improvements over existing Neural SLAM methods and even surpass RGB-D-based methods in both reconstruction and rendering quality.

| **[EfficientHuman: Efficient Training and Reconstruction of Moving Human using Articulated 2D Gaussian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20607v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been recognized as a pioneering technique in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Recent work on reconstructing the 3D human body using 3DGS attempts to leverage prior information on human pose to enhance rendering quality and improve training speed. However, it struggles to effectively fit dynamic surface planes due to multi-view inconsistency and redundant Gaussians. This inconsistency arises because Gaussian ellipsoids cannot accurately represent the surfaces of dynamic objects, which hinders the rapid reconstruction of the dynamic human body. Meanwhile, the prevalence of redundant Gaussians means that the training time of these works is still not ideal for quickly fitting a dynamic human body. To address these, we propose EfficientHuman, a model that quickly accomplishes the dynamic reconstruction of the human body using Articulated 2D Gaussian while ensuring high rendering quality. The key innovation involves encoding Gaussian splats as Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels in canonical space and then transforming them to pose space via Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) to achieve efficient pose transformations. Unlike 3D Gaussians, Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels can quickly conform to the dynamic human body while ensuring view-consistent geometries. Additionally, we introduce a pose calibration module and an LBS optimization module to achieve precise fitting of dynamic human poses, enhancing the model's performance. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-MoCap dataset demonstrate that EfficientHuman achieves rapid 3D dynamic human reconstruction in less than a minute on average, which is 20 seconds faster than the current state-of-the-art method, while also reducing the number of redundant Gaussians.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Creating Your Editable 3D Photorealistic Avatar with Tetrahedron-constrained Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20403v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized 3D avatar editing holds significant promise due to its user-friendliness and availability to applications such as AR/VR and virtual try-ons. Previous studies have explored the feasibility of 3D editing, but often struggle to generate visually pleasing results, possibly due to the unstable representation learning under mixed optimization of geometry and texture in complicated reconstructed scenarios. In this paper, we aim to provide an accessible solution for ordinary users to create their editable 3D avatars with precise region localization, geometric adaptability, and photorealistic renderings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a meticulously designed framework that decouples the editing process into local spatial adaptation and realistic appearance learning, utilizing a hybrid Tetrahedron-constrained Gaussian Splatting (TetGS) as the underlying representation. TetGS combines the controllable explicit structure of tetrahedral grids with the high-precision rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting and is optimized in a progressive manner comprising three stages: 3D avatar instantiation from real-world monocular videos to provide accurate priors for TetGS initialization; localized spatial adaptation with explicitly partitioned tetrahedrons to guide the redistribution of Gaussian kernels; and geometry-based appearance generation with a coarse-to-fine activation strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in generating photorealistic 3D editable avatars.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods relying on dense views struggle with extremely sparse Structure-from-Motion points for initialization. While learning-based Multi-view Stereo (MVS) provides dense 3D points, directly combining it with Gaussian Splatting leads to suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-view geometric optimization. We propose Sparse2DGS, an MVS-initialized Gaussian Splatting pipeline for complete and accurate reconstruction. Our key insight is to incorporate the geometric-prioritized enhancement schemes, allowing for direct and robust geometric learning under ill-posed conditions. Sparse2DGS outperforms existing methods by notable margins while being ${2}\times$ faster than the NeRF-based fine-tuning approach.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Mesh-Learner: Texturing Mesh with Spherical Harmonics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19938v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e., texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each mesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render, which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast, unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM, which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping). To benefit the society, the code will be available at https://github.com/hku-mars/Mesh-Learner.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a framework of 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency (3DGIC) for cross-view consistent 3D inpainting. Guided by the rendered depth information from each training view, our 3DGIC exploits background pixels visible across different views for updating the inpainting mask, allowing us to refine the 3DGS for inpainting purposes.Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we confirm that our 3DGIC outperforms current state-of-the-art 3D inpainting methods quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[CE-NPBG: Connectivity Enhanced Neural Point-Based Graphics for Novel View Synthesis in Autonomous Driving Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19557v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current point-based approaches encounter limitations in scalability and rendering quality when using large 3D point cloud maps because using them directly for novel view synthesis (NVS) leads to degraded visualizations. We identify the primary issue behind these low-quality renderings as a visibility mismatch between geometry and appearance, stemming from using these two modalities together. To address this problem, we present CE-NPBG, a new approach for novel view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale autonomous driving scenes. Our method is a neural point-based technique that leverages two modalities: posed images (cameras) and synchronized raw 3D point clouds (LiDAR). We first employ a connectivity relationship graph between appearance and geometry, which retrieves points from a large 3D point cloud map observed from the current camera perspective and uses them for rendering. By leveraging this connectivity, our method significantly improves rendering quality and enhances run-time and scalability by using only a small subset of points from the large 3D point cloud map. Our approach associates neural descriptors with the points and uses them to synthesize views. To enhance the encoding of these descriptors and elevate rendering quality, we propose a joint adversarial and point rasterization training. During training, we pair an image-synthesizer network with a multi-resolution discriminator. At inference, we decouple them and use the image-synthesizer to generate novel views. We also integrate our proposal into the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting work to highlight its benefits for improved rendering and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |
| **[Free-DyGS: Camera-Pose-Free Scene Reconstruction for Dynamic Surgical Videos with Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01003v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity reconstruction of surgical scene is a fundamentally crucial task to support many applications, such as intra-operative navigation and surgical education. However, most existing methods assume the ideal surgical scenarios - either focus on dynamic reconstruction with deforming tissue yet assuming a given fixed camera pose, or allow endoscope movement yet reconstructing the static scenes. In this paper, we target at a more realistic yet challenging setup - free-pose reconstruction with a moving camera for highly dynamic surgical scenes. Meanwhile, we take the first step to introduce Gaussian Splitting (GS) technique to tackle this challenging setting and propose a novel GS-based framework for fast reconstruction, termed \textit{Free-DyGS}. Concretely, our model embraces a novel scene initialization in which a pre-trained Sparse Gaussian Regressor (SGR) can efficiently parameterize the initial attributes. For each subsequent frame, we propose to jointly optimize the deformation model and 6D camera poses in a frame-by-frame manner, easing training given the limited deformation differences between consecutive frames. A Scene Expansion scheme is followed to expand the GS model for the unseen regions introduced by the moving camera. Moreover, the framework is equipped with a novel Retrospective Deformation Recapitulation (RDR) strategy to preserve the entire-clip deformations throughout the frame-by-frame training scheme. The efficacy of the proposed Free-DyGS is substantiated through extensive experiments on two datasets: StereoMIS and Hamlyn datasets. The experimental outcomes underscore that Free-DyGS surpasses other advanced methods in both rendering accuracy and efficiency. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[GS-ROR$^2$: Bidirectional-guided 3DGS and SDF for Reflective Object Relighting and Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18544v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown a powerful capability for novel view synthesis due to its detailed expressive ability and highly efficient rendering speed. Unfortunately, creating relightable 3D assets and reconstructing faithful geometry with 3DGS is still problematic, particularly for reflective objects, as its discontinuous representation raises difficulties in constraining geometries. Volumetric signed distance field (SDF) methods provide robust geometry reconstruction, while the expensive ray marching hinders its real-time application and slows the training. Besides, these methods struggle to capture sharp geometric details. To this end, we propose to guide 3DGS and SDF bidirectionally in a complementary manner, including an SDF-aided Gaussian splatting for efficient optimization of the relighting model and a GS-guided SDF enhancement for high-quality geometry reconstruction. At the core of our SDF-aided Gaussian splatting is the mutual supervision of the depth and normal between blended Gaussians and SDF, which avoids the expensive volume rendering of SDF. Thanks to this mutual supervision, the learned blended Gaussians are well-constrained with a minimal time cost. As the Gaussians are rendered in a deferred shading mode, the alpha-blended Gaussians are smooth, while individual Gaussians may still be outliers, yielding floater artifacts. Therefore, we introduce an SDF-aware pruning strategy to remove Gaussian outliers located distant from the surface defined by SDF, avoiding floater issue. This way, our GS framework provides reasonable normal and achieves realistic relighting, while the mesh from depth is still problematic. Therefore, we design a GS-guided SDF refinement, which utilizes the blended normal from Gaussians to finetune SDF. With this enhancement, our method can further provide high-quality meshes for reflective objects at the cost of 17% extra training time.</p></details> |  |

While existing 3DGS methods perform well in scenes with minor view variation, large view changes from cross-view data pose optimization challenges for these methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-view Gaussian Splatting method for large-scale scene reconstruction based on multi-branch construction and fusion. Our method independently reconstructs models from different sets of views as multiple independent branches to establish the baselines of Gaussian distribution, providing reliable priors for cross-view reconstruction during initialization and densification. Specifically, a gradient-aware regularization strategy is introduced to mitigate smoothing issues caused by significant view disparities. Additionally, a unique Gaussian supplementation strategy is utilized to incorporate complementary information of multi-branch into the cross-view model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in novel view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified framework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely on 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity and noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of appearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently optimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using various forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both tracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D ground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance with 95.03\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\times$ speedup with only marginal performance degradation.</p></details> |  |

Unlike object-based tasks, such as generating 360{\deg} views of a car, scene view synthesis handles entire environments where non-uniform observations pose unique challenges for stable rendering quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: renderability field-guided gaussian splatting (RF-GS). This method quantifies input inhomogeneity through a renderability field, guiding pseudo-view sampling to enhanced visual consistency. To ensure the quality of wide-baseline pseudo-views, we train an image restoration model to map point projections to visible-light styles. Additionally, our validated hybrid data optimization strategy effectively fuses information of pseudo-view angles and source view textures. Comparative experiments on simulated and real-world data show that our method outperforms existing approaches in rendering stability.</p></details> | 8 pages,8 figures |

Existing methods suffer several drawbacks, such as requiring multi-view data, time-consuming per-scene optimization, distorted geometry in occluded areas, and low visual quality in backgrounds. Our novel 3D scene reconstruction pipeline overcomes these limitations to tackle the aforesaid challenge. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale reconstruction model that leverages latents from a video diffusion model to predict 3D Gaussian Splattings of scenes in a feed-forward manner. The video diffusion model is designed to create videos precisely following specified camera trajectories, allowing it to generate compressed video latents that encode multi-view information while maintaining 3D consistency. We train the 3D reconstruction model to operate on the video latent space with a progressive learning strategy, enabling the efficient generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes. Extensive evaluations across various datasets affirm that our model significantly outperforms existing single-view 3D scene generation methods, especially with out-of-domain images. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that a 3D reconstruction model can effectively be built upon the latent space of a diffusion model in order to realize efficient 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/wonderland/</p></details> |

However, they have seen limited application in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. This is due to the difficulty in reasoning about collisions in radiance models and the computational complexity associated with operating in dense models. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer operating in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method to rigorously upper-bound the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field.

However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.</p></details> |  |

However, rendering large-scale volumes demands powerful GPUs and high-speed memory access for real-time performance. While existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods offer faster rendering speeds with lower hardware requirements, the visible parts of a reconstructed scene are fixed and constrained by preset TF settings, significantly limiting user exploration. This paper introduces inverse volume rendering via Gaussian splatting (iVR-GS), an innovative NVS method that reduces the rendering cost while enabling scene editing for interactive volume exploration. Specifically, we compose multiple iVR-GS models associated with basic TFs covering disjoint visible parts to make the entire volumetric scene visible. Each basic model contains a collection of 3D editable Gaussians, where each Gaussian is a 3D spatial point that supports real-time scene rendering and editing. We demonstrate the superior reconstruction quality and composability of iVR-GS against other NVS solutions (Plenoxels, CCNeRF, and base 3DGS) on various volume datasets.

However, the latent representations learnt by these methods are highly entangled and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel part-aware compositional reconstruction method, called GaussianBlock, that enables semantically coherent and disentangled representations, allowing for precise and physical editing akin to building blocks, while simultaneously maintaining high fidelity. Our GaussianBlock introduces a hybrid representation that leverages the advantages of both primitives, known for their flexible actionability and editability, and 3D Gaussians, which excel in reconstruction quality. Specifically, we achieve semantically coherent primitives through a novel attention-guided centering loss derived from 2D semantic priors, complemented by a dynamic splitting and fusion strategy. Furthermore, we utilize 3D Gaussians that hybridize with primitives to refine structural details and enhance fidelity. Additionally, a binding inheritance strategy is employed to strengthen and maintain the connection between the two. Our reconstructed scenes are evidenced to be disentangled, compositional, and compact across diverse benchmarks, enabling seamless, direct and precise editing while maintaining high quality.</p></details> |  |

However, most works rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, which limits the capturing of richer scene details. Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which is time-consuming and challenging in practice. For a more flexible data acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying unknown exposure time. \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and rendering quality.

The rendering with GESs consists of two passes -- surfels are first rasterized through a standard graphics pipeline to produce depth and color maps, and then Gaussians are splatted with depth testing and color accumulation on each pixel order independently. The optimization of GESs from multi-view images is performed through an elaborate coarse-to-fine procedure, faithfully capturing rich scene appearance. The entirely sorting-free rendering of GESs not only achieves very fast rates, but also produces view-consistent images, successfully avoiding popping artifacts under view changes. The basic GES representation can be easily extended to achieve anti-aliasing in rendering (Mip-GES), boosted rendering speeds (Speedy-GES) and compact storage (Compact-GES), and reconstruct better scene geometries by replacing 3D Gaussians with 2D Gaussians (2D-GES). Experimental results show that GESs advance the state-of-the-arts as a compelling representation for ultra-fast high-fidelity radiance field rendering.</p></details> |  |

However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems usually struggle with large scene representation and lack effective loop closure detection. To address these issues, we introduce NGM-SLAM, the first 3DGS based SLAM system that utilizes neural radiance field submaps for progressive scene expression, effectively integrating the strengths of neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. We utilize neural radiance field submaps as supervision and achieve high-quality scene expression and online loop closure adjustments through Gaussian rendering of fused submaps. Our results on multiple real-world scenes and large-scale scene datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate hole filling and high-quality scene expression, supporting monocular, stereo, and RGB-D inputs, and achieving state-of-the-art scene reconstruction and tracking performance.</p></details> | 9pages, 4 figures |

This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-view scenarios, where variations in lighting and image signal processor (ISP) settings across viewpoints introduce photometric inconsistencies. Such lighting degradations and view-dependent variations pose substantial challenges to novel view synthesis (NVS) frameworks based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To address this, we introduce Luminance-GS, a novel approach to achieving high-quality novel view synthesis results under diverse challenging lighting conditions using 3DGS. By adopting per-view color matrix mapping and view-adaptive curve adjustments, Luminance-GS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various lighting conditions -- including low-light, overexposure, and varying exposure -- while not altering the original 3DGS explicit representation. Compared to previous NeRF- and 3DGS-based baselines, Luminance-GS provides real-time rendering speed with improved reconstruction quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, project page: https://cuiziteng.github.io/Luminance_GS_web/</p></details> |

We utilize recent advancements in 3D reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting for 3D object placement in driving scenes. Unlike existing diffusion-based methods that synthesize images conditioned on BEV layouts, our approach places 3D objects directly in the reconstructed 3D space with explicitly imposed geometric transformations. This ensures both the physical plausibility of object placement and highly accurate 3D pose and position annotations. Our experiments demonstrate that even by integrating a limited number of external 3D objects into real scenes, the augmented data significantly enhances 3D object detection performance and outperforms existing diffusion-based 3D augmentation for object detection. Extensive testing on the nuScenes dataset reveals that imposing high geometric diversity in object placement has a greater impact compared to the appearance diversity of objects. Additionally, we show that generating hard examples, either by maximizing detection loss or imposing high visual occlusion in camera images, does not lead to more efficient 3D data augmentation for camera-based 3D object detection in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances like neural rendering and 3D Gaussian splatting have enabled high-quality digital human avatar creation and animation, most methods rely on multiple images or multi-view inputs, limiting their practicality for real-world use. In this paper, we propose SEGA, a novel approach for Single-imagE-based 3D drivable Gaussian head Avatar creation that combines generalized prior models with a new hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework. SEGA seamlessly combines priors derived from large-scale 2D datasets with 3D priors learned from multi-view, multi-expression, and multi-ID data, achieving robust generalization to unseen identities while ensuring 3D consistency across novel viewpoints and expressions. We further present a hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework that leverages FLAME-based structural priors and employs a dual-branch architecture to disentangle dynamic and static facial components effectively. The dynamic branch encodes expression-driven fine details, while the static branch focuses on expression-invariant regions, enabling efficient parameter inference and precomputation. This design maximizes the utility of limited 3D data and achieves real-time performance for animation and rendering. Additionally, SEGA performs person-specific fine-tuning to further enhance the fidelity and realism of the generated avatars. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generalization ability, identity preservation, and expression realism, advancing one-shot avatar creation for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Our method optimizes data partitioning and the reconstruction pipeline by incorporating a hierarchical neural Gaussian representation. We employ an enhanced block-based reconstruction pipeline focusing on improving reconstruction quality within each block and reducing the need for redundant training regions around block boundaries. By integrating neural Gaussian representation with a hierarchical architecture, we achieve high-quality scene rendering at a low computational cost. This is demonstrated by our state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks, which prove the effectiveness and advantages in large-scale urban scene representation.</p></details> |  |

However, such extreme sparsity levels limit the seamless usage of ToF depth in SLAM. In this work, we propose ToF-Splatting, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM pipeline tailored for using effectively very sparse ToF input data. Our approach improves upon the state of the art by introducing a multi-frame integration module, which produces dense depth maps by merging cues from extremely sparse ToF depth, monocular color, and multi-view geometry. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real sparse ToF datasets demonstrate the viability of our approach, as it achieves state-of-the-art tracking and mapping performances on reference datasets.</p></details> |  |

Training to get a 3DGS scene often takes a lot of time and resources and even valuable inspiration. The increasing amount of 3DGS digital asset have brought great challenges to the copyright protection. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. In this paper, we propose a new framework X-SG$^2$S which can simultaneously watermark 1 to 3D messages while keeping the original 3DGS scene almost unchanged. Generally, we have a X-SG$^2$S injector for adding multi-modal messages simultaneously and an extractor for extract them. Specifically, we first split the watermarks into message patches in a fixed manner and sort the 3DGS points. A self-adaption gate is used to pick out suitable location for watermarking. Then use a XD(multi-dimension)-injection heads to add multi-modal messages into sorted 3DGS points. A learnable gate can recognize the location with extra messages and XD-extraction heads can restore hidden messages from the location recommended by the learnable gate. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed X-SG$^2$S can effectively conceal multi modal messages without changing pretrained 3DGS pipeline or the original form of 3DGS parameters. Meanwhile, with simple and efficient model structure and high practicality, X-SG$^2$S still shows good performance in hiding and extracting multi-modal inner structured or unstructured messages. X-SG$^2$S is the first to unify 1 to 3D watermarking model for 3DGS and the first framework to add multi-modal watermarks simultaneous in one 3DGS which pave the wave for later researches.</p></details> |  |

This paper extends 3DGS capabilities to inpainting, where masked objects in a scene are replaced with new contents that blend seamlessly with the surroundings. Unlike 2D image inpainting, 3D Gaussian inpainting (3DGI) is challenging in effectively leveraging complementary visual and semantic cues from multiple input views, as occluded areas in one view may be visible in others. To address this, we propose a method that measures the visibility uncertainties of 3D points across different input views and uses them to guide 3DGI in utilizing complementary visual cues. We also employ uncertainties to learn a semantic concept of scene without the masked object and use a diffusion model to fill masked objects in input images based on the learned concept. Finally, we build a novel 3DGI framework, VISTA, by integrating VISibility-uncerTainty-guided 3DGI with scene conceptuAl learning. VISTA generates high-quality 3DGS models capable of synthesizing artifact-free and naturally inpainted novel views. Furthermore, our approach extends to handling dynamic distractors arising from temporal object changes, enhancing its versatility in diverse scene reconstruction scenarios. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art techniques using two challenging datasets: the SPIn-NeRF dataset, featuring 10 diverse static 3D inpainting scenes, and an underwater 3D inpainting dataset derived from UTB180, including fast-moving fish as inpainting targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, ICCV</p></details> |

However, these videos present a challenge to existing pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift accumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting, which maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable novel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this, we propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically designed for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses using Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in each video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal consistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced the requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose estimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g. DINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering enhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian splatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features, SmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature correspondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of SmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves impressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and DORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes.

| **[HEMGS: A Hybrid Entropy Model for 3D Gaussian Splatting Data Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18473v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel compression framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data. Building on anchor-based 3DGS methodologies, our approach compresses all attributes within each anchor by introducing a novel Hybrid Entropy Model for 3D Gaussian Splatting (HEMGS) to achieve hybrid lossy-lossless compression. It consists of three main components: a variable-rate predictor, a hyperprior network, and an autoregressive network. First, unlike previous methods that adopt multiple models to achieve multi-rate lossy compression, thereby increasing training overhead, our variable-rate predictor enables variable-rate compression with a single model and a hyperparameter $\lambda$ by producing a learned Quantization Step feature for versatile lossy compression. Second, to improve lossless compression, the hyperprior network captures both scene-agnostic and scene-specific features to generate a prior feature, while the autoregressive network employs an adaptive context selection algorithm with flexible receptive fields to produce a contextual feature. By integrating these two features, HEMGS can accurately estimate the distribution of the current coding element within each attribute, enabling improved entropy coding and reduced storage. We integrate HEMGS into a compression framework, and experimental results on four benchmarks indicate that HEMGS achieves about a 40% average reduction in size while maintaining rendering quality over baseline methods and achieving state-of-the-art compression results.</p></details> |  |

However, this often results in increased noise and artifacts due to limited data. In this paper we propose a novel 3D Gaussian representation (3DGR) based method for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Inspired by recent success in novel view synthesis driven by 3D Gaussian splatting, we leverage the efficiency and expressiveness of 3D Gaussian representation as an alternative to implicit neural representation. To unleash the potential of 3DGR for CT imaging scenario, we propose two key innovations: (i) FBP-image-guided Guassian initialization and (ii) efficient integration with a differentiable CT projector. Extensive experiments and ablations on diverse datasets demonstrate the proposed 3DGR-CT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art counterpart methods, achieving higher reconstruction accuracy with faster convergence. Furthermore, we showcase the potential of 3DGR-CT for real-time physical simulation, which holds important clinical applications while challenging for implicit neural representations.</p></details> |  |

Some recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are proposed to reconstruct the thermal scenes in 3D from a set of thermal and RGB images. However, unlike NeRF, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) prevails due to its rapid training and real-time rendering. In this work, we propose ThermalGaussian, the first thermal 3DGS approach capable of rendering high-quality images in RGB and thermal modalities. We first calibrate the RGB camera and the thermal camera to ensure that both modalities are accurately aligned. Subsequently, we use the registered images to learn the multimodal 3D Gaussians. To prevent the overfitting of any single modality, we introduce several multimodal regularization constraints. We also develop smoothing constraints tailored to the physical characteristics of the thermal modality. Besides, we contribute a real-world dataset named RGBT-Scenes, captured by a hand-hold thermal-infrared camera, facilitating future research on thermal scene reconstruction. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that ThermalGaussian achieves photorealistic rendering of thermal images and improves the rendering quality of RGB images. With the proposed multimodal regularization constraints, we also reduced the model's storage cost by 90%.

This approach shows universal compatibility with existing 3DGS frameworks, including vanilla 3DGS and Mip-Splatting, consistently achieving accelerated training while maintaining superior synthesis quality. Extensive experiments reveal that our straightforward Group Training strategy achieves up to 30% faster convergence and improved rendering quality across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We propose StyleMe3D, a holistic framework for 3D GS style transfer that integrates multi-modal style conditioning, multi-level semantic alignment, and perceptual quality enhancement. Our key insights include: (1) optimizing only RGB attributes preserves geometric integrity during stylization; (2) disentangling low-, medium-, and high-level semantics is critical for coherent style transfer; (3) scalability across isolated objects and complex scenes is essential for practical deployment. StyleMe3D introduces four novel components: Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD), leveraging Stable Diffusion's latent space for semantic alignment; Contrastive Style Descriptor (CSD) for localized, content-aware texture transfer; Simultaneously Optimized Scale (SOS) to decouple style details and structural coherence; and 3D Gaussian Quality Assessment (3DG-QA), a differentiable aesthetic prior trained on human-rated data to suppress artifacts and enhance visual harmony. Evaluated on NeRF synthetic dataset (objects) and tandt db (scenes) datasets, StyleMe3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving geometric details (e.g., carvings on sculptures) and ensuring stylistic consistency across scenes (e.g., coherent lighting in landscapes), while maintaining real-time rendering.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly concerning user experience across different setups. This paper introduces a novel VR-based teleoperation framework designed for a robotic manipulator integrated onto a mobile platform. Central to our approach is the application of Gaussian splatting, a technique that abstracts the manipulable scene into a VR environment, thereby enabling more intuitive and immersive interactions. Users can navigate and manipulate within the virtual scene as if interacting with a real robot, enhancing both the engagement and efficacy of teleoperation tasks. An extensive user study validates our approach, demonstrating significant usability and efficiency improvements.

Geometry reconstruction can benefit from incorporating differentiable appearance models, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods encounter efficiency issues due to indirect geometry learning and the paradigm of separately modeling geometry and surface appearance. In this work, we propose a learnable scene model that incorporates 3DGS with an explicit geometry representation, namely a mesh. Our model learns the mesh and appearance in an end-to-end manner, where we bind 3D Gaussians to the mesh faces and perform differentiable rendering of 3DGS to obtain photometric supervision. The model creates an effective information pathway to supervise the learning of both 3DGS and mesh. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned scene model not only improves efficiency and rendering quality but also enables manipulation via the explicit mesh. In addition, our model has a unique advantage in adapting to scene updates, thanks to the end-to-end learning of both mesh and appearance.</p></details> |  |

These methods commonly resort to using exponential family functions, such as the Gaussian function, as reconstruction kernels due to their anisotropic nature, ease of projection, and differentiability in rasterization. However, the field remains restricted to variations within the exponential family, leaving generalized reconstruction kernels largely underexplored, partly due to the lack of easy integrability in 3D to 2D projections. In this light, we show that a class of decaying anisotropic radial basis functions (DARBFs), which are non-negative functions of the Mahalanobis distance, supports splatting by approximating the Gaussian function's closed-form integration advantage. With this fresh perspective, we demonstrate up to 34% faster convergence during training and a 45% reduction in memory consumption across various DARB reconstruction kernels, while maintaining comparable PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS results.

However, the limited information from single-view input, combined with the complex head poses and facial movements, makes this challenging.

Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U. Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then, we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE, while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction, which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites.

| **[Robust Representation and Estimation of Barycenters and Modes of Probability Measures on Metric Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09609v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is concerned with the problem of defining and estimating statistics for distributions on spaces such as Riemannian manifolds and more general metric spaces. The challenge comes, in part, from the fact that statistics such as means and modes may be unstable: for example, a small perturbation to a distribution can lead to a large change in Fr\'echet means on spaces as simple as a circle. We address this issue by introducing a new merge tree representation of barycenters called the barycentric merge tree (BMT), which takes the form of a measured metric graph and summarizes features of the distribution in a multiscale manner. Modes are treated as special cases of barycenters through diffusion distances. In contrast to the properties of classical means and modes, we prove that BMTs are stable -- this is quantified as a Lipschitz estimate involving optimal transport metrics. This stability allows us to derive a consistency result for approximating BMTs from empirical measures, with explicit convergence rates. We also give a provably accurate method for discretely approximating the BMT construction and use this to provide numerical examples for distributions on spheres and shape spaces.</p></details> |  |

Existing relighting methods either rely on multiple input views to perform inverse rendering at inference time, or fail to provide explicit control over light changes. Our method fine-tunes a diffusion model on a small set of real raw photograph pairs, supplemented by synthetically rendered images at scale, to elicit its photorealistic prior for relighting. We leverage the linearity of light to synthesize image pairs depicting controlled light changes of either a target light source or ambient illumination. Using this data and an appropriate fine-tuning scheme, we train a model for precise illumination changes with explicit control over light intensity and color. Lastly, we show how our method can achieve compelling light editing results, and outperforms existing methods based on user preference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://nadmag.github.io/LightLab/</p></details> |
| **[The Niche Connectivity Paradox: Multichrome Contagions Overcome Vaccine Hesitancy more effectively than Monochromacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09605v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of vaccine hesitancy has caused a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis, alongside widespread skepticism and refusals of COVID-19 vaccinations. While categorizing individuals as either supportive of or opposed to vaccines provides a convenient dichotomy of vaccine attitudes, vaccine hesitancy is far more complex and dynamic. It involves wavering individuals whose attitudes fluctuate -- those who may exhibit pro-vaccine attitudes at one time and anti-vaccine attitudes at another. Here, we identify and analyze multichrome contagions as potential targets for intervention by leveraging a dataset of known pro-vax and anti-vax Twitter users ($n =135$ million) and a large COVID-19 Twitter dataset ($n = 3.5$ billion; including close analysis of $1,563,472$ unique individuals). We reconstruct an evolving multiplex sentiment landscape using top co-spreading issues, characterizing them as monochrome and multichrome contagions, based on their conceptual overlap with vaccination. We demonstrate switchers as deliberative: they are more moderate, engage with a wider range of topics, and occupy more central positions in their networks. Further examination of their information consumption shows that their discourse often engages with progressive issues such as climate change, which can serve as avenues for multichrome contagion interventions to promote pro-vaccine attitudes. Using data-driven intervention simulations, we demonstrate a paradox of niche connectivity, where multichrome contagions with fragmented, non-overlapping communities generate the highest levels of diffusion for pro-vaccine attitudes. Our work offers insights into harnessing synergistic hitchhiking effect of multichrome contagions to drive desired attitude and behavior changes in network-based interventions, particularly for overcoming vaccine hesitancy.</p></details> |  |
| **[VTLA: Vision-Tactile-Language-Action Model with Preference Learning for Insertion Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09577v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language models have advanced significantly, their application in language-conditioned robotic manipulation is still underexplored, especially for contact-rich tasks that extend beyond visually dominant pick-and-place scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vision-Tactile-Language-Action model, a novel framework that enables robust policy generation in contact-intensive scenarios by effectively integrating visual and tactile inputs through cross-modal language grounding. A low-cost, multi-modal dataset has been constructed in a simulation environment, containing vision-tactile-action-instruction pairs specifically designed for the fingertip insertion task. Furthermore, we introduce Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to offer regression-like supervision for the VTLA model, effectively bridging the gap between classification-based next token prediction loss and continuous robotic tasks. Experimental results show that the VTLA model outperforms traditional imitation learning methods (e.g., diffusion policies) and existing multi-modal baselines (TLA/VLA), achieving over 90% success rates on unseen peg shapes. Finally, we conduct real-world peg-in-hole experiments to demonstrate the exceptional Sim2Real performance of the proposed VTLA model.

| **[Don't Forget your Inverse DDIM for Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09571v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of text-to-image generation has undergone significant advancements with the introduction of diffusion models. Nevertheless, the challenge of editing real images persists, as most methods are either computationally intensive or produce poor reconstructions. This paper introduces SAGE (Self-Attention Guidance for image Editing) - a novel technique leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for image editing. SAGE builds upon the DDIM algorithm and incorporates a novel guidance mechanism utilizing the self-attention layers of the diffusion U-Net. This mechanism computes a reconstruction objective based on attention maps generated during the inverse DDIM process, enabling efficient reconstruction of unedited regions without the need to precisely reconstruct the entire input image. Thus, SAGE directly addresses the key challenges in image editing. The superiority of SAGE over other methods is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations and confirmed by a statistically validated comprehensive user study, in which all 47 surveyed users preferred SAGE over competing methods. Additionally, SAGE ranks as the top-performing method in seven out of 10 quantitative analyses and secures second and third places in the remaining three.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, code available at https://guillermogotre.github.io/sage/</p></details> |

Although design choices for image understanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and training recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain underexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and diffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a comprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis on image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies. Grounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a diffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in contrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both higher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first training on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers practical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while developing strong image generation ability. Finally, we carefully curate a high-quality instruction-tuning dataset BLIP3o-60k for image generation by prompting GPT-4o with a diverse set of captions covering various scenes, objects, human gestures, and more. Building on our innovative model design, training recipe, and datasets, we develop BLIP3-o, a suite of state-of-the-art unified multimodal models. BLIP3-o achieves superior performance across most of the popular benchmarks spanning both image understanding and generation tasks. To facilitate future research, we fully open-source our models, including code, model weights, training scripts, and pretraining and instruction tuning datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Long-Context Diffusion Policies via Past-Token Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09561v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning over long sequences of observations and actions is essential for many robotic tasks. Yet, learning effective long-context policies from demonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training becomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy performance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods typically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding historical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the retention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in imitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion policies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture essential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we introduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy learns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization significantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal reliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further introduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with short contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context embeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing memory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a self-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and select candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments across four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and accelerates policy training by more than 10x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Videos are available at https://long-context-dp.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Multimedia Generated by Large AI Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00045v5)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large AI Models (LAIMs), particularly diffusion models and large language models, has marked a new era where AI-generated multimedia is increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life. Although beneficial in numerous fields, this content presents significant risks, including potential misuse, societal disruptions, and ethical concerns. Consequently, detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs has become crucial, with a marked rise in related research. Despite this, there remains a notable gap in systematic surveys that focus specifically on detecting LAIM-generated multimedia. Addressing this, we provide the first survey to comprehensively cover existing research on detecting multimedia (such as text, images, videos, audio, and multimodal content) created by LAIMs. Specifically, we introduce a novel taxonomy for detection methods, categorized by media modality, and aligned with two perspectives: pure detection (aiming to enhance detection performance) and beyond detection (adding attributes like generalizability, robustness, and interpretability to detectors). Additionally, we have presented a brief overview of generation mechanisms, public datasets, online detection tools, and evaluation metrics to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in this field. Most importantly, we offer a focused analysis from a social media perspective to highlight their broader societal impact. Furthermore, we identify current challenges in detection and propose directions for future research that address unexplored, ongoing, and emerging issues in detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs. Our aim for this survey is to fill an academic gap and contribute to global AI security efforts, helping to ensure the integrity of information in the digital realm.

| **[Fragment-Masked Diffusion for Molecular Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09106v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, aimed at refining molecular structures to enhance drug efficacy and minimize side effects, ultimately accelerating the overall drug development process. Many molecular optimization methods have been proposed, significantly advancing drug discovery. These methods primarily on understanding the specific drug target structures or their hypothesized roles in combating diseases. However, challenges such as a limited number of available targets and a difficulty capturing clear structures hinder innovative drug development. In contrast, phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) does not depend on clear target structures and can identify hits with novel and unbiased polypharmacology signatures. As a result, PDD-based molecular optimization can reduce potential safety risks while optimizing phenotypic activity, thereby increasing the likelihood of clinical success. Therefore, we propose a fragment-masked molecular optimization method based on PDD (FMOP). FMOP employs a regression-free diffusion model to conditionally optimize the molecular masked regions, effectively generating new molecules with similar scaffolds. On the large-scale drug response dataset GDSCv2, we optimize the potential molecules across all 985 cell lines. The overall experiments demonstrate that the in-silico optimization success rate reaches 95.4\%, with an average efficacy increase of 7.5\%. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation and visualization experiments, confirming that FMOP is an effective and robust molecular optimization method. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FMOP-98C2.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Train a Multi-Task Diffusion Policy on RLBench-18 in One Day with One GPU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09430v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for training multi-task vision-language robotic diffusion policies that reduces training time and memory usage by an order of magnitude. This improvement arises from a previously underexplored distinction between action diffusion and the image diffusion techniques that inspired it: image generation targets are high-dimensional, while robot actions lie in a much lower-dimensional space. Meanwhile, the vision-language conditions for action generation remain high-dimensional. Our approach, Mini-Diffuser, exploits this asymmetry by introducing Level-2 minibatching, which pairs multiple noised action samples with each vision-language condition, instead of the conventional one-to-one sampling strategy. To support this batching scheme, we introduce architectural adaptations to the diffusion transformer that prevent information leakage across samples while maintaining full conditioning access. In RLBench simulations, Mini-Diffuser achieves 95\% of the performance of state-of-the-art multi-task diffusion policies, while using only 5\% of the training time and 7\% of the memory. Real-world experiments further validate that Mini-Diffuser preserves the key strengths of diffusion-based policies, including the ability to model multimodal action distributions and produce behavior conditioned on diverse perceptual inputs.

| **[Exploring Pose-Guided Imitation Learning for Robotic Precise Insertion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09424v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have proved that imitation learning shows strong potential in the field of robotic manipulation. However, existing methods still struggle with precision manipulation task and rely on inefficient image/point cloud observations. In this paper, we explore to introduce SE(3) object pose into imitation learning and propose the pose-guided efficient imitation learning methods for robotic precise insertion task. First, we propose a precise insertion diffusion policy which utilizes the relative SE(3) pose as the observation-action pair. The policy models the source object SE(3) pose trajectory relative to the target object. Second, we explore to introduce the RGBD data to the pose-guided diffusion policy. Specifically, we design a goal-conditioned RGBD encoder to capture the discrepancy between the current state and the goal state. In addition, a pose-guided residual gated fusion method is proposed, which takes pose features as the backbone, and the RGBD features selectively compensate for pose feature deficiencies through an adaptive gating mechanism. Our methods are evaluated on 6 robotic precise insertion tasks, demonstrating competitive performance with only 7-10 demonstrations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can successfully complete precision insertion tasks with a clearance of about 0.01 mm. Experimental results highlight its superior efficiency and generalization capability compared to existing baselines.

By removing the need for predefined motion inputs, it provides a flexible and accessible approach to controlling animated characters. This makes it especially useful in areas like virtual reality, gaming, human-computer interaction, and robotics. In this review, we first revisit the traditional perspective on motion synthesis, where models focused on predicting future poses from observed initial sequences, often conditioned on action labels. We then provide a comprehensive and structured survey of modern text-to-motion generation approaches, categorizing them from two complementary perspectives: (i) architectural, dividing methods into VAE-based, diffusion-based, and hybrid models; and (ii) motion representation, distinguishing between discrete and continuous motion generation strategies. In addition, we explore the most widely used datasets, evaluation methods, and recent benchmarks that have shaped progress in this area. With this survey, we aim to capture where the field currently stands, bring attention to its key challenges and limitations, and highlight promising directions for future exploration. We hope this work offers a valuable starting point for researchers and practitioners working to push the boundaries of language-driven human motion synthesis.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 tables |

First, the correction step employs a novel enhanced stochastic differential editing technique based on an imbalanced perturbation and denoising process, ensuring robust and effective bias correction at the low-resolution level. The robustness and effectiveness of this approach are validated theoretically and experimentally. Next, the super-resolution step leverages cascaded conditional diffusion models to iteratively refine the corrected data to high-resolution. Numerical experiments on three PDE problems and a climate dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances low-fidelity, low-resolution data by correcting numerical errors and noise while simultaneously improving resolution to recover fine-scale structures.</p></details> |  |

However, earlier reproducibility studies indicate that progress in this area may be quite limited. Specifically, various widespread methodological issues, e.g., comparisons with untuned baseline models, have led to an \emph{illusion of progress}. In this work, our goal is to examine whether these problems persist in today's research. To this end, we aim to reproduce the latest advancements reported from applying modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to recommender systems, focusing on four models published at the top-ranked SIGIR conference in 2023 and 2024. Our findings are concerning, revealing persistent methodological problems. Alarmingly, through experiments, we find that the latest recommendation techniques based on diffusion models, despite their computational complexity and substantial carbon footprint, are consistently outperformed by simpler existing models. Furthermore, we identify key mismatches between the characteristics of diffusion models and those of the traditional \emph{top-n} recommendation task, raising doubts about their suitability for recommendation. We also note that, in the papers we analyze, the generative capabilities of these models are constrained to a minimum. Overall, our results and continued methodological issues call for greater scientific rigor and a disruptive change in the research and publication culture in this area.</p></details> |  |

In data-scarce settings, the quality of these pretrained models becomes crucial for effective transfer learning. Image classification and self-supervised learning have traditionally been the primary methods for pretraining CNNs and transformer-based architectures. Recently, the rise of text-to-image generative models, particularly those using denoising diffusion in a latent space, has introduced a new class of foundational models trained on massive, captioned image datasets. These models' ability to generate realistic images of unseen content suggests they possess a deep understanding of the visual world. In this work, we present Marigold, a family of conditional generative models and a fine-tuning protocol that extracts the knowledge from pretrained latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and adapts them for dense image analysis tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normals prediction, and intrinsic decomposition. Marigold requires minimal modification of the pre-trained latent diffusion model's architecture, trains with small synthetic datasets on a single GPU over a few days, and demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization.

Starting from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, PRISM proposes an effective fine-tuning strategy to produce RGB images along with intrinsic maps (referred to as X layers) simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, which infer intrinsic properties individually or require separate models for decomposition and conditional generation, PRISM maintains consistency across modalities by generating all intrinsic layers jointly. It supports diverse tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. Additionally, PRISM enables both global and local image editing through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of PRISM both for intrinsic image decomposition and conditional image generation while preserving the base model's text-to-image generation capability.</p></details> |  |

Q-CATN employs a collaborative attention mechanism to effectively extract complementary information from multiple modalities and dynamically adjust its internal representations based on flexible q-space information, eliminating the need for fixed sampling schemes. Additionally, we introduce a range of task-specific constraints to preserve anatomical fidelity in DWI, enabling Q-CATN to accurately learn the intrinsic relationships between directional DWI signal distributions and q-space. Extensive experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that Q-CATN outperforms existing methods, including 1D-qDL, 2D-qDL, MESC-SD, and QGAN, in estimating parameter maps and fiber tracts both quantitatively and qualitatively, while preserving fine-grained details. Notably, its ability to accommodate flexible q-space sampling highlights its potential as a promising toolkit for clinical and research applications.

To tackle the mode collapse dilemma in generating high-quality diverse trajectories, we introduce a simple yet effective multi-modal representation decorrelation optimization mechanism during the training process.TransDiffuser achieves PDMS of 94.85 on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods without any anchor-based prior trajectories.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Bayesian computation with generative diffusion models by Multilevel Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15511v4)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful strategy to perform stochastic sampling in Bayesian inverse problems, delivering remarkably accurate solutions for a wide range of challenging applications. However, diffusion models often require a large number of neural function evaluations per sample in order to deliver accurate posterior samples. As a result, using diffusion models as stochastic samplers for Monte Carlo integration in Bayesian computation can be highly computationally expensive, particularly in applications that require a substantial number of Monte Carlo samples for conducting uncertainty quantification analyses. This cost is especially high in large-scale inverse problems such as computational imaging, which rely on large neural networks that are expensive to evaluate. With quantitative imaging applications in mind, this paper presents a Multilevel Monte Carlo strategy that significantly reduces the cost of Bayesian computation with diffusion models. This is achieved by exploiting cost-accuracy trade-offs inherent to diffusion models to carefully couple models of different levels of accuracy in a manner that significantly reduces the overall cost of the calculation, without reducing the final accuracy. The proposed approach achieves a $4\times$-to-$8\times$ reduction in computational cost w.r.t. standard techniques across three benchmark imaging problems.</p></details> | 13 images |

Recently, diffusion-based generative modeling shows promising potential for physical simulation. However, current approaches typically operate on on-grid data with preset spatiotemporal resolution, but struggle with the sparsely observed and continuous nature of real-world physical dynamics. To fill the gaps, we present SDIFT, Sequential DIffusion in Functional Tucker space, a novel framework that generates full-field evolution of physical dynamics from irregular sparse observations. SDIFT leverages the functional Tucker model as the latent space representer with proven universal approximation property, and represents observations as latent functions and Tucker core sequences. We then construct a sequential diffusion model with temporally augmented UNet in the functional Tucker space, denoising noise drawn from a Gaussian process to generate the sequence of core tensors. At the posterior sampling stage, we propose a Message-Passing Posterior Sampling mechanism, enabling conditional generation of the entire sequence guided by observations at limited time steps. We validate SDIFT on three physical systems spanning astronomical (supernova explosions, light-year scale), environmental (ocean sound speed fields, kilometer scale), and molecular (organic liquid, millimeter scale) domains, demonstrating significant improvements in both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Conventional LLMs and diffusion models fail to induce a convergent, iterative refinement process: each invocation of the diffusion mechanism spawns a new stochastic cycle, so successive outputs do not relate to prior ones and convergence toward a desired design is not guaranteed. The proposed hybrid framework - "LLM + semantic diffusion" - resolves this limitation by enforcing an approximately convergent search procedure, thereby formally addressing the problem of localized design refinement.</p></details> | 8 figures |
| **[Few-Shot Anomaly-Driven Generation for Anomaly Classification and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09263v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a practical and challenging task due to the scarcity of anomaly samples in industrial inspection. Some existing anomaly detection methods address this issue by synthesizing anomalies with noise or external data. However, there is always a large semantic gap between synthetic and real-world anomalies, resulting in weak performance in anomaly detection. To solve the problem, we propose a few-shot Anomaly-driven Generation (AnoGen) method, which guides the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies with only a few real anomalies, thereby benefiting training anomaly detection models. Specifically, our work is divided into three stages. In the first stage, we learn the anomaly distribution based on a few given real anomalies and inject the learned knowledge into an embedding. In the second stage, we use the embedding and given bounding boxes to guide the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies on specific objects (or textures). In the final stage, we propose a weakly-supervised anomaly detection method to train a more powerful model with generated anomalies. Our method builds upon DRAEM and DesTSeg as the foundation model and conducts experiments on the commonly used industrial anomaly detection dataset, MVTec. The experiments demonstrate that our generated anomalies effectively improve the model performance of both anomaly classification and segmentation tasks simultaneously, \eg, DRAEM and DseTSeg achieved a 5.8\% and 1.5\% improvement in AU-PR metric on segmentation task, respectively.

| **[InvDesFlow-AL: Active Learning-based Workflow for Inverse Design of Functional Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09203v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing inverse design methods for functional materials with specific properties is critical to advancing fields like renewable energy, catalysis, energy storage, and carbon capture. Generative models based on diffusion principles can directly produce new materials that meet performance constraints, thereby significantly accelerating the material design process. However, existing methods for generating and predicting crystal structures often remain limited by low success rates. In this work, we propose a novel inverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is based on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize the material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired performance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the InvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 {\AA}, representing an 32.96% improvement in performance compared to exsisting generative models. Additionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of low-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate materials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously expanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative model in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove the effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors under ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL. As a result, we successfully identified Li\(_2\)AuH\(_6\) as a conventional BCS superconductor with an ultra-high transition temperature of 140 K. This discovery provides strong empirical support for the application of inverse design in materials science.</p></details> | 29 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Generalizing imaging biomarker repeatability studies using Bayesian inference: Applications in detecting heterogeneous treatment response in whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI of metastatic prostate cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09197v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The assessment of imaging biomarkers is critical for advancing precision medicine and improving disease characterization. Despite the availability of methods to derive disease heterogeneity metrics in imaging studies, a robust framework for evaluating measurement uncertainty remains underdeveloped. To address this gap, we propose a novel Bayesian framework to assess the precision of disease heterogeneity measures in biomarker studies. Our approach extends traditional methods for evaluating biomarker precision by providing greater flexibility in statistical assumptions and enabling the analysis of biomarkers beyond univariate or multivariate normally-distributed variables. Using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, the framework supports both, for example, normally-distributed and Dirichlet-Multinomial distributed variables, enabling the derivation of posterior distributions for biomarker parameters under diverse model assumptions. Designed to be broadly applicable across various imaging modalities and biomarker types, the framework builds a foundation for generalizing reproducible and objective biomarker evaluation. To demonstrate utility, we apply the framework to whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI (WBDWI) to assess heterogeneous therapeutic responses in metastatic bone disease. Specifically, we analyze data from two patient studies investigating treatments for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Our results reveal an approximately 70% response rate among individual tumors across both studies, objectively characterizing differential responses to systemic therapies and validating the clinical relevance of the proposed methodology. This Bayesian framework provides a powerful tool for advancing biomarker research across diverse imaging-based studies while offering valuable insights into specific clinical applications, such as mCRPC treatment response.</p></details> |  |

We present Adversarial Relativistic-Contrastive (ARC) post-training, the first adversarial acceleration algorithm for diffusion/flow models not based on distillation. While past adversarial post-training methods have struggled to compare against their expensive distillation counterparts, ARC post-training is a simple procedure that (1) extends a recent relativistic adversarial formulation to diffusion/flow post-training and (2) combines it with a novel contrastive discriminator objective to encourage better prompt adherence. We pair ARC post-training with a number optimizations to Stable Audio Open and build a model capable of generating $\approx$12s of 44.1kHz stereo audio in $\approx$75ms on an H100, and $\approx$7s on a mobile edge-device, the fastest text-to-audio model to our knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[HCMA: Hierarchical Cross-model Alignment for Grounded Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06512v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image synthesis has progressed to the point where models can generate visually compelling images from natural language prompts. Yet, existing methods often fail to reconcile high-level semantic fidelity with explicit spatial control, particularly in scenes involving multiple objects, nuanced relations, or complex layouts. To bridge this gap, we propose a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Alignment (HCMA) framework for grounded text-to-image generation. HCMA integrates two alignment modules into each diffusion sampling step: a global module that continuously aligns latent representations with textual descriptions to ensure scene-level coherence, and a local module that employs bounding-box layouts to anchor objects at specified locations, enabling fine-grained spatial control. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO 2014 validation set show that HCMA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 0.69 improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and a 0.0295 gain in CLIP Score. These results demonstrate HCMA's effectiveness in faithfully capturing intricate textual semantics while adhering to user-defined spatial constraints, offering a robust solution for semantically grounded image generation.Our code is available at https://github.com/hwang-cs-ime/HCMA</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Latent Theory of Mind: A Decentralized Diffusion Architecture for Cooperative Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09144v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Latent Theory of Mind (LatentToM), a decentralized diffusion policy architecture for collaborative robot manipulation. Our policy allows multiple manipulators with their own perception and computation to collaborate with each other towards a common task goal with or without explicit communication. Our key innovation lies in allowing each agent to maintain two latent representations: an ego embedding specific to the robot, and a consensus embedding trained to be common to both robots, despite their different sensor streams and poses. We further let each robot train a decoder to infer the other robot's ego embedding from their consensus embedding, akin to theory of mind in latent space. Training occurs centrally, with all the policies' consensus encoders supervised by a loss inspired by sheaf theory, a mathematical theory for clustering data on a topological manifold. Specifically, we introduce a first-order cohomology loss to enforce sheaf-consistent alignment of the consensus embeddings. To preserve the expressiveness of the consensus embedding, we further propose structural constraints based on theory of mind and a directional consensus mechanism. Execution can be fully distributed, requiring no explicit communication between policies. In which case, the information is exchanged implicitly through each robot's sensor stream by observing the actions of the other robots and their effects on the scene. Alternatively, execution can leverage direct communication to share the robots' consensus embeddings, where the embeddings are shared once during each inference step and are aligned using the sheaf Laplacian. In our hardware experiments, LatentToM outperforms a naive decentralized diffusion baseline, and shows comparable performance with a state-of-the-art centralized diffusion policy for bi-manual manipulation.

However, existing methods primarily focus on local feature extraction while overlooking global topological information, such as voids, which are crucial for maintaining shape consistency and capturing complex geometries. To address this limitation, we propose TopoDiT-3D, a Topology-Aware Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck structure for 3D point cloud generation. Specifically, we design the bottleneck structure utilizing Perceiver Resampler, which not only offers a mode to integrate topological information extracted through persistent homology into feature learning, but also adaptively filters out redundant local features to improve training efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TopoDiT-3D outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual quality, diversity, and training efficiency. Furthermore, TopoDiT-3D demonstrates the importance of rich topological information for 3D point cloud generation and its synergy with conventional local feature learning.

It has led to the release of popular black-box tools (e.g., APIs) for users to upload personal data and receive protected counterparts. In this work, we show that such black-box protections can be substantially compromised if a small set of unprotected in-distribution data is available. Specifically, we propose a novel threat model of protection leakage, where an adversary can (1) easily acquire (unprotected, protected) pairs by querying the black-box protections with a small unprotected dataset; and (2) train a diffusion bridge model to build a mapping between unprotected and protected data. This mapping, termed BridgePure, can effectively remove the protection from any previously unseen data within the same distribution. BridgePure demonstrates superior purification performance on classification and style mimicry tasks, exposing critical vulnerabilities in black-box data protection. We suggest that practitioners implement multi-level countermeasures to mitigate such risks.</p></details> | 29 pages,18 figures |

We propose a diffusion factor model that integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes, bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4} n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable for markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior performance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical analysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in constructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work presents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion models, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial simulation with limited data.

| **[Generating time-consistent dynamics with discriminator-guided image diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09089v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic temporal dynamics are crucial for many video generation, processing and modelling applications, e.g. in computational fluid dynamics, weather prediction, or long-term climate simulations. Video diffusion models (VDMs) are the current state-of-the-art method for generating highly realistic dynamics. However, training VDMs from scratch can be challenging and requires large computational resources, limiting their wider application. Here, we propose a time-consistency discriminator that enables pretrained image diffusion models to generate realistic spatiotemporal dynamics. The discriminator guides the sampling inference process and does not require extensions or finetuning of the image diffusion model. We compare our approach against a VDM trained from scratch on an idealized turbulence simulation and a real-world global precipitation dataset. Our approach performs equally well in terms of temporal consistency, shows improved uncertainty calibration and lower biases compared to the VDM, and achieves stable centennial-scale climate simulations at daily time steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-shot prediction of parametric partial differential equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09063v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Flexi-VAE, a data-driven framework for efficient single-shot forecasting of nonlinear parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), eliminating the need for iterative time-stepping while maintaining high accuracy and stability. Flexi-VAE incorporates a neural propagator that advances latent representations forward in time, aligning latent evolution with physical state reconstruction in a variational autoencoder setting. We evaluate two propagation strategies, the Direct Concatenation Propagator (DCP) and the Positional Encoding Propagator (PEP), and demonstrate, through representation-theoretic analysis, that DCP offers superior long-term generalization by fostering disentangled and physically meaningful latent spaces. Geometric diagnostics, including Jacobian spectral analysis, reveal that propagated latent states reside in regions of lower decoder sensitivity and more stable local geometry than those derived via direct encoding, enhancing robustness for long-horizon predictions. We validate Flexi-VAE on canonical PDE benchmarks, the 1D viscous Burgers equation and the 2D advection-diffusion equation, achieving accurate forecasts across wide parametric ranges. The model delivers over 50x CPU and 90x GPU speedups compared to autoencoder-LSTM baselines for large temporal shifts. These results position Flexi-VAE as a scalable and interpretable surrogate modeling tool for accelerating high-fidelity simulations in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and other parametric PDE-driven applications, with extensibility to higher-dimensional and more complex systems.</p></details> | 35 pages, 17 figures |

Core technologies include: (i) a weakly-supervised Residual U-Net model generating a skeleton probability map to isolate bone; (ii) a statistical framework for WB-DWI intensity normalisation, obtaining a signal-normalised b=900s/mm^2 (b900) image; and (iii) a shallow convolutional neural network that processes outputs from (i) and (ii) to generate a mask of suspected bone lesions, characterised by higher b900 signal intensity due to restricted water diffusion. This mask is applied to the gADC map to extract TDV and gADC statistics. We tested the tool using expert-defined metastatic bone disease delineations on 66 datasets, assessed repeatability of imaging biomarkers (N=10), and compared software-based response assessment with a construct reference standard based on clinical, laboratory and imaging assessments (N=118). Dice score between manual and automated delineations was 0.6 for lesions within pelvis and spine, with an average surface distance of 2mm. Relative differences for log-transformed TDV (log-TDV) and median gADC were below 9% and 5%, respectively. Repeatability analysis showed coefficients of variation of 4.57% for log-TDV and 3.54% for median gADC, with intraclass correlation coefficients above 0.9. The software achieved 80.5% accuracy, 84.3% sensitivity, and 85.7% specificity in assessing response to treatment compared to the construct reference standard. Computation time generating a mask averaged 90 seconds per scan. Our software enables reproducible TDV and gADC quantification from WB-DWI scans for monitoring metastatic bone disease response, thus providing potentially useful measurements for clinical decision-making in APC patients.</p></details> |  |

Deformability, anatomical variance, and strict hygiene rules make conventional suction and scripted motions unreliable. We present ChicGrasp, an end--to--end hardware--software co-design for this task. An independently actuated dual-jaw pneumatic gripper clamps both chicken legs, while a conditional diffusion-policy controller, trained from only 50 multi--view teleoperation demonstrations (RGB + proprioception), plans 5 DoF end--effector motion, which includes jaw commands in one shot. On individually presented raw broiler carcasses, our system achieves a 40.6\% grasp--and--lift success rate and completes the pick to shackle cycle in 38 s, whereas state--of--the--art implicit behaviour cloning (IBC) and LSTM-GMM baselines fail entirely. All CAD, code, and datasets will be open-source.

In this paper, we present a manifold-based formulation of the glint normal distribution functions (NDF) that precisely captures the surface normal distributions over queried footprints. The manifold-based formulation transfers the integration for the glint NDF construction to a problem of mesh intersections. Compared to previous works that rely on complex numerical approximations, our integral solution is exact and much simpler to compute, which also allows an easy adaptation of a mesh clustering hierarchy to accelerate the NDF evaluation of large footprints. Our performance and quality analysis shows that our NDF formulation achieves similar glinty appearance compared to the baselines but is an order of magnitude faster. Within this framework, we further present a novel derivation of analytical shadow-masking for normal-mapped diffuse surfaces -- a component that is often ignored in previous works.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Social Bias Audit of Contrastive Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13223v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of text-to-image generative models, biases inherent in training datasets often propagate into generated content, posing significant ethical challenges, particularly in socially sensitive contexts. We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in text-to-image models through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models. FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero-shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems--including DALL-E and various Stable Diffusion variants--demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI-driven content generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[On a Modified Random Genetic Drift Model: Derivation and a Structure-Preserving Operator-Splitting Discretization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08969v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the fundamental mathematical models for studying random genetic drift is the Kimura equation, derived as the large-population limit of the discrete Wright-Fisher model. However, due to the degeneracy of the diffusion coefficient, it is impossible to impose a suitable boundary condition that ensures the Kimura equation admits a classical solution while preserving biological significance. In this work, we propose a modified model for random genetic drift that admits classical solutions by modifying the domain of the Kimura equation from $(0, 1)$ to $(\delta, 1 - \delta)$ with $\delta$ being a small parameter, which allows us to impose a Robin-type boundary condition. By introducing two additional variables for the probabilities in the boundary region, we effectively capture the conservation of mass and the fixation dynamics in the original model. To numerically investigate the modified model, we develop a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian operator splitting scheme. The scheme first solves the flow map equation in the bulk region using a Lagrangian approach with a no-flux boundary condition, followed by handling the boundary dynamics in Eulerian coordinates. This hybrid scheme ensures mass conservation, maintains positivity, and preserves the first moment. Various numerical tests demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and structure-preserving properties of the proposed scheme. Numerical results demonstrate the key qualitative features of the original Kimura equation, including the fixation behavior and the correct stationary distribution in the small-$\delta$ limit.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to one-size-fits-all approaches that seek to mitigate risk at the population level, digital twins enable personalized modeling thereby potentially improving individual patient outcomes. Realizing digital twins in biomedicine requires scalable and efficient methods to integrate patient data with mechanistic models of disease progression. This study develops an end-to-end data-to-decisions methodology that combines longitudinal non-invasive imaging data with mechanistic models to estimate and predict spatiotemporal tumor progression accounting for patient-specific anatomy. Through the solution of a statistical inverse problem, imaging data inform the spatially varying parameters of a reaction-diffusion model of tumor progression. An efficient parallel implementation of the forward model coupled with a scalable approximation of the Bayesian posterior distribution enables rigorous, but tractable, quantification of uncertainty due to the sparse, noisy measurements. The methodology is verified on a virtual patient with synthetic data to control for model inadequacy, noise level, and the frequency of data collection. The application to decision-making is illustrated by evaluating the importance of imaging frequency and formulating an optimal experimental design question. The clinical relevance is demonstrated through a model validation study on a cohort of patients with publicly available longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually-crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We systematically evaluate our method on simulation and real-world tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

This revolutionary force offers the most promising path yet toward solving one of engineering's grandest challenges: achieving reliable, fully autonomous driving, particularly the pursuit of Level 5 autonomy. This survey delivers a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the emerging role of GenAI across the autonomous driving stack. We begin by distilling the principles and trade-offs of modern generative modeling, encompassing VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We then map their frontier applications in image, LiDAR, trajectory, occupancy, video generation as well as LLM-guided reasoning and decision making. We categorize practical applications, such as synthetic data workflows, end-to-end driving strategies, high-fidelity digital twin systems, smart transportation networks, and cross-domain transfer to embodied AI. We identify key obstacles and possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases, evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport integration, and socio-technical influence. By unifying these threads, the survey provides a forward-looking reference for researchers, engineers, and policymakers navigating the convergence of generative AI and advanced autonomous mobility.

By expressing parameter-varying operators with affine dependence as contractions of a generalized parameter vector against a constant tensor, this method leverages the operator inference framework to capture parametric dependence in the learned reduced-order model via the solution to a convex, least-squares optimization problem. This leads to a concise and straightforward implementation which compactifies previous parametric operator inference approaches and directly extends to learning parametric operators with symmetry constraints, a key feature required for constructing structure-preserving surrogates of Hamiltonian systems. The proposed approach is demonstrated on both a (non-Hamiltonian) heat equation with variable diffusion coefficient as well as a Hamiltonian wave equation with variable wave speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/sandialabs/HamiltonianOpInf/tree/parametric</p></details> |

Feature caching, which stores and retrieves redundant computations, offers the potential for acceleration. Existing learning-based caching, though adaptive, overlooks the impact of the prior timestep. It also suffers from misaligned objectives--aligned predicted noise vs. high-quality images--between training and inference. These two discrepancies compromise both performance and efficiency. To this end, we harmonize training and inference with a novel learning-based caching framework dubbed HarmoniCa. It first incorporates Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) to ensure the continuity of the denoising process, where prior steps can be leveraged. In addition, an Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO) is applied to balance image quality against cache utilization through an efficient proxy to approximate the image error. Extensive experiments across $8$ models, $4$ samplers, and resolutions from $256\times256$ to $2K$ demonstrate superior performance and speedup of our framework. For instance, it achieves over $40\%$ latency reduction (i.e., $2.07\times$ theoretical speedup) and improved performance on PixArt-$\alpha$. Remarkably, our image-free approach reduces training time by $25\%$ compared with the previous method.

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[No Other Representation Component Is Needed: Diffusion Transformers Can Provide Representation Guidance by Themselves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02831v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that learning a meaningful internal representation can both accelerate generative training and enhance the generation quality of diffusion transformers. However, existing approaches necessitate to either introduce an external and complex representation training framework or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained representation foundation model to provide representation guidance during the original generative training process. In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without requiring external representation components. We therefore propose Self-Representation Alignment (SRA), a simple yet straightforward method that obtains representation guidance through a self-distillation manner. Specifically, SRA aligns the output latent representation of the diffusion transformer in the earlier layer with higher noise to that in the later layer with lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during only the generative training process. Experimental results indicate that applying SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements. Moreover, SRA not only significantly outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary, complex representation training frameworks but also achieves performance comparable to methods that are heavily dependent on powerful external representation priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Self-...</summary><p>Self-Representation Alignment for Diffusion Transformers.

Most previous methods rely on precise localization and mapping or learn from expensive real-world demonstrations. In this paper, we propose the Navigation Diffusion Policy (NavDP), an end-to-end framework trained solely in simulation and can zero-shot transfer to different embodiments in diverse real-world environments. The key ingredient of NavDP's network is the combination of diffusion-based trajectory generation and a critic function for trajectory selection, which are conditioned on only local observation tokens encoded from a shared policy transformer. Given the privileged information of the global environment in simulation, we scale up the demonstrations of good quality to train the diffusion policy and formulate the critic value function targets with contrastive negative samples. Our demonstration generation approach achieves about 2,500 trajectories/GPU per day, 20$\times$ more efficient than real-world data collection, and results in a large-scale navigation dataset with 363.2km trajectories across 1244 scenes. Trained with this simulation dataset, NavDP achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outstanding generalization capability on quadruped, wheeled, and humanoid robots in diverse indoor and outdoor environments. In addition, we present a preliminary attempt at using Gaussian Splatting to make in-domain real-to-sim fine-tuning to further bridge the sim-to-real gap. Experiments show that adding such real-to-sim data can improve the success rate by 30\% without hurting its generalization capability.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

The maturation of diffusion models has further advanced the development of image colorization models. However, current mainstream image colorization models still face issues such as color bleeding and color binding errors, and cannot colorize images at the instance level. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based colorization method MT-Color to achieve precise instance-aware colorization with use-provided guidance. To tackle color bleeding issue, we design a pixel-level mask attention mechanism that integrates latent features and conditional gray image features through cross-attention. We use segmentation masks to construct cross-attention masks, preventing pixel information from exchanging between different instances. We also introduce an instance mask and text guidance module that extracts instance masks and text representations of each instance, which are then fused with latent features through self-attention, utilizing instance masks to form self-attention masks to prevent instance texts from guiding the colorization of other areas, thus mitigating color binding errors. Furthermore, we apply a multi-instance sampling strategy, which involves sampling each instance region separately and then fusing the results. Additionally, we have created a specialized dataset for instance-level colorization tasks, GPT-color, by leveraging large visual language models on existing image datasets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our model and dataset outperform previous methods and datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel calibration-free visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene without requiring additional training. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on several tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo and OpenVLA. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

However, crafting effective textual prompts to guide these models remains challenging, often requiring extensive trial and error. Existing prompt inversion approaches, such as soft and hard prompt techniques, are not so effective due to the limited interpretability and incoherent prompt generation. To address these issues, we propose Visually Guided Decoding (VGD), a gradient-free approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and CLIP-based guidance to generate coherent and semantically aligned prompts. In essence, VGD utilizes the robust text generation capabilities of LLMs to produce human-readable prompts. Further, by employing CLIP scores to ensure alignment with user-specified visual concepts, VGD enhances the interpretability, generalization, and flexibility of prompt generation without the need for additional training. Our experiments demonstrate that VGD outperforms existing prompt inversion techniques in generating understandable and contextually relevant prompts, facilitating more intuitive and controllable interactions with text-to-image models.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

The scarcity of labeled data and domain gaps between synthetic and real-world images also pose notable challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, \textbf{BooSTer}, that leverages both vision foundation models and large-scale mixed image sources, including synthetic, real, and single-view images. First, to fully unleash the potential of large-scale single-view images, we design a data generation strategy combining monocular depth estimation and diffusion models to generate dense stereo matching data from single-view images. Second, to tackle sparse labels in real-world datasets, we transfer knowledge from monocular depth estimation models, using pseudo-mono depth labels and a dynamic scale- and shift-invariant loss for additional supervision. Furthermore, we incorporate vision foundation model as an encoder to extract robust and transferable features, boosting accuracy and generalization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving significant improvements in accuracy over existing methods, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data and domain shifts.</p></details> |  |

Investigating Gender Disambiguation and Attention in Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08546v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While gender bias in modern Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems has received much attention, traditional evaluation metrics do not to fully capture the extent to which these systems integrate contextual gender cues. We propose a novel evaluation metric called Minimal Pair Accuracy (MPA), which measures the reliance of models on gender cues for gender disambiguation. MPA is designed to go beyond surface-level gender accuracy metrics by focusing on whether models adapt to gender cues in minimal pairs -- sentence pairs that differ solely in the gendered pronoun, namely the explicit indicator of the target's entity gender in the source language (EN). We evaluate a number of NMT models on the English-Italian (EN--IT) language pair using this metric, we show that they ignore available gender cues in most cases in favor of (statistical) stereotypical gender interpretation. We further show that in anti-stereotypical cases, these models tend to more consistently take masculine gender cues into account while ignoring the feminine cues. Furthermore, we analyze the attention head weights in the encoder component and show that while all models encode gender information to some extent, masculine cues elicit a more diffused response compared to the more concentrated and specialized responses to feminine gender cues.</p></details> |  |

The framework incorporates a diffusion model tailored for time series generation to enhance the accuracy of the load forecasting module used in the system operation. In the absence of explicit state transition law, a model-identification procedure is leveraged to derive the system dynamics, thereby eliminating a barrier when applying MPC to a renewables-dominated power system. Case study results on an industry park system and the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that using the diffusion model to augment the training dataset significantly improves load-forecasting accuracy, and the inferred system dynamics are applicable to the real-time grid operation with solar and wind.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by the 2025 IEEE PES General Meeting (PESGM) which will be held in Austin, TX, July.27-31, 2005</p></details> |
| **[Building-Block Aware Generative Modeling for 3D Crystals of Metal Organic Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08531v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) marry inorganic nodes, organic edges, and topological nets into programmable porous crystals, yet their astronomical design space defies brute-force synthesis. Generative modeling holds ultimate promise, but existing models either recycle known building blocks or are restricted to small unit cells. We introduce Building-Block-Aware MOF Diffusion (BBA MOF Diffusion), an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that learns 3D all-atom representations of individual building blocks, encoding crystallographic topological nets explicitly. Trained on the CoRE-MOF database, BBA MOF Diffusion readily samples MOFs with unit cells containing 1000 atoms with great geometric validity, novelty, and diversity mirroring experimental databases. Its native building-block representation produces unprecedented metal nodes and organic edges, expanding accessible chemical space by orders of magnitude. One high-scoring [Zn(1,4-TDC)(EtOH)2] MOF predicted by the model was synthesized, where powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and N2 sorption confirm its structural fidelity. BBA-Diff thus furnishes a practical pathway to synthesizable and high-performing MOFs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized View and Geometry Distillation from Multi-view Diffuser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06198v4)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating multi-view images from a single input view using image-conditioned diffusion models is a recent advancement and has shown considerable potential. However, issues such as the lack of consistency in synthesized views and over-smoothing in extracted geometry persist. Previous methods integrate multi-view consistency modules or impose additional supervisory to enhance view consistency while compromising on the flexibility of camera positioning and limiting the versatility of view synthesis. In this study, we consider the radiance field optimized during geometry extraction as a more rigid consistency prior, compared to volume and ray aggregation used in previous works. We further identify and rectify a critical bias in the traditional radiance field optimization process through score distillation from a multi-view diffuser. We introduce an Unbiased Score Distillation (USD) that utilizes unconditioned noises from a 2D diffusion model, greatly refining the radiance field fidelity. We leverage the rendered views from the optimized radiance field as the basis and develop a two-step specialization process of a 2D diffusion model, which is adept at conducting object-specific denoising and generating high-quality multi-view images. Finally, we recover faithful geometry and texture directly from the refined multi-view images. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our optimized geometry and view distillation technique generates comparable results to the state-of-the-art models trained on extensive datasets, all while maintaining freedom in camera positioning.

One effective solution involves watermarking the generated images. Existing methods primarily focus on ensuring that watermark embedding does not degrade the model performance. However, they often overlook critical challenges in real-world deployment scenarios, such as the complexity of watermark key management, user-defined generation parameters, and the difficulty of verification by arbitrary third parties. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Shading++, a diffusion model watermarking method tailored for real-world deployment. We propose a double-channel design that leverages pseudorandom error-correcting codes to encode the random seed required for watermark pseudorandomization, achieving performance-lossless watermarking under a fixed watermark key and overcoming key management challenges. Additionally, we model the distortions introduced during generation and inversion as an additive white Gaussian noise channel and employ a novel soft decision decoding strategy during extraction, ensuring strong robustness even when generation parameters vary. To enable third-party verification, we incorporate public key signatures, which provide a certain level of resistance against forgery attacks even when model inversion capabilities are fully disclosed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Shading++ not only maintains performance losslessness but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness, making it a more practical solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

Despite the effectiveness of the propagation mechanism, they might encounter blurry and inconsistencies when dealing with inaccurate optical flows or large masks. Recently, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a revolutionary technique for video generation tasks. However, pretrained DiT models for video generation all contain a large amount of parameters, which makes it very time consuming to apply to video inpainting tasks. In this paper, we present DiTPainter, an end-to-end video inpainting model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiTPainter uses an efficient transformer network designed for video inpainting, which is trained from scratch instead of initializing from any large pretrained models. DiTPainter can address videos with arbitrary lengths and can be applied to video decaptioning and video completion tasks with an acceptable time cost. Experiments show that DiTPainter outperforms existing video inpainting algorithms with higher quality and better spatial-temporal consistency.</p></details> |  |

To obtain the subgoals, existing methods typically resort to video generation models but suffer from model hallucination and computational cost. We present Vis2Plan, an efficient, explainable and white-box visual planning framework powered by symbolic guidance. From raw, unlabeled play data, Vis2Plan harnesses vision foundation models to automatically extract a compact set of task symbols, which allows building a high-level symbolic transition graph for multi-goal, multi-stage planning. At test time, given a desired task goal, our planner conducts planning at the symbolic level and assembles a sequence of physically consistent intermediate sub-goal images grounded by the underlying symbolic representation. Our Vis2Plan outperforms strong diffusion video generation-based visual planners by delivering 53\% higher aggregate success rate in real robot settings while generating visual plans 35$\times$ faster. The results indicate that Vis2Plan is able to generate physically consistent image goals while offering fully inspectable reasoning steps.</p></details> |  |

However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA. We believe that \methodname offers an interesting perspective on utilizing pre-trained multimodal models for policy learning.

However, when it comes to human body forgery, there has been a persistent lack of datasets and detection methods, due to the later inception and complexity of human body generation methods. To mitigate this issue, we introduce TikTok-DeepFake (TT-DF), a novel large-scale diffusion-based dataset containing 6,120 forged videos with 1,378,857 synthetic frames, specifically tailored for body forgery detection. TT-DF offers a wide variety of forgery methods, involving multiple advanced human image animation models utilized for manipulation, two generative configurations based on the disentanglement of identity and pose information, as well as different compressed versions. The aim is to simulate any potential unseen forged data in the wild as comprehensively as possible, and we also furnish a benchmark on TT-DF. Additionally, we propose an adapted body forgery detection model, Temporal Optical Flow Network (TOF-Net), which exploits the spatiotemporal inconsistencies and optical flow distribution differences between natural data and forged data. Our experiments demonstrate that TOF-Net achieves favorable performance on TT-DF, outperforming current state-of-the-art extendable facial forgery detection models.

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The webpage is at https://dex-vla.github.io/</p></details> |

This approach effectively captures complex dependencies and multi-modalities within posteriors. ConDiSim is evaluated across ten benchmark problems and two real-world test problems, where it demonstrates effective posterior approximation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and stability in model training.

| **[A Fourier finite volume approach for the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08400v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new approach for solving the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography is introduced, which interpolates between the well-known diffusion approximation and a radiative transfer equation based model. The proposed formulation combines a spatial finite volume scheme with a truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable for the radiative transfer equation. The finite volume scheme provides a natural and simple approach for representing piecewise constant image data modelled using transport equations. The truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable facilitates the interpolation between the diffusion approximation at low order, and the full radiative transfer model as the truncation limit $N\rightarrow\infty$. It is therefore possible to tune the precision of the model to the demands of the imaging application, taking $N=1$ for cases when the diffusion approximation would suffice and increasing the number of terms otherwise. We will then utilise the non-linear optimisation functionality of Matlab to address the corresponding large-scale nonlinear inverse problem using gradient based quasi-Newton minimisation via the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Numerical experiments for two test-cases of increasing complexity and resolution will be presented, and the effect of logarithmically rescaling the problem data on the accuracy of the reconstructed solutions will be investigated. We will focus on cases where the diffusion approximation is not sufficient to demonstrate that our approach can provide significant accuracy gains with only a modest increase in the number of Fourier terms included.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Central to our approach is a next-token prediction objective, enabling the model to reason effectively over the user's query in the context of current observations. Subsequently, a diffusion model is attached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through self-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates reasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole framework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the effectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting task, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not seen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model interpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and identify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test DiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7\% accuracy on 102 previously unseen objects. Our method demonstrates robustness to visual changes, such as distractors and new backgrounds, and easily adapts to new embodiments. Furthermore, DiffusionVLA can follow novel instructions and retain conversational ability. Notably, DiffusionVLA is data-efficient and fast at inference; our smallest DiffusionVLA-2B runs 82Hz on a single A6000 GPU and can train from scratch on less than 50 demonstrations for a complex task. Finally, we scale the model from 2B to 72B parameters, showcasing improved generalization capabilities with increased model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is available at: http://diffusion-vla.github.io</p></details> |

We trace the failure to loose coupling between high-level (HL) sub-goal selection and low-level (LL) trajectory generation, which leads to incoherent plans and degraded performance. We propose Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion (CHD), a framework that models HL sub-goals and LL trajectories jointly within a unified diffusion process. A shared classifier passes LL feedback upstream so that sub-goals self-correct while sampling proceeds. This tight HL-LL coupling improves trajectory coherence and enables scalable long-horizon diffusion planning. Experiments across maze navigation, tabletop manipulation, and household environments show that CHD consistently outperforms both flat and hierarchical diffusion baselines.

| **[Adaptive Diffusion Policy Optimization for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08376v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown the great potential of diffusion models in improving reinforcement learning (RL) by modeling complex policies, expressing a high degree of multi-modality, and efficiently handling high-dimensional continuous control tasks. However, there is currently limited research on how to optimize diffusion-based polices (e.g., Diffusion Policy) fast and stably. In this paper, we propose an Adam-based Diffusion Policy Optimization (ADPO), a fast algorithmic framework containing best practices for fine-tuning diffusion-based polices in robotic control tasks using the adaptive gradient descent method in RL. Adaptive gradient method is less studied in training RL, let alone diffusion-based policies. We confirm that ADPO outperforms other diffusion-based RL methods in terms of overall effectiveness for fine-tuning on standard robotic tasks. Concretely, we conduct extensive experiments on standard robotic control tasks to test ADPO, where, particularly, six popular diffusion-based RL methods are provided as benchmark methods. Experimental results show that ADPO acquires better or comparable performance than the baseline methods. Finally, we systematically analyze the sensitivity of multiple hyperparameters in standard robotics tasks, providing guidance for subsequent practical applications.

| **[DPR: Diffusion Preference-based Reward for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01143v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) mitigates the need for reward definition, aligning with human preferences via preference-driven reward feedback without interacting with the environment. However, the effectiveness of preference-driven reward functions depends on the modeling ability of the learning model, which current MLP-based and Transformer-based methods may fail to adequately provide. To alleviate the failure of the reward function caused by insufficient modeling, we propose a novel preference-based reward acquisition method: Diffusion Preference-based Reward (DPR). Unlike previous methods using Bradley-Terry models for trajectory preferences, we use diffusion models to directly model preference distributions for state-action pairs, allowing rewards to be discriminatively obtained from these distributions. In addition, considering the particularity of preference data that only know the internal relationships of paired trajectories, we further propose Conditional Diffusion Preference-based Reward (C-DPR), which leverages relative preference information to enhance the construction of the diffusion model. We apply the above methods to existing offline reinforcement learning algorithms and a series of experiment results demonstrate that the diffusion-based reward acquisition approach outperforms previous MLP-based and Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, existing diffusion models predominantly concentrate on modeling static 3D scenes or object-level dynamics, constraining their capacity to provide truly immersive experiences. To address this issue, we propose HoloTime, a framework that integrates video diffusion models to generate panoramic videos from a single prompt or reference image, along with a 360-degree 4D scene reconstruction method that seamlessly transforms the generated panoramic video into 4D assets, enabling a fully immersive 4D experience for users. Specifically, to tame video diffusion models for generating high-fidelity panoramic videos, we introduce the 360World dataset, the first comprehensive collection of panoramic videos suitable for downstream 4D scene reconstruction tasks. With this curated dataset, we propose Panoramic Animator, a two-stage image-to-video diffusion model that can convert panoramic images into high-quality panoramic videos. Following this, we present Panoramic Space-Time Reconstruction, which leverages a space-time depth estimation method to transform the generated panoramic videos into 4D point clouds, enabling the optimization of a holistic 4D Gaussian Splatting representation to reconstruct spatially and temporally consistent 4D scenes. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conducted a comparative analysis with existing approaches, revealing its superiority in both panoramic video generation and 4D scene reconstruction. This demonstrates our method's capability to create more engaging and realistic immersive environments, thereby enhancing user experiences in VR and AR applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Homepage: https://zhouhyocean.github.io/holotime/ Code: https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/HoloTime</p></details> |
