| **[Accurate and efficient zero-shot 6D pose estimation with frozen foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09784v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable 8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[CHIP: A multi-sensor dataset for 6D pose estimation of chairs in industrial settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09699v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D pose estimation of complex objects in 3D environments is essential for effective robotic manipulation. Yet, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating 6D pose estimation methods under realistic industrial conditions, as most datasets focus on household objects in domestic settings, while the few available industrial datasets are limited to artificial setups with objects placed on tables. To bridge this gap, we introduce CHIP, the first dataset designed for 6D pose estimation of chairs manipulated by a robotic arm in a real-world industrial environment. CHIP includes seven distinct chairs captured using three different RGBD sensing technologies and presents unique challenges, such as distractor objects with fine-grained differences and severe occlusions caused by the robotic arm and human operators. CHIP comprises 77,811 RGBD images annotated with ground-truth 6D poses automatically derived from the robot's kinematics, averaging 11,115 annotations per chair. We benchmark CHIP using three zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods, assessing performance across different sensor types, localization priors, and occlusion levels. Results show substantial room for improvement, highlighting the unique challenges posed by the dataset. CHIP will be publicly released.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[UA-Pose: Uncertainty-Aware 6D Object Pose Estimation and Online Object Completion with Partial References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07996v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects. However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed 3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating 6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are incomplete or partially captured.

| **[You Only Estimate Once: Unified, One-stage, Real-Time Category-level Articulated Object 6D Pose Estimation for Robotic Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05719v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[MTevent: A Multi-Task Event Camera Dataset for 6D Pose Estimation and Moving Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11282v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots are reaching unprecedented speeds, with platforms like Unitree B2, and Fraunhofer O3dyn achieving maximum speeds between 5 and 10 m/s. However, effectively utilizing such speeds remains a challenge due to the limitations of RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and fail to provide real-time responsiveness. Event cameras, with their asynchronous operation, and low-latency sensing, offer a promising alternative for high-speed robotic perception. In this work, we introduce MTevent, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation and moving object detection in highly dynamic environments with large detection distances. Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an RGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16 unique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles, varying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine high-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions, making it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To establish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's FoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with ground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in such dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve perception models and foster further research in high-speed robotic vision. The dataset is available for download https://huggingface.co/datasets/anas-gouda/MTevent</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW); Fifth International Workshop on Event-Based Vision</p></details> |
| **[XYZ-IBD: High-precision Bin-picking Dataset for Object 6D Pose Estimation Capturing Real-world Industrial Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00599v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce XYZ-IBD, a bin-picking dataset for 6D pose estimation that captures real-world industrial complexity, including challenging object geometries, reflective materials, severe occlusions, and dense clutter. The dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on household objects, which approach saturation,XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved realistic industrial conditions. The dataset features 15 texture-less, metallic, and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density, replicating the challenges of real-world bin-picking. XYZ-IBD was collected using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view real-world scenes, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks. By capturing the complexity of real-world bin-picking scenarios, XYZ-IBD introduces more realistic and challenging problems for future research. The dataset and benchmark are publicly available at https://xyz-ibd.github.io/XYZ-IBD/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation in Agricultural Settings Using a Lattice-Deformation Framework and Diffusion-Augmented Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24636v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D object pose estimation is essential for robotic grasping and manipulation, particularly in agriculture, where fruits and vegetables exhibit high intra-class variability in shape, size, and texture. The vast majority of existing methods rely on instance-specific CAD models or require depth sensors to resolve geometric ambiguities, making them impractical for real-world agricultural applications. In this work, we introduce PLANTPose, a novel framework for category-level 6D pose estimation that operates purely on RGB input. PLANTPose predicts both the 6D pose and deformation parameters relative to a base mesh, allowing a single category-level CAD model to adapt to unseen instances. This enables accurate pose estimation across varying shapes without relying on instance-specific data. To enhance realism and improve generalization, we also leverage Stable Diffusion to refine synthetic training images with realistic texturing, mimicking variations due to ripeness and environmental factors and bridging the domain gap between synthetic data and the real world. Our evaluations on a challenging benchmark that includes bananas of various shapes, sizes, and ripeness status demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in handling large intraclass variations while maintaining accurate 6D pose predictions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art RGB-based approach MegaPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

| **[RefPose: Leveraging Reference Geometric Correspondences for Accurate 6D Pose Estimation of Unseen Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10841v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of unseen objects from monocular RGB images remains a challenging problem, especially due to the lack of prior object-specific knowledge. To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to object pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric correspondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using object templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric correspondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage, RefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the generated references and iteratively refines the pose through a render-and-compare approach. To enhance this estimation, we introduce a correlation volume-guided attention mechanism that effectively captures correlations between the query and reference images. Unlike traditional methods that depend on pre-defined object models, RefPose dynamically adapts to new object shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence. This results in robust performance across previously unseen objects. Extensive evaluation on the BOP benchmark datasets shows that RefPose achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining a competitive runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[One2Any: One-Reference 6D Pose Estimation for Any Object](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04109v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation remains challenging for many applications due to dependencies on complete 3D models, multi-view images, or training limited to specific object categories. These requirements make generalization to novel objects difficult for which neither 3D models nor multi-view images may be available. To address this, we propose a novel method One2Any that estimates the relative 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) object pose using only a single reference-single query RGB-D image, without prior knowledge of its 3D model, multi-view data, or category constraints. We treat object pose estimation as an encoding-decoding process, first, we obtain a comprehensive Reference Object Pose Embedding (ROPE) that encodes an object shape, orientation, and texture from a single reference view. Using this embedding, a U-Net-based pose decoding module produces Reference Object Coordinate (ROC) for new views, enabling fast and accurate pose estimation. This simple encoding-decoding framework allows our model to be trained on any pair-wise pose data, enabling large-scale training and demonstrating great scalability. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model generalizes well to novel objects, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness even rivaling methods that require multi-view or CAD inputs, at a fraction of compute.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Category-Level and Open-Set Object Pose Estimation for Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19572v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation enables a variety of tasks in computer vision and robotics, including scene understanding and robotic grasping. The complexity of a pose estimation task depends on the unknown variables related to the target object. While instance-level methods already excel for opaque and Lambertian objects, category-level and open-set methods, where texture, shape, and size are partially or entirely unknown, still struggle with these basic material properties. Since texture is unknown in these scenarios, it cannot be used for disambiguating object symmetries, another core challenge of 6D object pose estimation. The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of unknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions. This paper compares datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithms for solving 6D pose estimation on the category-level. Based on this comparison, we analyze how to bridge category-level and open-set object pose estimation to reach generalization and provide actionable recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Austrian Robotics Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[CordViP: Correspondence-based Visuomotor Policy for Dexterous Manipulation in Real-World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08449v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving human-level dexterity in robots is a key objective in the field of robotic manipulation. Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have shown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal. However, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems: (1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is significantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and occlusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack crucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations, we propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns correspondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and robot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware point clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand. These point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also incorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in six real-world tasks, surpassing other baselines by a large margin. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness of CordViP to different objects, viewpoints, and scenarios.

| **[BOP Challenge 2024 on Model-Based and Model-Free 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02812v4)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the evaluation methodology, datasets and results of the BOP Challenge 2024, the 6th in a series of public competitions organized to capture the state of the art in 6D object pose estimation and related tasks. In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have similar rankings on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21--29% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still -35% behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023), and the 2D detection stage is consequently the main bottleneck of existing pipelines for 6D localization/detection of unseen objects.

| **[ViTa-Zero: Zero-shot Visuotactile Object 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13179v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object 6D pose estimation is a critical challenge in robotics, particularly for manipulation tasks. While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[SCFlow2: Plug-and-Play Object Pose Refiner with Shape-Constraint Scene Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09160v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SCFlow2, a plug-and-play refinement framework for 6D object pose estimation. Most recent 6D object pose methods rely on refinement to get accurate results. However, most existing refinement methods either suffer from noises in establishing correspondences, or rely on retraining for novel objects. SCFlow2 is based on the SCFlow model designed for refinement with shape constraint, but formulates the additional depth as a regularization in the iteration via 3D scene flow for RGBD frames. The key design of SCFlow2 is an introduction of geometry constraints into the training of recurrent matching network, by combining the rigid-motion embeddings in 3D scene flow and 3D shape prior of the target. We train SCFlow2 on a combination of dataset Objaverse, GSO and ShapeNet, and evaluate on BOP datasets with novel objects. After using our method as a post-processing, most state-of-the-art methods produce significantly better results, without any retraining or fine-tuning.

| **[6DOPE-GS: Online 6D Object Pose Estimation using Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01543v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and accurate object pose estimation is an essential component for modern vision systems in many applications such as Augmented Reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, existing methods often produce physically inconsistent pose estimates, hindering their deployment in real-world scenarios. We introduce PhysPose, a novel approach that integrates physical reasoning into pose estimation through a postprocessing optimization enforcing non-penetration and gravitational constraints. By leveraging scene geometry, PhysPose refines pose estimates to ensure physical plausibility. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the YCB-Video dataset from the BOP benchmark and improves over the state-of-the-art pose estimation methods on the HOPE-Video dataset.

To address this, we propose Vanishing Depth, a self-supervised training approach that extends pretrained RGB encoders to incorporate and align metric depth into their feature embeddings. Based on our novel positional depth encoding, we enable stable depth density and depth distribution invariant feature extraction. We achieve performance improvements and SOTA results across a spectrum of relevant RGBD downstream tasks - without the necessity of finetuning the encoder. Most notably, we achieve 56.05 mIoU on SUN-RGBD segmentation, 88.3 RMSE on Void's depth completion, and 83.8 Top 1 accuracy on NYUv2 scene classification. In 6D-object pose estimation, we outperform our predecessors of DinoV2, EVA-02, and Omnivore and achieve SOTA results for non-finetuned encoders in several related RGBD downstream tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

| **[GDRNPP: A Geometry-guided and Fully Learning-based Object Pose Estimator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12145v5)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D pose estimation of rigid objects is a long-standing and challenging task in computer vision. Recently, the emergence of deep learning reveals the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict reliable 6D poses. Given that direct pose regression networks currently exhibit suboptimal performance, most methods still resort to traditional techniques to varying degrees. For example, top-performing methods often adopt an indirect strategy by first establishing 2D-3D or 3D-3D correspondences followed by applying the RANSAC-based PnP or Kabsch algorithms, and further employing ICP for refinement. Despite the performance enhancement, the integration of traditional techniques makes the networks time-consuming and not end-to-end trainable. Orthogonal to them, this paper introduces a fully learning-based object pose estimator. In this work, we first perform an in-depth investigation of both direct and indirect methods and propose a simple yet effective Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDRN) to learn the 6D pose from monocular images in an end-to-end manner. Afterwards, we introduce a geometry-guided pose refinement module, enhancing pose accuracy when extra depth data is available. Guided by the predicted coordinate map, we build an end-to-end differentiable architecture that establishes robust and accurate 3D-3D correspondences between the observed and rendered RGB-D images to refine the pose. Our enhanced pose estimation pipeline GDRNPP (GDRN Plus Plus) conquered the leaderboard of the BOP Challenge for two consecutive years, becoming the first to surpass all prior methods that relied on traditional techniques in both accuracy and speed.

Recent advancements have expanded this estimation from instance-level to category-level, allowing models to generalize across unseen instances within the same category. However, this generalization is limited by the narrow range of categories covered by existing datasets, such as NOCS, which also tend to overlook common real-world challenges like occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Omni6D, a comprehensive RGBD dataset featuring a wide range of categories and varied backgrounds, elevating the task to a more realistic context. 1) The dataset comprises an extensive spectrum of 166 categories, 4688 instances adjusted to the canonical pose, and over 0.8 million captures, significantly broadening the scope for evaluation. 2) We introduce a symmetry-aware metric and conduct systematic benchmarks of existing algorithms on Omni6D, offering a thorough exploration of new challenges and insights. 3) Additionally, we propose an effective fine-tuning approach that adapts models from previous datasets to our extensive vocabulary setting. We believe this initiative will pave the way for new insights and substantial progress in both the industrial and academic fields, pushing forward the boundaries of general 6D pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 (poster).

| **[LuciBot: Automated Robot Policy Learning from Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09871v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generating training supervision for embodied tasks is crucial, as manual designing is tedious and not scalable. While prior works use large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rewards, these approaches are largely limited to simple tasks with well-defined rewards, such as pick-and-place. This limitation arises because LLMs struggle to interpret complex scenes compressed into text or code due to their restricted input modality, while VLM-based rewards, though better at visual perception, remain limited by their less expressive output modality. To address these challenges, we leverage the imagination capability of general-purpose video generation models. Given an initial simulation frame and a textual task description, the video generation model produces a video demonstrating task completion with correct semantics. We then extract rich supervisory signals from the generated video, including 6D object pose sequences, 2D segmentations, and estimated depth, to facilitate task learning in simulation. Our approach significantly improves supervision quality for complex embodied tasks, enabling large-scale training in simulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal 3D Mesh Reconstruction from Images and Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07190v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation for unseen objects is essential in robotics but traditionally relies on trained models that require large datasets, high computational costs, and struggle to generalize. Zero-shot approaches eliminate the need for training but depend on pre-existing 3D object models, which are often impractical to obtain. To address this, we propose a language-guided few-shot 3D reconstruction method, reconstructing a 3D mesh from few input images. In the proposed pipeline, receives a set of input images and a language query. A combination of GroundingDINO and Segment Anything Model outputs segmented masks from which a sparse point cloud is reconstructed with VGGSfM. Subsequently, the mesh is reconstructed with the Gaussian Splatting method SuGAR. In a final cleaning step, artifacts are removed, resulting in the final 3D mesh of the queried object. We evaluate the method in terms of accuracy and quality of the geometry and texture. Furthermore, we study the impact of imaging conditions such as viewing angle, number of input images, and image overlap on 3D object reconstruction quality, efficiency, and computational scalability.</p></details> | under review |
| **[AxisPose: Model-Free Matching-Free Single-Shot 6D Object Pose Estimation via Axis Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06660v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation, which plays a vital role in robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving, has been of great interest in computer vision. Existing studies either require multi-stage pose regression or rely on 2D-3D feature matching. Though these approaches have shown promising results, they rely heavily on appearance information, requiring complex input (i.e., multi-view reference input, depth, or CAD models) and intricate pipeline (i.e., feature extraction-SfM-2D to 3D matching-PnP). We propose AxisPose, a model-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation, which fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing methods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM and PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by leveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects without reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation Module (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes through a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the gradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain the geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated tri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module (TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose achieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N instances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with great potential for generalization to unseen-object level.</p></details> |  |

Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in the camera coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative camera-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting. Code will be released at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/SinRef-6D.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures (including supplementary material)</p></details> |
| **[Active 6D Pose Estimation for Textureless Objects using Multi-View RGB Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03726v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of textureless objects from RBG images is an important problem in robotics. Due to appearance ambiguities, rotational symmetries, and severe occlusions, single-view based 6D pose estimators are still unable to handle a wide range of objects, motivating research towards multi-view pose estimation and next-best-view prediction that addresses these limitations. In this work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for estimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our approach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a sequential two-step process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency. First, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth ambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify the subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through canonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then introduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera viewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty and enhancing pose accuracy. We evaluate our method on the public ROBI dataset as well as on a transparent object dataset that we created. When evaluated using the same camera viewpoints, our multi-view pose estimation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by leveraging our next-best-view strategy, our method achieves high object pose accuracy with substantially fewer viewpoints than heuristic-based policies.</p></details> |  |

We set out to improve the state-of-the-art by addressing challenges such as reflections and specular highlights in industrial applications. Our novel BOP-compatible dataset, featuring a diverse set of metallic objects (cans, household, and industrial items) under various lighting and background conditions, provides additional geometric and visual cues. We demonstrate that these cues can be effectively leveraged to enhance overall performance. To illustrate the usefulness of the additional features, we improve upon the GDRNPP algorithm by introducing an additional keypoint prediction and material estimator head in order to improve spatial scene understanding. Evaluations on the new dataset show improved accuracy for metallic objects, supporting the hypothesis that additional geometric and visual cues can improve learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Increasing the Task Flexibility of Heavy-Duty Manipulators Using Visual 6D Pose Estimation of Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19169v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in visual 6D pose estimation of objects using deep neural networks have enabled novel ways of vision-based control for heavy-duty robotic applications. In this study, we present a pipeline for the precise tool positioning of heavy-duty, long-reach (HDLR) manipulators using advanced machine vision. A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration to estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI). Based on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with motion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool positioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and control methods prevalent in the industry. The proposed methodology comprises orientation and position alignment based on the visually estimated OOI poses, whereas camera-to-robot calibration is conducted based on motion utilizing visual SLAM. The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from rigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via image-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation, only synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world setting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results demonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2 mm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to increase the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR manipulators.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances improving speed and accuracy in pose estimation, finding a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy poses significant challenges in dynamic environments. Most current algorithms lack scalability in estimation time, especially for diverse datasets, and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are often too slow. This study focuses on developing a fast and scalable set of pose estimators based on GDRNPP to meet or exceed current benchmarks in accuracy and robustness, particularly addressing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off essential in real-time scenarios. We propose the AMIS algorithm to tailor the utilized model according to an application-specific trade-off between inference time and accuracy. We further show the effectiveness of the AMIS-based model choice on four prominent benchmark datasets (LM-O, YCB-V, T-LESS, and ITODD).</p></details> |  |

However, the edges of clear objects have the highest contrast, which leads to stable and prominent features. We propose a novel approach by incorporating edge detection in a pre-processing step for the tasks of object detection and object pose estimation. We conducted experiments to investigate the effect of edge detectors on transparent objects. We examine the performance of the state-of-the-art 6D object pose estimation pipeline GDR-Net and the object detector YOLOX when applying different edge detectors as pre-processing steps (i.e., Canny edge detection with and without color information, and holistically-nested edges (HED)). We evaluate the physically-based rendered dataset Trans6D-32 K of transparent objects with parameters proposed by the BOP Challenge. Our results indicate that applying edge detection as a pre-processing enhances performance for certain objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at First Austrian Symposium on AI, Robotics, and Vision (AIROV 2024)</p></details> |

While existing methods can estimate the precise 6D pose of objects, they heavily rely on curated CAD models or reference images, the preparation of which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, 3D models or reference images may not be available in advance and instant robot reaction is desired. In this work, we propose a novel framework named HIPPo, which eliminates the need for curated CAD models and reference images by harnessing image-to-3D priors from Diffusion Models, enabling model-free zero-shot 6D pose estimation. Specifically, we construct HIPPo Dreamer, a rapid image-to-mesh model built on a multiview Diffusion Model and a 3D reconstruction foundation model. Our HIPPo Dreamer can generate a 3D mesh of any unseen objects from a single glance in just a few seconds. Then, as more observations are acquired, we propose to continuously refine the diffusion prior mesh model by joint optimization of object geometry and appearance. This is achieved by a measurement-guided scheme that gradually replaces the plausible diffusion priors with more reliable online observations. Consequently, HIPPo can instantly estimate and track the 6D pose of a novel object and maintain a complete mesh for immediate robotic applications. Thorough experiments on various benchmarks show that HIPPo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 6D object pose estimation when prior reference images are limited.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often struggle with achieving high accuracy in both object detection and precise pose estimation simultaneously. This study proposes an improved 6D object detection and pose estimation pipeline based on the existing 6D-VNet framework, enhanced by integrating a Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC) and a High-Resolution Network (HRNet) backbone. By leveraging the strengths of HTC's multi-stage refinement process and HRNet's ability to maintain high-resolution representations, our approach significantly improves detection accuracy and pose estimation precision. Furthermore, we introduce advanced post-processing techniques and a novel model integration strategy that collectively contribute to superior performance on public and private benchmarks. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models, making it a valuable contribution to the domain of 6D object detection and pose estimation.</p></details> |  |

Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve ambiguous cases due to geometrically symmetric objects that is based on visual features. We comprehensively evaluate FreeZe across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, which include over a hundred 3D objects and 20,000 images captured in various scenarios. FreeZe consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches, including competitors extensively trained on synthetic 6D pose estimation data.

Traditional methods often rely on deep learning with grid based data structures but struggle to capture complex dependencies among extracted features. To overcome this, we introduce a graph based representation derived directly from images, where spatial temporal features of each pixel serve as nodes, and relationships between them are defined through node connectivity and spatial interactions. We also employ feature selection mechanisms that use spatial attention and self attention distillation, along with a Legendre convolution layer leveraging the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials for numerical stability. Experiments on the LINEMOD, Occluded LINEMOD, and YCB Video datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms nine existing approaches and achieves state of the art benchmark in object pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, they present a major challenge due to their distinct refractive and reflective properties when it comes to accurately estimating the 6D pose. To solve this, we present ReFlow6D, a novel method for transparent object 6D pose estimation that harnesses the refractive-intermediate representation. Unlike conventional approaches, our method leverages a feature space impervious to changes in RGB image space and independent of depth information. Drawing inspiration from image matting, we model the deformation of the light path through transparent objects, yielding a unique object-specific intermediate representation guided by light refraction that is independent of the environment in which objects are observed. By integrating these intermediate features into the pose estimation network, we show that ReFlow6D achieves precise 6D pose estimation of transparent objects, using only RGB images as input. Our method further introduces a novel transparent object compositing loss, fostering the generation of superior refractive-intermediate features. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TOD and Trans32K-6D datasets. Robot grasping experiments further demonstrate that ReFlow6D's pose estimation accuracy effectively translates to real-world robotics task.

| **[Level-Set Parameters: Novel Representation for 3D Shape Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13502v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D shape analysis has been largely focused on traditional 3D representations of point clouds and meshes, but the discrete nature of these data makes the analysis susceptible to variations in input resolutions. Recent development of neural fields brings in level-set parameters from signed distance functions as a novel, continuous, and numerical representation of 3D shapes, where the shape surfaces are defined as zero-level-sets of those functions. This motivates us to extend shape analysis from the traditional 3D data to these novel parameter data. Since the level-set parameters are not Euclidean like point clouds, we establish correlations across different shapes by formulating them as a pseudo-normal distribution, and learn the distribution prior from the respective dataset. To further explore the level-set parameters with shape transformations, we propose to condition a subset of these parameters on rotations and translations, and generate them with a hypernetwork. This simplifies the pose-related shape analysis compared to using traditional data. We demonstrate the promise of the novel representations through applications in shape classification (arbitrary poses), retrieval, and 6D object pose estimation.

Existing real-world datasets primarily focus on table-top grasping scenarios, where a robot arm is placed in a fixed position and the objects are centralized within the FOV of fixed external camera(s). Assessing performance on such datasets may not accurately reflect the challenges encountered in everyday grasping and mobile manipulation tasks within kitchen environments such as retrieving objects from higher shelves, sinks, dishwashers, ovens, refrigerators, or microwaves. To address this gap, we present KITchen, a novel benchmark designed specifically for estimating the 6D poses of objects located in diverse positions within kitchen settings. For this purpose, we recorded a comprehensive dataset comprising around 205k real-world RGBD images for 111 kitchen objects captured in two distinct kitchens, utilizing a humanoid robot with its egocentric perspectives. Subsequently, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline, to streamline the labeling process of such datasets, resulting in the generation of 2D object labels, 2D object segmentation masks, and 6D object poses with minimal human effort.

Our approach relies on the evaluation of discrepancies in the geometry of the observed object, in particular its respective estimated back-projection in 3D, against a putative functional shape representation comprising mixtures of Gaussian Processes, that act as a template. Each Gaussian Process is trained to yield a fragment of the object's surface in a radial fashion with respect to designated reference points. We further define a pose confidence measure as the average probability of pixel back-projections in the Gaussian mixture. The goal of our experiments is two-fold. a) We demonstrate that our functional representation is sufficiently accurate as a shape template on which the probability of back-projected object points can be evaluated, and, b) we show that the resulting confidence scores based on these probabilities are indeed a consistent quality measure of pose.</p></details> |  |

Most current approaches are restricted to specific instances with known models or require ground truth depth information or point cloud captures from LIDAR. We tackle the harder problem of pose estimation for category-level objects from a single RGB image. We propose a novel solution that eliminates the need for specific object models or depth information. Our method utilises score-based diffusion models to generate object pose hypotheses to model the distribution of possible poses for the object. Unlike previous methods that rely on costly trained likelihood estimators to remove outliers before pose aggregation using mean pooling, we introduce a simpler approach using Mean Shift to estimate the mode of the distribution as the final pose estimate. Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the REAL275 dataset by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

In particular, partial observability, occlusions, and object symmetries eventually result in pose ambiguity. To account for this multimodality, this work proposes training a diffusion-based generative model for 6D object pose estimation. During inference, the trained generative model allows for sampling multiple particles, i.e., pose hypotheses. To distill this information into a single pose estimate, we propose two novel and effective pose selection strategies that do not require any additional training or computationally intensive operations. Moreover, while many existing methods for pose estimation primarily focus on the image domain and only incorporate depth information for final pose refinement, our model solely operates on point cloud data. The model thereby leverages recent advancements in point cloud processing and operates upon an SE(3)-equivariant latent space that forms the basis for the particle selection strategies and allows for improved inference times. Our thorough experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach on the Linemod dataset and showcase the effectiveness of our design choices.

Occlusion and incomplete object visibility are common challenges in this task, but existing pose refinement methods often struggle to handle these issues effectively. To tackle this problem, we propose a global motion-guided recurrent flow estimation method called GMFlow for pose estimation. GMFlow overcomes local ambiguities caused by occlusion or missing parts by seeking global explanations. We leverage the object's structural information to extend the motion of visible parts of the rigid body to its invisible regions. Specifically, we capture global contextual information through a linear attention mechanism and guide local motion information to generate global motion estimates. Furthermore, we introduce object shape constraints in the flow iteration process, making flow estimation suitable for pose estimation scenarios. Experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in accuracy while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose can utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD model, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input. Specifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse estimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight U-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is designed. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images. GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly competitive results. The code for GS2Pose will soon be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

| **[ZeroPose: CAD-Prompted Zero-shot Object 6D Pose Estimation in Cluttered Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17934v3)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robotics and industry applications have a high demand for the capability to estimate the 6D pose of novel objects from the cluttered scene. However, existing classic pose estimation methods are object-specific, which can only handle the specific objects seen during training. When applied to a novel object, these methods necessitate a cumbersome onboarding process, which involves extensive dataset preparation and model retraining. The extensive duration and resource consumption of onboarding limit their practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce ZeroPose, a novel zero-shot framework that performs pose estimation following a Discovery-Orientation-Registration (DOR) inference pipeline. This framework generalizes to novel objects without requiring model retraining. Given the CAD model of a novel object, ZeroPose enables in seconds onboarding time to extract visual and geometric embeddings from the CAD model as a prompt. With the prompting of the above embeddings, DOR can discover all related instances and estimate their 6D poses without additional human interaction or presupposing scene conditions. Compared with existing zero-shot methods solved by the render-and-compare paradigm, the DOR pipeline formulates the object pose estimation into a feature-matching problem, which avoids time-consuming online rendering and improves efficiency. Experimental results on the seven datasets show that ZeroPose as a zero-shot method achieves comparable performance with object-specific training methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot method with 50x inference speed improvement.</p></details> |  |

This problem is of particular interest for many practical applications in industrial tasks such as quality control, bin picking, and robotic manipulation, where both speed and accuracy are critical for real-world deployment. Current models, both classical and deep-learning-based, often struggle with the trade-off between accuracy and latency. Our research focuses on enhancing the speed of a prominent state-of-the-art deep learning model, GDRNPP, while keeping its high accuracy. We employ several techniques to reduce the model size and improve inference time. These techniques include using smaller and quicker backbones, pruning unnecessary parameters, and distillation to transfer knowledge from a large, high-performing model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed configuration maintains accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art while significantly improving inference time. This advancement could lead to more efficient and practical applications in various industrial scenarios, thereby enhancing the overall applicability of 6D Object Pose Estimation models in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Probabilistic Geometry-Guided Regression for 6DoF Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11819v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation is the problem of identifying the position and orientation of an object relative to a chosen coordinate system, which is a core technology for modern XR applications. State-of-the-art 6D object pose estimators directly predict an object pose given an object observation. Due to the ill-posed nature of the pose estimation problem, where multiple different poses can correspond to a single observation, generating additional plausible estimates per observation can be valuable. To address this, we reformulate the state-of-the-art algorithm GDRNPP and introduce EPRO-GDR (End-to-End Probabilistic Geometry-Guided Regression). Instead of predicting a single pose per detection, we estimate a probability density distribution of the pose. Using the evaluation procedure defined by the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) Challenge, we test our approach on four of its core datasets and demonstrate superior quantitative results for EPRO-GDR on LM-O, YCB-V, and ITODD. Our probabilistic solution shows that predicting a pose distribution instead of a single pose can improve state-of-the-art single-view pose estimation while providing the additional benefit of being able to sample multiple meaningful pose candidates.</p></details> |  |

However, recent methods for directly regressing poses from RGB images using dense features have achieved state-of-the-art results. Stereo vision, which provides an additional perspective on the object, can help reduce pose ambiguity and occlusion. Moreover, stereo can directly infer the distance of an object, while mono-vision requires internalized knowledge of the object's size. To extend the state-of-the-art in 6D object pose estimation to stereo, we created a BOP compatible stereo version of the YCB-V dataset. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation algorithms by utilizing stereo vision and can easily be adopted for other dense feature-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>4th I...</summary><p>4th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (ICPRAI)</p></details> |

In this context, RGB image and point-cloud observations are two commonly used modalities in visual-based robotic manipulation, but each of these modalities have their own limitations. Commercial point-cloud observations often suffer from issues like sparse sampling and noisy output due to the limits of the emission-reception imaging principle. On the other hand, RGB images, while rich in texture information, lack essential depth and 3D information crucial for robotic manipulation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an image-only robotic manipulation framework that leverages an eye-on-hand monocular camera installed on the robot's parallel gripper. By moving with the robot gripper, this camera gains the ability to actively perceive object from multiple perspectives during the manipulation process. This enables the estimation of 6D object poses, which can be utilized for manipulation. While, obtaining images from more and diverse viewpoints typically improves pose estimation, it also increases the manipulation time. To address this trade-off, we employ a reinforcement learning policy to synchronize the manipulation strategy with active perception, achieving a balance between 6D pose accuracy and manipulation efficiency. Our experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments showcase the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our approach. %, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve robust real-world robotic manipulation through active pose estimation. We believe that our method will inspire further research on real-world-oriented robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

| **[From Words to Poses: Enhancing Novel Object Pose Estimation with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05413v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots are increasingly envisioned to interact in real-world scenarios, where they must continuously adapt to new situations. To detect and grasp novel objects, zero-shot pose estimators determine poses without prior knowledge. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have shown considerable advances in robotics applications by establishing an understanding between language input and image input. In our work, we take advantage of VLMs zero-shot capabilities and translate this ability to 6D object pose estimation. We propose a novel framework for promptable zero-shot 6D object pose estimation using language embeddings. The idea is to derive a coarse location of an object based on the relevancy map of a language-embedded NeRF reconstruction and to compute the pose estimate with a point cloud registration method. Additionally, we provide an analysis of LERF's suitability for open-set object pose estimation. We examine hyperparameters, such as activation thresholds for relevancy maps and investigate the zero-shot capabilities on an instance- and category-level. Furthermore, we plan to conduct robotic grasping experiments in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Gaussian for Monocular 6D Pose Estimation from Sparse Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02581v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular object pose estimation, as a pivotal task in computer vision and robotics, heavily depends on accurate 2D-3D correspondences, which often demand costly CAD models that may not be readily available. Object 3D reconstruction methods offer an alternative, among which recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) afford a compelling potential. Yet its performance still suffers and tends to overfit with fewer input views. Embracing this challenge, we introduce SGPose, a novel framework for sparse view object pose estimation using Gaussian-based methods. Given as few as ten views, SGPose generates a geometric-aware representation by starting with a random cuboid initialization, eschewing reliance on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline-derived geometry as required by traditional 3DGS methods. SGPose removes the dependence on CAD models by regressing dense 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model from sparse input and random initialization, while the geometric-consistent depth supervision and online synthetic view warping are key to the success. Experiments on typical benchmarks, especially on the Occlusion LM-O dataset, demonstrate that SGPose outperforms existing methods even under sparse view constraints, under-scoring its potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

GS-Pose begins with a set of posed RGB images of a previously unseen object and builds three distinct representations stored in a database. At inference, GS-Pose operates sequentially by locating the object in the input image, estimating its initial 6D pose using a retrieval approach, and refining the pose with a render-and-compare method. The key insight is the application of the appropriate object representation at each stage of the process. In particular, for the refinement step, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique that offers high rendering speed and relatively low optimization time. Off-the-shelf toolchains and commodity hardware, such as mobile phones, can be used to capture new objects to be added to the database. Extensive evaluations on the LINEMOD and OnePose-LowTexture datasets demonstrate excellent performance, establishing the new state-of-the-art.

We initially detect instance-wise keypoints with a YOLOv8s model to compute 6D pose estimates of known objects by solving PnP. We use a ray tracing approach to track a geometric scene graph consisting of mesh models of object instances. In contrast to classical point-to-point matching, this leads to more robust results, especially under occlusions between objects instances. We show that using this hybrid strategy leads to robust self-localization, pre-segmentation of the range sensor data and accurate pose tracking of objects using the same environmental representation. All detected objects are integrated into a semantic scene graph. This scene graph then serves as a front end to a semantic mapping framework to allow spatial reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certifying Robustness of Learning-Based Keypoint Detection and Pose Estimation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00117v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the certification of the local robustness of vision-based two-stage 6D object pose estimation. The two-stage method for object pose estimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural network-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods' robustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on their local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust estimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform the certification of local robustness into neural network verification for classification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output specifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate verification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear operations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of injecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull representation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict semantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we propagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then formulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the setting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each pixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear, classification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both sound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on realistic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to certify the robustness of large-scale, keypoint-based pose estimation given images in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Unlike most existing real-world object-centric datasets which only come with RGB capturing, the direct capture of the depth channel allows better 3D annotations and broader downstream applications. WildRGB-D comprises large-scale category-level RGB-D object videos, which are taken using an iPhone to go around the objects in 360 degrees. It contains around 8500 recorded objects and nearly 20000 RGB-D videos across 46 common object categories. These videos are taken with diverse cluttered backgrounds with three setups to cover as many real-world scenarios as possible: (i) a single object in one video; (ii) multiple objects in one video; and (iii) an object with a static hand in one video. The dataset is annotated with object masks, real-world scale camera poses, and reconstructed aggregated point clouds from RGBD videos. We benchmark four tasks with WildRGB-D including novel view synthesis, camera pose estimation, object 6d pose estimation, and object surface reconstruction. Our experiments show that the large-scale capture of RGB-D objects provides a large potential to advance 3D object learning.

The widely available, inexpensive and high-resolution RGB sensors and CNNs that allow for fast inference based on this modality make monocular approaches especially well suited for robotics applications. We observe that previous surveys on object pose estimation establish the state of the art for varying modalities, single- and multi-view settings, and datasets and metrics that consider a multitude of applications. We argue, however, that those works' broad scope hinders the identification of open challenges that are specific to monocular approaches and the derivation of promising future challenges for their application in robotics. By providing a unified view on recent publications from both robotics and computer vision, we find that occlusion handling, novel pose representations, and formalizing and improving category-level pose estimation are still fundamental challenges that are highly relevant for robotics. Moreover, to further improve robotic performance, large object sets, novel objects, refractive materials, and uncertainty estimates are central, largely unsolved open challenges. In order to address them, ontological reasoning, deformability handling, scene-level reasoning, realistic datasets, and the ecological footprint of algorithms need to be improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Transactions on Robotics: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609560 arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.11827</p></details> |
| **[Shape-biased Texture Agnostic Representations for Improved Textureless and Metallic Object Detection and 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04878v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in machine learning have greatly benefited object detection and 6D pose estimation. However, textureless and metallic objects still pose a significant challenge due to few visual cues and the texture bias of CNNs. To address his issue, we propose a strategy for inducing a shape bias to CNN training. In particular, by randomizing textures applied to object surfaces during data rendering, we create training data without consistent textural cues. This methodology allows for seamless integration into existing data rendering engines, and results in negligible computational overhead for data rendering and network training. Our findings demonstrate that the shape bias we induce via randomized texturing, improves over existing approaches using style transfer. We evaluate with three detectors and two pose estimators. For the most recent object detector and for pose estimation in general, estimation accuracy improves for textureless and metallic objects. Additionally we show that our approach increases the pose estimation accuracy in the presence of image noise and strong illumination changes.

| **[FoundPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with Foundation Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18809v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FoundPose, a model-based method for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single RGB image. The method can quickly onboard new objects using their 3D models without requiring any object- or task-specific training. In contrast, existing methods typically pre-train on large-scale, task-specific datasets in order to generalize to new objects and to bridge the image-to-model domain gap. We demonstrate that such generalization capabilities can be observed in a recent vision foundation model trained in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, our method estimates the object pose from image-to-model 2D-3D correspondences, which are established by matching patch descriptors from the recent DINOv2 model between the image and pre-rendered object templates. We find that reliable correspondences can be established by kNN matching of patch descriptors from an intermediate DINOv2 layer. Such descriptors carry stronger positional information than descriptors from the last layer, and we show their importance when semantic information is ambiguous due to object symmetries or a lack of texture. To avoid establishing correspondences against all object templates, we develop an efficient template retrieval approach that integrates the patch descriptors into the bag-of-words representation and can promptly propose a handful of similarly looking templates. Additionally, we apply featuremetric alignment to compensate for discrepancies in the 2D-3D correspondences caused by coarse patch sampling. The resulting method noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for refinement-free pose estimation on the standard BOP benchmark with seven diverse datasets and can be seamlessly combined with an existing render-and-compare refinement method to achieve RGB-only state-of-the-art results.

Both factors limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a pipeline that does not require CAD models and allows training a state-of-the-art pose estimator requiring only a small set of real images as input. Our method is based on a NeuS2 object representation, that we learn through a semi-automated procedure based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and object-agnostic segmentation. We exploit the novel-view synthesis ability of NeuS2 and simple cut-and-paste augmentation to automatically generate photorealistic object renderings, which we use to train the correspondence-based SurfEmb pose estimator.

Our approach combines keypoint-based method with learnable pose regression through `keypoint-graph', which is a graph representation of the keypoints. KGpose first estimates 3D keypoints for each object using an attentional multi-modal feature fusion of RGB and point cloud features. These keypoints are estimated from each point of point cloud and converted into a graph representation. The network directly regresses 6D pose parameters for each point through a sequence of keypoint-graph embedding and local graph embedding which are designed with graph convolutions, followed by rotation and translation heads. The final pose for each object is selected from the candidates of point-wise predictions. The method achieves competitive results on the benchmark dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. KGpose enables multi-object pose estimation without requiring an extra localization step, offering a unified and efficient solution for understanding geometric contexts in complex scenes for robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to existing approaches, in our setting (i) the object of interest is specified solely through the textual prompt, (ii) no object model (e.g., CAD or video sequence) is required at inference, and (iii) the object is imaged from two RGBD viewpoints of different scenes. To operate in this setting, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model to segment the object of interest from the scenes and to estimate its relative 6D pose. The key of our approach is a carefully devised strategy to fuse object-level information provided by the prompt with local image features, resulting in a feature space that can generalize to novel concepts. We validate our approach on a new benchmark based on two popular datasets, REAL275 and Toyota-Light, which collectively encompass 34 object instances appearing in four thousand image pairs.

Learning based approaches typically require training data from a highly accurate CAD model or labeled training data acquired using a complex setup. We address this by learning to estimate pose from weakly labeled data without a known CAD model. We propose to use a NeRF to learn object shape implicitly which is later used to learn view-invariant features in conjunction with CNN using a contrastive loss. While NeRF helps in learning features that are view-consistent, CNN ensures that the learned features respect symmetry. During inference, CNN is used to predict view-invariant features which can be used to establish correspondences with the implicit 3d model in NeRF. The correspondences are then used to estimate the pose in the reference frame of NeRF. Our approach can also handle symmetric objects unlike other approaches using a similar training setup. Specifically, we learn viewpoint invariant, discriminative features using NeRF which are later used for pose estimation. We evaluated our approach on LM, LM-Occlusion, and T-Less dataset and achieved benchmark accuracy despite using weakly labeled data.</p></details> | 3DV 2024 |

To address these issues, this paper introduces Omni6DPose, a substantial dataset characterized by its diversity in object categories, large scale, and variety in object materials. Omni6DPose is divided into three main components: ROPE (Real 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), which includes 332K images annotated with over 1.5M annotations across 581 instances in 149 categories; SOPE(Simulated 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), consisting of 475K images created in a mixed reality setting with depth simulation, annotated with over 5M annotations across 4162 instances in the same 149 categories; and the manually aligned real scanned objects used in both ROPE and SOPE. Omni6DPose is inherently challenging due to the substantial variations and ambiguities. To address this challenge, we introduce GenPose++, an enhanced version of the SOTA category-level pose estimation framework, incorporating two pivotal improvements: Semantic-aware feature extraction and Clustering-based aggregation.

Domain randomization hereby plays an important role in reducing the simulation to reality gap. However, this generalization might not be effective in specialized domains like a production environment involving complex assemblies. Either the individual parts, trained with synthetic images, are integrated in much larger assemblies making them indistinguishable from their counterparts and result in false positives or are partially occluded just enough to give rise to false negatives. Domain knowledge is vital in these cases and if conceived effectively while generating synthetic data, can show a considerable improvement in bridging the simulation to reality gap.

| **[MatchU: Matching Unseen Objects for 6D Pose Estimation from RGB-D Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01517v2)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent learning methods for object pose estimation require resource-intensive training for each individual object instance or category, hampering their scalability in real applications when confronted with previously unseen objects. In this paper, we propose MatchU, a Fuse-Describe-Match strategy for 6D pose estimation from RGB-D images. MatchU is a generic approach that fuses 2D texture and 3D geometric cues for 6D pose prediction of unseen objects. We rely on learning geometric 3D descriptors that are rotation-invariant by design. By encoding pose-agnostic geometry, the learned descriptors naturally generalize to unseen objects and capture symmetries. To tackle ambiguous associations using 3D geometry only, we fuse additional RGB information into our descriptor. This is achieved through a novel attention-based mechanism that fuses cross-modal information, together with a matching loss that leverages the latent space learned from RGB data to guide the descriptor learning process. Extensive experiments reveal the generalizability of both the RGB-D fusion strategy as well as the descriptor efficacy. Benefiting from the novel designs, MatchU surpasses all existing methods by a significant margin in terms of both accuracy and speed, even without the requirement of expensive re-training or rendering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Quantification with Deep Ensembles for 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07741v2)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The estimation of 6D object poses is a fundamental task in many computer vision applications. Particularly, in high risk scenarios such as human-robot interaction, industrial inspection, and automation, reliable pose estimates are crucial. In the last years, increasingly accurate and robust deep-learning-based approaches for 6D object pose estimation have been proposed. Many top-performing methods are not end-to-end trainable but consist of multiple stages. In the context of deep uncertainty quantification, deep ensembles are considered as state of the art since they have been proven to produce well-calibrated and robust uncertainty estimates. However, deep ensembles can only be applied to methods that can be trained end-to-end. In this work, we propose a method to quantify the uncertainty of multi-stage 6D object pose estimation approaches with deep ensembles. For the implementation, we choose SurfEmb as representative, since it is one of the top-performing 6D object pose estimation approaches in the BOP Challenge 2022. We apply established metrics and concepts for deep uncertainty quantification to evaluate the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel uncertainty calibration score for regression tasks to quantify the quality of the estimated uncertainty.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Due to the lack of depth information, existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to occlusion and illumination changes. How to extract and utilize the geometry features in depth information is crucial to achieve accurate predictions. To this end, we propose TransPose, a novel 6D pose framework that exploits Transformer Encoder with geometry-aware module to develop better learning of point cloud feature representations. Specifically, we first uniformly sample point cloud and extract local geometry features with the designed local feature extractor base on graph convolution network. To improve robustness to occlusion, we adopt Transformer to perform the exchange of global information, making each local feature contains global information. Finally, we introduce geometry-aware module in Transformer Encoder, which to form an effective constrain for point cloud feature learning and makes the global information exchange more tightly coupled with point cloud tasks. Extensive experiments indicate the effectiveness of TransPose, our pose estimation pipeline achieves competitive results on three benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NEUROCOMPUTING</p></details> |

Besides the three tasks from 2022 (model-based 2D detection, 2D segmentation, and 6D localization of objects seen during training), the 2023 challenge introduced new variants of these tasks focused on objects unseen during training. In the new tasks, methods were required to learn new objects during a short onboarding stage (max 5 minutes, 1 GPU) from provided 3D object models. The best 2023 method for 6D localization of unseen objects (GenFlow) notably reached the accuracy of the best 2020 method for seen objects (CosyPose), although being noticeably slower. The best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose) achieved a moderate accuracy improvement but a significant 43% run-time improvement compared to the best 2022 counterpart (GDRNPP). Since 2017, the accuracy of 6D localization of seen objects has improved by more than 50% (from 56.9 to 85.6 AR_C).

In response, we introduce a novel score-based diffusion method applied to the $SE(3)$ group, marking the first application of diffusion models to $SE(3)$ within the image domain, specifically tailored for pose estimation tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the method's efficacy in handling pose ambiguity, mitigating perspective-induced ambiguity, and showcasing the robustness of our surrogate Stein score formulation on $SE(3)$. This formulation not only improves the convergence of denoising process but also enhances computational efficiency.

In this area, dense correspondence-based methods have achieved leading performance. However, they do not explicitly consider the local and global geometric information of different instances, resulting in poor generalization ability to unseen instances with significant shape variations. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel Instance-Adaptive and Geometric-Aware Keypoint Learning method for category-level 6D object pose estimation (AG-Pose), which includes two key designs: (1) The first design is an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Detection module, which can adaptively detect a set of sparse keypoints for various instances to represent their geometric structures. (2) The second design is a Geometric-Aware Feature Aggregation module, which can efficiently integrate the local and global geometric information into keypoint features. These two modules can work together to establish robust keypoint-level correspondences for unseen instances, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the model.Experimental results on CAMERA25 and REAL275 datasets show that the proposed AG-Pose outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin without category-specific shape priors.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

Our approach can be instantly applied at test-time to a novel object without fine-tuning, as long as its CAD model is given, or a small number of reference images are captured. We bridge the gap between these two setups with a neural implicit representation that allows for effective novel view synthesis, keeping the downstream pose estimation modules invariant under the same unified framework. Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation. Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin. In addition, it even achieves comparable results to instance-level methods despite the reduced assumptions. Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown appealing performance in generating high-quality images from random noise with high indeterminacy through step-by-step denoising. Inspired by their denoising capability, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework (6D-Diff) to handle the noise and indeterminacy in object pose estimation for better performance. In our framework, to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondence, we formulate 2D keypoints detection as a reverse diffusion (denoising) process. To facilitate such a denoising process, we design a Mixture-of-Cauchy-based forward diffusion process and condition the reverse process on the object features. Extensive experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 CAMERA-READY</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose HOIDiffusion for generating realistic and diverse 3D hand-object interaction data. Our model is a conditional diffusion model that takes both the 3D hand-object geometric structure and text description as inputs for image synthesis. This offers a more controllable and realistic synthesis as we can specify the structure and style inputs in a disentangled manner. HOIDiffusion is trained by leveraging a diffusion model pre-trained on large-scale natural images and a few 3D human demonstrations.

Specifically, previous methods for novel objects do not make good use of the target object's 3D shape information since they focus on generalization by processing the shape indirectly, making them less effective. We present GenFlow, an approach that enables both accuracy and generalization to novel objects with the guidance of the target object's shape. Our method predicts optical flow between the rendered image and the observed image and refines the 6D pose iteratively. It boosts the performance by a constraint of the 3D shape and the generalizable geometric knowledge learned from an end-to-end differentiable system. We further improve our model by designing a cascade network architecture to exploit the multi-scale correlations and coarse-to-fine refinement. GenFlow ranked first on the unseen object pose estimation benchmarks in both the RGB and RGB-D cases. It also achieves performance competitive with existing state-of-the-art methods for the seen object pose estimation without any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic Task Success Evaluation Under Multi-modal Non-Parametric Object Pose Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10874v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D object pose estimation is essential for various robotic tasks. Uncertain pose estimates can lead to task failures; however, a certain degree of error in the pose estimates is often acceptable. Hence, by quantifying errors in the object pose estimate and acceptable errors for task success, robots can make informed decisions. This is a challenging problem as both the object pose uncertainty and acceptable error for the robotic task are often multi-modal and cannot be parameterized with commonly used uni-modal distributions. In this paper, we introduce a framework for evaluating robotic task success under object pose uncertainty, representing both the estimated error space of the object pose and the acceptable error space for task success using multi-modal non-parametric probability distributions. The proposed framework pre-computes the acceptable error space for task success using dynamic simulations and subsequently integrates the pre-computed acceptable error space over the estimated error space of the object pose to predict the likelihood of the task success. We evaluated the proposed framework on two mobile manipulation tasks. Our results show that by representing the estimated and the acceptable error space using multi-modal non-parametric distributions, we achieve higher task success rates and fewer failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

GigaPose first leverages discriminative "templates", rendered images of the CAD models, to recover the out-of-plane rotation and then uses patch correspondences to estimate the four remaining parameters. Our approach samples templates in only a two-degrees-of-freedom space instead of the usual three and matches the input image to the templates using fast nearest-neighbor search in feature space, results in a speedup factor of 35x compared to the state of the art. Moreover, GigaPose is significantly more robust to segmentation errors. Our extensive evaluation on the seven core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated with existing refinement methods. Additionally, we show the potential of GigaPose with 3D models predicted by recent work on 3D reconstruction from a single image, relaxing the need for CAD models and making 6D pose object estimation much more convenient.

Despite the impressive progress enabled by deep learning, single-view RGB pose estimation models perform poorly in cluttered dynamic environments. Imbuing the rich temporal information contained in the video of scenes has the potential to enhance models ability to deal with the adverse effects of occlusion and the dynamic nature of the environments. Moreover, joint object detection and pose estimation models are better suited to leverage the co-dependent nature of the tasks for improving the accuracy of both tasks. To this end, we propose attention-based temporal fusion for multi-object 6D pose estimation that accumulates information across multiple frames of a video sequence. Our MOTPose method takes a sequence of images as input and performs joint object detection and pose estimation for all objects in one forward pass. It learns to aggregate both object embeddings and object parameters over multiple time steps using cross-attention-based fusion modules. We evaluate our method on the physically-realistic cluttered bin-picking dataset SynPick and the YCB-Video dataset and demonstrate improved pose estimation accuracy as well as better object detection accuracy</p></details> |  |

Fortunately, the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has showcased remarkable zero-shot transfer performance, which provides a promising solution to tackle this task. Motivated by this, we introduce SAM-6D, a novel framework designed to realize the task through two steps, including instance segmentation and pose estimation. Given the target objects, SAM-6D employs two dedicated sub-networks, namely Instance Segmentation Model (ISM) and Pose Estimation Model (PEM), to perform these steps on cluttered RGB-D images. ISM takes SAM as an advanced starting point to generate all possible object proposals and selectively preserves valid ones through meticulously crafted object matching scores in terms of semantics, appearance and geometry. By treating pose estimation as a partial-to-partial point matching problem, PEM performs a two-stage point matching process featuring a novel design of background tokens to construct dense 3D-3D correspondence, ultimately yielding the pose estimates. Without bells and whistles, SAM-6D outperforms the existing methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark for both instance segmentation and pose estimation of novel objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2024.

Current methods for scene understanding typically rely on a combination of trained models paired with either an explicit or learnt volumetric representation, all of which have their own drawbacks and limitations. We introduce DreamUp3D, a novel Object-Centric Generative Model (OCGM) designed explicitly to perform inference on a 3D scene informed only by a single RGB-D image. DreamUp3D is a self-supervised model, trained end-to-end, and is capable of segmenting objects, providing 3D object reconstructions, generating object-centric latent representations and accurate per-object 6D pose estimates. We compare DreamUp3D to baselines including NeRFs, pre-trained CLIP-features, ObSurf, and ObPose, in a range of tasks including 3D scene reconstruction, object matching and object pose estimation. Our experiments show that our model outperforms all baselines by a significant margin in real-world scenarios displaying its applicability for 3D scene understanding tasks while meeting the strict demands exhibited in robotics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving 2D-3D Dense Correspondences with Diffusion Models for 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06436v1)** | 2024-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating 2D-3D correspondences between RGB images and 3D space is a fundamental problem in 6D object pose estimation. Recent pose estimators use dense correspondence maps and Point-to-Point algorithms to estimate object poses. The accuracy of pose estimation depends heavily on the quality of the dense correspondence maps and their ability to withstand occlusion, clutter, and challenging material properties. Currently, dense correspondence maps are estimated using image-to-image translation models based on GANs, Autoencoders, or direct regression models. However, recent advancements in image-to-image translation have led to diffusion models being the superior choice when evaluated on benchmarking datasets. In this study, we compare image-to-image translation networks based on GANs and diffusion models for the downstream task of 6D object pose estimation. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion-based image-to-image translation model outperforms the GAN, revealing potential for further improvements in 6D object pose estimation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the First Austrian Symposium on AI, Robotics, and Vision 2024</p></details> |

The prior can be used to initialize the 3D object translation and facilitate 3D object rotation estimation. Unfortunately, the object detectors that are used for this purpose do not generalize to unseen objects. Therefore, existing 6D pose estimation methods for unseen objects either assume the ground-truth object location to be known or yield inaccurate results when it is unavailable. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a method, LocPoseNet, able to robustly learn location prior for unseen objects. Our method builds upon a template matching strategy, where we propose to distribute the reference kernels and convolve them with a query to efficiently compute multi-scale correlations. We then introduce a novel translation estimator, which decouples scale-aware and scale-robust features to predict different object location parameters. Our method outperforms existing works by a large margin on LINEMOD and GenMOP. We further construct a challenging synthetic dataset, which allows us to highlight the better robustness of our method to various noise sources.

There are two main deep learning approaches for this: geometric representation regression and iterative refinement. However, these methods have some limitations that reduce their effectiveness. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and propose new strategies to overcome them. To tackle the issue of blurry geometric representation, we use positional encoding with high-frequency components for the object's 3D coordinates. To address the local minimum problem in refinement methods, we introduce a normalized image plane-based multi-reference refinement strategy that's independent of intrinsic matrix constraints. Lastly, we utilize adaptive instance normalization and a simple occlusion augmentation method to help our model concentrate on the target object. Our experiments on Linemod, Linemod-Occlusion, and YCB-Video datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods. We will soon release the code.</p></details> |  |

To evaluate the robustness of SNEs on noisy data, we create a large-scale synthetic surface normal (SSN) dataset containing 20 scenarios (ten indoor scenarios and ten outdoor scenarios with and without random Gaussian noise added to depth images). Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3F2N+ achieves greater performance than all other geometry-based surface normal estimators, with average angular errors of 7.85$^\circ$, 8.95$^\circ$, 9.25$^\circ$, and 11.98$^\circ$ on the clean-indoor, clean-outdoor, noisy-indoor, and noisy-outdoor datasets, respectively. We conduct three additional experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating our proposed 3F2N+ into downstream robot perception tasks, including freespace detection, 6D object pose estimation, and point cloud completion.

Examples include maintaining a constant relative 6D pose of the robot arm with respect to the object, grasping the dynamically moving object, or co-manipulating the object together with a human. Fast and accurate 6D pose estimation is crucial to achieve smooth and stable robot control in such situations. The contributions of this work are three fold. First, we propose a new visual perception module that asynchronously combines accurate learning-based 6D object pose localizer and a high-rate model-based 6D pose tracker. The outcome is a low-latency accurate and temporally consistent 6D object pose estimation from the input video stream at up to 120 Hz. Second, we develop a visually guided robot arm controller that combines the new visual perception module with a torque-based model predictive control algorithm. Asynchronous combination of the visual and robot proprioception signals at their corresponding frequencies results in stable and robust 6D object pose guided robot arm control. Third, we experimentally validate the proposed approach on a challenging 6D pose estimation benchmark and demonstrate 6D object pose-guided control with dynamically moving objects on a real 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE(3) Diffusion Model-based Point Cloud Registration for Robust 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17359v1)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce an SE(3) diffusion model-based point cloud registration framework for 6D object pose estimation in real-world scenarios. Our approach formulates the 3D registration task as a denoising diffusion process, which progressively refines the pose of the source point cloud to obtain a precise alignment with the model point cloud. Training our framework involves two operations: An SE(3) diffusion process and an SE(3) reverse process. The SE(3) diffusion process gradually perturbs the optimal rigid transformation of a pair of point clouds by continuously injecting noise (perturbation transformation). By contrast, the SE(3) reverse process focuses on learning a denoising network that refines the noisy transformation step-by-step, bringing it closer to the optimal transformation for accurate pose estimation. Unlike standard diffusion models used in linear Euclidean spaces, our diffusion model operates on the SE(3) manifold. This requires exploiting the linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{se}(3)$ associated with SE(3) to constrain the transformation transitions during the diffusion and reverse processes. Additionally, to effectively train our denoising network, we derive a registration-specific variational lower bound as the optimization objective for model learning. Furthermore, we show that our denoising network can be constructed with a surrogate registration model, making our approach applicable to different deep registration networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our diffusion registration framework presents outstanding pose estimation performance on the real-world TUD-L, LINEMOD, and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS-2023</p></details> |

At any given time during the manipulation of the object, we assume access to the robot joint controls and an image from a camera. We use the robot joint controls to perform a physics-based prediction of how the object might be moving. We then combine this prediction with the observation coming from the camera, to estimate the object pose as accurately as possible. We use a particle filtering approach to combine the control information with the visual information. We compare the proposed method with two baselines: (i) using only an image-based pose estimation system at each time-step, and (ii) a particle filter which does not perform the computationally expensive physics predictions, but assumes the object moves with constant velocity. Our results show that making physics-based predictions is worth the computational cost, resulting in more accurate tracking, and estimating object pose even when the object is not clearly visible to the camera.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to learn 6D poses for roboticassembly by natural language instructions. For this purpose, Language-Instructed 6D Pose Regression Network (LanPose) is proposed to jointly predict the 6D poses of the observed object and the corresponding assembly position. Our proposed approach is based on the fusion of geometric and linguistic features, which allows us to finely integrate multi-modality input and map it to the 6D pose in SE(3) space by the cross-attention mechanism and the language-integrated 6D pose mapping module, respectively. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, an integrated robotic system is established to precisely and robustly perceive, grasp, manipulate and assemble blocks by language commands. 98.09 and 93.55 in ADD(-S)-0.1d are derived for the prediction of 6D object pose and 6D assembly pose, respectively.

Specifically, we employ a neural process-based meta-learning approach to train an encoder to capture texture and geometry of an object in a latent representation, based on very few RGB-D images and ground-truth keypoints. The latent representation is then used by a simultaneously meta-trained decoder to predict the 6D pose of the object in new images. Furthermore, we propose a novel geometry-aware decoder for the keypoint prediction using a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which explicitly takes geometric constraints specific to each object into consideration. To evaluate our algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on the \linemod dataset, and on our new fully-annotated synthetic datasets generated from Multiple Categories in Multiple Scenes (MCMS). Experimental results demonstrate that our model performs well on unseen objects with very different shapes and appearances. Remarkably, our model also shows robust performance on occluded scenes although trained fully on data without occlusion. To our knowledge, this is the first work exploring \textbf{cross-category level} 6D pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR2022 workshop: Women in Computer Vision (WiCV)</p></details> |
| **[Linear-Covariance Loss for End-to-End Learning of 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11516v2)** | 2023-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most modern image-based 6D object pose estimation methods learn to predict 2D-3D correspondences, from which the pose can be obtained using a PnP solver. Because of the non-differentiable nature of common PnP solvers, these methods are supervised via the individual correspondences. To address this, several methods have designed differentiable PnP strategies, thus imposing supervision on the pose obtained after the PnP step. Here, we argue that this conflicts with the averaging nature of the PnP problem, leading to gradients that may encourage the network to degrade the accuracy of individual correspondences. To address this, we derive a loss function that exploits the ground truth pose before solving the PnP problem. Specifically, we linearize the PnP solver around the ground-truth pose and compute the covariance of the resulting pose distribution. We then define our loss based on the diagonal covariance elements, which entails considering the final pose estimate yet not suffering from the PnP averaging issue. Our experiments show that our loss consistently improves the pose estimation accuracy for both dense and sparse correspondence based methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on both Linemod-Occluded and YCB-Video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Fully Convolutional Geometric Features for Object 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15514v2)** | 2023-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works on 6D object pose estimation focus on learning keypoint correspondences between images and object models, and then determine the object pose through RANSAC-based algorithms or by directly regressing the pose with end-to-end optimisations. We argue that learning point-level discriminative features is overlooked in the literature. To this end, we revisit Fully Convolutional Geometric Features (FCGF) and tailor it for object 6D pose estimation to achieve state-of-the-art performance. FCGF employs sparse convolutions and learns point-level features using a fully-convolutional network by optimising a hardest contrastive loss. We can outperform recent competitors on popular benchmarks by adopting key modifications to the loss and to the input data representations, by carefully tuning the training strategies, and by employing data augmentations suitable for the underlying problem. We carry out a thorough ablation to study the contribution of each modification. The code is available at https://github.com/jcorsetti/FCGF6D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version, 18 pages and 13 figures.

| **[ZS6D: Zero-shot 6D Object Pose Estimation using Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11986v1)** | 2023-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robotic systems increasingly encounter complex and unconstrained real-world scenarios, there is a demand to recognize diverse objects. The state-of-the-art 6D object pose estimation methods rely on object-specific training and therefore do not generalize to unseen objects. Recent novel object pose estimation methods are solving this issue using task-specific fine-tuned CNNs for deep template matching. This adaptation for pose estimation still requires expensive data rendering and training procedures. MegaPose for example is trained on a dataset consisting of two million images showing 20,000 different objects to reach such generalization capabilities. To overcome this shortcoming we introduce ZS6D, for zero-shot novel object 6D pose estimation. Visual descriptors, extracted using pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT), are used for matching rendered templates against query images of objects and for establishing local correspondences. These local correspondences enable deriving geometric correspondences and are used for estimating the object's 6D pose with RANSAC-based PnP. This approach showcases that the image descriptors extracted by pre-trained ViTs are well-suited to achieve a notable improvement over two state-of-the-art novel object 6D pose estimation methods, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments are performed on LMO, YCBV, and TLESS. In comparison to one of the two methods we improve the Average Recall on all three datasets and compared to the second method we improve on two datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Based Underwater 6D Pose Estimation from RGB](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06821v2)** | 2023-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation underwater allows an autonomous system to perform tracking and intervention tasks. Nonetheless, underwater target pose estimation is remarkably challenging due to, among many factors, limited visibility, light scattering, cluttered environments, and constantly varying water conditions. An approach is to employ sonar or laser sensing to acquire 3D data, however, the data is not clear and the sensors expensive. For this reason, the community has focused on extracting pose estimates from RGB input. In this work, we propose an approach that leverages 2D object detection to reliably compute 6D pose estimates in different underwater scenarios. We test our proposal with 4 objects with symmetrical shapes and poor texture spanning across 33,920 synthetic and 10 real scenes. All objects and scenes are made available in an open-source dataset that includes annotations for object detection and pose estimation. When benchmarking against similar end-to-end methodologies for 6D object pose estimation, our pipeline provides estimates that are 8% more accurate. We also demonstrate the real world usability of our pose estimation pipeline on an underwater robotic manipulator in a reaching task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under RA-L Submission</p></details> |
| **[Exploiting Point-Wise Attention in 6D Object Pose Estimation Based on Bidirectional Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08518v3)** | 2023-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional geometric registration based estimation methods only exploit the CAD model implicitly, which leads to their dependence on observation quality and deficiency to occlusion. To address the problem,the paper proposes a bidirectional correspondence prediction network with a point-wise attention-aware mechanism. This network not only requires the model points to predict the correspondence but also explicitly models the geometric similarities between observations and the model prior. Our key insight is that the correlations between each model point and scene point provide essential information for learning point-pair matches. To further tackle the correlation noises brought by feature distribution divergence, we design a simple but effective pseudo-siamese network to improve feature homogeneity. Experimental results on the public datasets of LineMOD, YCB-Video, and Occ-LineMOD show that the proposed method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art methods under the same evaluation criteria. Its robustness in estimating poses is greatly improved, especially in an environment with severe occlusions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViHOPE: Visuotactile In-Hand Object 6D Pose Estimation with Shape Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05662v1)** | 2023-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this letter, we introduce ViHOPE, a novel framework for estimating the 6D pose of an in-hand object using visuotactile perception. Our key insight is that the accuracy of the 6D object pose estimate can be improved by explicitly completing the shape of the object. To this end, we introduce a novel visuotactile shape completion module that uses a conditional Generative Adversarial Network to complete the shape of an in-hand object based on volumetric representation. This approach improves over prior works that directly regress visuotactile observations to a 6D pose. By explicitly completing the shape of the in-hand object and jointly optimizing the shape completion and pose estimation tasks, we improve the accuracy of the 6D object pose estimate. We train and test our model on a synthetic dataset and compare it with the state-of-the-art. In the visuotactile shape completion task, we outperform the state-of-the-art by 265% using the Intersection of Union metric and achieve 88% lower Chamfer Distance. In the visuotactile pose estimation task, we present results that suggest our framework reduces position and angular errors by 35% and 64%, respectively. Furthermore, we ablate our framework to confirm the gain on the 6D object pose estimate from explicitly completing the shape. Ultimately, we show that our framework produces models that are robust to sim-to-real transfer on a real-world robot platform.</p></details> | Accepted by RA-L |
| **[NeRF-Pose: A First-Reconstruct-Then-Regress Approach for Weakly-supervised 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04802v2)** | 2023-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose estimation of 3D objects in monocular images is a fundamental and long-standing problem in computer vision. Existing deep learning approaches for 6D pose estimation typically rely on the assumption of availability of 3D object models and 6D pose annotations. However, precise annotation of 6D poses in real data is intricate, time-consuming and not scalable, while synthetic data scales well but lacks realism. To avoid these problems, we present a weakly-supervised reconstruction-based pipeline, named NeRF-Pose, which needs only 2D object segmentation and known relative camera poses during training. Following the first-reconstruct-then-regress idea, we first reconstruct the objects from multiple views in the form of an implicit neural representation. Then, we train a pose regression network to predict pixel-wise 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model. At inference, the approach only needs a single image as input. A NeRF-enabled PnP+RANSAC algorithm is used to estimate stable and accurate pose from the predicted correspondences. Experiments on LineMod and LineMod-Occlusion show that the proposed method has state-of-the-art accuracy in comparison to the best 6D pose estimation methods in spite of being trained only with weak labels. Besides, we extend the Homebrewed DB dataset with more real training images to support the weakly supervised task and achieve compelling results on this dataset. The extended dataset and code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and efficient solutions are required for several real-world applications including animation, human-robot interaction, surveillance, and sports. However, challenges such as occlusions, 2D pose mismatches, random camera perspectives, and limited 3D labelled data have been hampering the models' performance and limiting their deployment in real-world scenarios. The higher availability of cameras has led researchers to explore multi-view solutions to take advantage of the different perspectives to reconstruct the pose. Most existing reviews have mainly focused on monocular 3D human pose estimation, so a comprehensive survey on multi-view approaches has been missing since 2012. According to the reviewed articles, the majority of the existing methods are fully-supervised approaches based on geometric constraints, which are often limited by 2D pose mismatches. To mitigate this, researchers have proposed incorporating temporal consistency or depth information. Alternatively, working directly with 3D features has been shown to completely overcome this issue, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity. Additionally, models with lower levels of supervision have been identified to help address challenges such as annotated data scarcity and generalisation to new setups. Therefore, no method currently addresses all challenges associated with 3D pose reconstruction, and a trade-off between complexity and performance exists. Further research is needed to develop approaches capable of quickly inferring a highly accurate 3D pose with bearable computation cost. Techniques such as active learning, low-supervision methods, temporal consistency, view selection, depth information estimation, and multi-modal approaches are strategies to consider when developing a new method for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 tables, 6 figures, accepted at Image and Vision Computing (IMAVIS)</p></details> |

However, accurate human joint estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda) Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation, window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error. This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose, with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realizing Text-Driven Motion Generation on NAO Robot: A Reinforcement Learning-Optimized Control Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05117v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion retargeting for humanoid robots, transferring human motion data to robots for imitation, presents significant challenges but offers considerable potential for real-world applications. Traditionally, this process relies on human demonstrations captured through pose estimation or motion capture systems. In this paper, we explore a text-driven approach to mapping human motion to humanoids. To address the inherent discrepancies between the generated motion representations and the kinematic constraints of humanoid robots, we propose an angle signal network based on norm-position and rotation loss (NPR Loss). It generates joint angles, which serve as inputs to a reinforcement learning-based whole-body joint motion control policy. The policy ensures tracking of the generated motions while maintaining the robot's stability during execution. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, successfully transferring text-driven human motion to a real humanoid robot NAO.</p></details> |  |
| **[LGM-Pose: A Lightweight Global Modeling Network for Real-time Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04561v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Turn: At Home Turning Angle Estimation for Parkinson's Disease Severity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08182v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses. Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on free-living home settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.</p></details> |  |

Our work builds upon state-of-the-art advances in the area of human pose estimation, graph-attention neural networks, and transformer interpretablity. The downstream task is to assist rehabilitation by providing informative feedback to users while they are performing prescribed exercises. We utilize a contrastive learning strategy during training. Given a tuple of correctly and incorrectly executed exercises, our model is able to identify and highlight those joints that are involved in an incorrect movement and thus require the user's attention. We collected an in-house dataset, ExeCheck, with paired recordings of both correct and incorrect execution of exercises. In our experiments, we tested our method on this dataset as well as the UI-PRMD dataset and found ExeCheck outperformed the baseline method using pairwise sequence alignment in identifying joints of physical relevance in rehabilitation exercises.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Pyramid-structured Long-range Dependencies for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02853v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial constraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA) module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/MingjieWe/PGFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking 3D Human Pose Estimation Models under Occlusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10350v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Pose Estimation (HPE) involves detecting and localizing keypoints on the human body from visual data. In 3D HPE, occlusions, where parts of the body are not visible in the image, pose a significant challenge for accurate pose reconstruction. This paper presents a benchmark on the robustness of 3D HPE models under realistic occlusion conditions, involving combinations of occluded keypoints commonly observed in real-world scenarios. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D HPE models, spanning convolutional, transformer-based, graph-based, and diffusion-based architectures, using the BlendMimic3D dataset, a synthetic dataset with ground-truth 2D/3D annotations and occlusion labels. All models were originally trained on Human3.6M and tested here without retraining to assess their generalization. We introduce a protocol that simulates occlusion by adding noise into 2D keypoints based on real detector behavior, and conduct both global and per-joint sensitivity analyses. Our findings reveal that all models exhibit notable performance degradation under occlusion, with diffusion-based models underperforming despite their stochastic nature. Additionally, a per-joint occlusion analysis identifies consistent vulnerability in distal joints (e.g., wrists, feet) across models. Overall, this work highlights critical limitations of current 3D HPE models in handling occlusions, and provides insights for improving real-world robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refinement Module based on Parse Graph of Feature Map for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11069v6)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parse graph play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of human pose estimation (HPE). Its key advantage lies in its hierarchical structure, like a tree structure, and context relations among nodes, enabling more accurate for inference. To equip models with the advantage of parse graphs, many researchers design frameworks based on the parse graph of body structure for HPE. However, these frameworks struggle with deviations from predefined parse graphs and incur high parameter counts. Unlike them, we view the feature map holistically, much like the human body. It can be optimized using parse graphs, where nodes' implicit feature representation boosts adaptability, avoiding rigid structural limitations. In this paper, we design the Refinement Module based on the Parse Graph of feature map (RMPG), comprising two stages: top-down decomposition and bottom-up combination. The first stage constructs feature maps into a tree structure via recursive decomposition, where each node represents a sub-feature map for hierarchical feature modeling. The second stage calculates context information and recursively connects sub-feature maps with context information to gradually build a refined feature map. Additionally, we design a hierarchical network with fewer parameters using multiple RMPG modules to model the context relations and hierarchies in the parse graph of body structure for HPE. Our network achieves excellent results on major HPE benchmarks and the effectiveness of RMPG is proven on different methods. RMPG code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improvement of human health lifespan with hybrid group pose estimation methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03169v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human beings rely heavily on estimation of poses in order to access their body movements. Human pose estimation methods take advantage of computer vision advances in order to track human body movements in real life applications. This comes from videos which are recorded through available devices. These para-digms provide potential to make human movement measurement more accessible to users. The consumers of pose estimation movements believe that human poses content tend to supplement available videos. This has increased pose estimation software usage to estimate human poses. In order to address this problem, we develop hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method to improve human health. This proposed hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method aims to detect multi-person poses using modified group pose estimation and modified real time pose estimation. This ensemble allows fusion of performance of stated methods in real time. The input poses from images are fed into individual meth-ods. The pose transformation method helps to identify relevant features for en-semble to perform training effectively. After this, customized pre-trained hybrid ensemble is trained on public benchmarked datasets which is being evaluated through test datasets. The effectiveness and viability of proposed method is estab-lished based on comparative analysis of group pose estimation methods and ex-periments conducted on benchmarked datasets. It provides best optimized results in real-time pose estimation. It makes pose estimation method more robust to oc-clusion and improves dense regression accuracy. These results have affirmed po-tential application of this method in several real-time situations with improvement in human health life span</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiFormer: A Multi-Person Pose Estimation System Based on CSI and Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22555v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation based on Channel State Information (CSI) has emerged as a promising approach for non-intrusive and precise human activity monitoring, yet faces challenges including accurate multi-person pose recognition and effective CSI feature learning. This paper presents MultiFormer, a wireless sensing system that accurately estimates human pose through CSI. The proposed system adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor with multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model inter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The extracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on on the public MM-Fi dataset and our self-collected dataset show that the MultiFormer achieves higher accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, especially for high-mobility keypoints (wrists, elbows) that are particularly difficult for previous methods to accurately estimate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantics-aware Test-time Adaptation for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10724v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work highlights a semantics misalignment in 3D human pose estimation. For the task of test-time adaptation, the misalignment manifests as overly smoothed and unguided predictions. The smoothing settles predictions towards some average pose. Furthermore, when there are occlusions or truncations, the adaptation becomes fully unguided. To this end, we pioneer the integration of a semantics-aware motion prior for the test-time adaptation of 3D pose estimation. We leverage video understanding and a well-structured motion-text space to adapt the model motion prediction to adhere to video semantics during test time. Additionally, we incorporate a missing 2D pose completion based on the motion-text similarity. The pose completion strengthens the motion prior's guidance for occlusions and truncations. Our method significantly improves state-of-the-art 3D human pose estimation TTA techniques, with more than 12% decrease in PA-MPJPE on 3DPW and 3DHP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

However, many existing methods rely on RGB cameras and do not account for low-light environments or motion blur. Event-based cameras have the potential to address these challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel task of human pose estimation using a front-facing event-based camera mounted on the head and propose D-EventEgo, the first framework for this task. The proposed method first estimates the head poses, and then these are used as conditions to generate body poses. However, when estimating head poses, the presence of dynamic objects mixed with background events may reduce head pose estimation accuracy. Therefore, we introduce the Motion Segmentation Module to remove dynamic objects and extract background information. Extensive experiments on our synthetic event-based dataset derived from EgoBody, demonstrate that our approach outperforms our baseline in four out of five evaluation metrics in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICIP 2025, Project Page: https://wataru823.github.io/D-EventEgo/</p></details> |
| **[Spectral Compression Transformer with Line Pose Graph for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21309v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based 3D human pose estimation methods suffer from high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length. Additionally, pose sequences often contain significant redundancy between frames. However, recent methods typically fail to improve model capacity while effectively eliminating sequence redundancy. In this work, we introduce the Spectral Compression Transformer (SCT) to reduce sequence length and accelerate computation. The SCT encoder treats hidden features between blocks as Temporal Feature Signals (TFS) and applies the Discrete Cosine Transform, a Fourier transform-based technique, to determine the spectral components to be retained. By filtering out certain high-frequency noise components, SCT compresses the sequence length and reduces redundancy. To further enrich the input sequence with prior structural information, we propose the Line Pose Graph (LPG) based on line graph theory. The LPG generates skeletal position information that complements the input 2D joint positions, thereby improving the model's performance. Finally, we design a dual-stream network architecture to effectively model spatial joint relationships and the compressed motion trajectory within the pose sequence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency. For example, on the Human3.6M dataset, our method achieves an MPJPE of 37.7mm while maintaining a low computational cost. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on each module to assess its effectiveness. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion for Monocular 3-D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20611v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods for 3-D human pose estimation face significant computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of self-attention mechanism complexity with sequence length. Recently, the Mamba model has substantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding performance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM). However, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3-D joint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution structure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To address these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in this paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction and length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing effective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint sequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba model by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling it to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a Spatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial relationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal topology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing human structural relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets for testing and comparison, and the results show that the proposed method greatly reduces computational cost while achieving higher accuracy. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptHMR: Promptable Human Mesh Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06397v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation presents challenges in diverse scenarios such as crowded scenes, person-person interactions, and single-view reconstruction. Existing approaches lack mechanisms to incorporate auxiliary "side information" that could enhance reconstruction accuracy in such challenging scenarios. Furthermore, the most accurate methods rely on cropped person detections and cannot exploit scene context while methods that process the whole image often fail to detect people and are less accurate than methods that use crops. While recent language-based methods explore HPS reasoning through large language or vision-language models, their metric accuracy is well below the state of the art. In contrast, we present PromptHMR, a transformer-based promptable method that reformulates HPS estimation through spatial and semantic prompts. Our method processes full images to maintain scene context and accepts multiple input modalities: spatial prompts like bounding boxes and masks, and semantic prompts like language descriptions or interaction labels. PromptHMR demonstrates robust performance across challenging scenarios: estimating people from bounding boxes as small as faces in crowded scenes, improving body shape estimation through language descriptions, modeling person-person interactions, and producing temporally coherent motions in videos. Experiments on benchmarks show that PromptHMR achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering flexible prompt-based control over the HPS estimation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[PoseBH: Prototypical Multi-Dataset Training Beyond Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17475v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study multi-dataset training (MDT) for pose estimation, where skeletal heterogeneity presents a unique challenge that existing methods have yet to address. In traditional domains, \eg regression and classification, MDT typically relies on dataset merging or multi-head supervision. However, the diversity of skeleton types and limited cross-dataset supervision complicate integration in pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce PoseBH, a new MDT framework that tackles keypoint heterogeneity and limited supervision through two key techniques. First, we propose nonparametric keypoint prototypes that learn within a unified embedding space, enabling seamless integration across skeleton types. Second, we develop a cross-type self-supervision mechanism that aligns keypoint predictions with keypoint embedding prototypes, providing supervision without relying on teacher-student models or additional augmentations. PoseBH substantially improves generalization across whole-body and animal pose datasets, including COCO-WholeBody, AP-10K, and APT-36K, while preserving performance on standard human pose benchmarks (COCO, MPII, and AIC). Furthermore, our learned keypoint embeddings transfer effectively to hand shape estimation (InterHand2.6M) and human body shape estimation (3DPW). The code for PoseBH is available at: https://github.com/uyoung-jeong/PoseBH.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

While many studies address either full-body pose prediction or motion trajectory prediction, only a few attempt to merge them. We propose a motion transformation technique to simultaneously predict full-body pose and trajectory key-points in a global coordinate frame. We utilize an off-the-shelf 3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware navigation. We introduce a human navigation dataset ``DARKO'' with specific focus on navigational activities that are relevant for human-aware mobile robot navigation. We perform extensive evaluation on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and our DARKO dataset. In comparison to prior work, we show that our approach is compact, real-time, and accurate in predicting human navigation motion across all datasets.

While emerging technologies are making it easier to capture kinematics with biomechanical models, or how joint angles change over time, inferring the underlying physics that give rise to these movements, including ground reaction forces, joint torques, or even muscle activations, is still challenging. Here we explore whether imitation learning applied to a biomechanical model from a large dataset of movements from able-bodied and impaired individuals can learn to compute these inverse dynamics. Although imitation learning in human pose estimation has seen great interest in recent years, our work differences in several ways: we focus on using an accurate biomechanical model instead of models adopted for computer vision, we test it on a dataset that contains participants with impaired movements, we reported detailed tracking metrics relevant for the clinical measurement of movement including joint angles and ground contact events, and finally we apply imitation learning to a muscle-driven neuromusculoskeletal model. We show that our imitation learning policy, KinTwin, can accurately replicate the kinematics of a wide range of movements, including those with assistive devices or therapist assistance, and that it can infer clinically meaningful differences in joint torques and muscle activations. Our work demonstrates the potential for using imitation learning to enable high-quality movement analysis in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Keypoints as Dynamic Centroids for Unified Human Pose and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12130v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic movement of the human body presents a fundamental challenge for human pose estimation and body segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on combining keypoint heatmaps with segmentation masks but often struggle in scenarios involving overlapping joints or rapidly changing poses during instance-level segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose Keypoints as Dynamic Centroid (KDC), a new centroid-based representation for unified human pose estimation and instance-level segmentation. KDC adopts a bottom-up paradigm to generate keypoint heatmaps for both easily distinguishable and complex keypoints and improves keypoint detection and confidence scores by introducing KeyCentroids using a keypoint disk. It leverages high-confidence keypoints as dynamic centroids in the embedding space to generate MaskCentroids, allowing for swift clustering of pixels to specific human instances during rapid body movements in live environments. Our experimental evaluations on the CrowdPose, OCHuman, and COCO benchmarks demonstrate KDC's effectiveness and generalizability in challenging scenarios in terms of both accuracy and runtime performance.

| **[Black-box Adversaries from Latent Space: Unnoticeable Attacks on Human Pose and Shape Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12009v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expressive human pose and shape (EHPS) estimation is vital for digital human generation, particularly in live-streaming applications. However, most existing EHPS models focus primarily on minimizing estimation errors, with limited attention on potential security vulnerabilities. Current adversarial attacks on EHPS models often require white-box access (e.g., model details or gradients) or generate visually conspicuous perturbations, limiting their practicality and ability to expose real-world security threats. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Unnoticeable Black-Box Attack (UBA) against EHPS models. UBA leverages the latent-space representations of natural images to generate an optimal adversarial noise pattern and iteratively refine its attack potency along an optimized direction in digital space. Crucially, this process relies solely on querying the model's output, requiring no internal knowledge of the EHPS architecture, while guiding the noise optimization toward greater stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments and visual analyses demonstrate the superiority of UBA. Notably, UBA increases the pose estimation errors of EHPS models by 17.27%-58.21% on average, revealing critical vulnerabilities. These findings underscore the urgent need to address and mitigate security risks associated with digital human generation systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

In order to overcome this difficulty, we present ElderFallGuard: A Computer Vision Based IoT Solution for Elderly Fall Detection and Notification, a cutting-edge, non-invasive system intended for quick caregiver alerts and real-time fall detection. Our approach leverages the power of computer vision, utilizing MediaPipe for accurate human pose estimation from standard video streams. We developed a custom dataset comprising 7200 samples across 12 distinct human poses to train and evaluate various machine learning classifiers, with Random Forest ultimately selected for its superior performance. ElderFallGuard employs a specific detection logic, identifying a fall when a designated prone pose ("Pose6") is held for over 3 seconds coupled with a significant drop in motion detected for more than 2 seconds. Upon confirmation, the system instantly dispatches an alert, including a snapshot of the event, to a designated Telegram group via a custom bot, incorporating cooldown logic to prevent notification overload. Rigorous testing on our dataset demonstrated exceptional results, achieving 100% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

In practice, however, systems must adapt to diverse viewpoints, environments, and camera setups -- conditions that differ significantly from those encountered during training, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we present a standardized testing environment in which each method is evaluated on a variety of datasets, ensuring consistent and fair cross-dataset comparisons -- allowing for the analysis of methods on previously unseen data. Therefore, we propose PoseBench3D, a unified framework designed to systematically re-evaluate prior and future models across four of the most widely used datasets for human pose estimation -- with the framework able to support novel and future datasets as the field progresses. Through a unified interface, our framework provides datasets in a pre-configured yet easily modifiable format, ensuring compatibility with diverse model architectures. We re-evaluated the work of 18 methods, either trained or gathered from existing literature, and reported results using both Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and Procrustes Aligned Mean Per Joint Position Error (PA-MPJPE) metrics, yielding more than 100 novel cross-dataset evaluation results. Additionally, we analyze performance differences resulting from various pre-processing techniques and dataset preparation parameters -- offering further insight into model generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/bryanjvela/PoseLab3D/tree/submission_branch</p></details> |

We bridge this gap by leveraging large multimodal models (LMMs) as priors for reconstructing contact poses, offering a scalable alternative to traditional methods that rely on human annotations or motion capture data. Our approach extracts contact-relevant descriptors from an LMM and translates them into tractable losses to constrain 3D human pose optimization. Despite its simplicity, our method produces compelling reconstructions for both two-person interactions and self-contact scenarios, accurately capturing the semantics of physical and social interactions. Our results demonstrate that LMMs can serve as powerful tools for contact prediction and pose estimation, offering an alternative to costly manual human annotations or motion capture data.

| **[Optimal-state Dynamics Estimation for Physics-based Human Motion Capture from Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07795v4)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion capture from monocular videos has made significant progress in recent years. However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g. in form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically plausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces and exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current state-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict torques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e. the joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical models, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end, we propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with the kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural Kalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to predict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a physics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to realize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and simulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show that this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps balancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important for not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing physically plausible human poses. The proposed approach excels in the physics-based human pose estimation task and demonstrates the physical plausibility of the predictive dynamics, compared to state of the art.

However, challenges such as pose ambiguity, data drift, and limited adaptability to diverse bodies persist. To address these issues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state estimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six integrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB sensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in resolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with anthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors are affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor data and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF iteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain human motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over state of the art in pose accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

We focus on four-way sleep position classification using data collected from a PSM placed under a mattress in a sleep clinic. Sleep positions can affect sleep quality and the prevalence of sleep disorders, such as apnea. Measurements were performed on patients with suspected sleep disorders referred for assessments at a sleep clinic. Training deep learning models can be challenging in clinical settings due to the need for large amounts of labeled data. To overcome the shortage of labeled training data, we utilize transfer learning to adapt pre-trained deep learning models to accurately estimate sleep positions from a low-resolution PSM dataset collected in a polysomnography sleep lab. Our approach leverages Vision Transformer models pre-trained on ImageNet using masked autoencoding (ViTMAE) and a pre-trained model for human pose estimation (ViTPose). These approaches outperform previous work from PSM-based sleep pose classification using deep learning (TCN) as well as traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) that use engineered features. We evaluate the performance of sleep position classification from 112 nights of patient recordings and validate it on a higher resolution 13-patient dataset. Despite the challenges of differentiating between sleep positions from low-resolution PSM data, our approach shows promise for real-world deployment in clinical settings</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference publication submitted to IEEE I2MTC 2025</p></details> |

Ergonomic assessments can mitigate these risks by identifying workplace adjustments that improve posture and reduce strain. Camera-based systems offer a non-intrusive, cost-effective method for continuous ergonomic tracking, but they also raise significant privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a privacy-aware ergonomic assessment framework utilizing machine learning techniques. Our approach employs adversarial training to develop a lightweight neural network that obfuscates video data, preserving only the essential information needed for human pose estimation. This obfuscation ensures compatibility with standard pose estimation algorithms, maintaining high accuracy while protecting privacy. The obfuscated video data is transmitted to a central server, where state-of-the-art keypoint detection algorithms extract body landmarks. Using multi-view integration, 3D keypoints are reconstructed and evaluated with the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) method. Our system provides a secure, effective solution for ergonomic monitoring in industrial environments, addressing both privacy and workplace safety concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 35th CIRP Design conference</p></details> |

Compared to vision-based systems, full-body pose estimation from sparse tracking signals is not limited by environmental conditions or recording range. However, previous works either face the challenge of wearing additional sensors on the pelvis and lower-body or rely on external visual sensors to obtain global positions of key joints. To improve the practicality of the technology for virtual reality applications, we estimate full-body poses using only inertial data obtained from three Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors worn on the head and wrists, thereby reducing the complexity of the hardware system. In this work, we propose a method called Progressive Inertial Poser (ProgIP) for human pose estimation, which combines neural network estimation with a human dynamics model, considers the hierarchical structure of the kinematic chain, and employs a multi-stage progressive network estimation with increased depth to reconstruct full-body motion in real time. The encoder combines Transformer Encoder and bidirectional LSTM (TE-biLSTM) to flexibly capture the temporal dependencies of the inertial sequence, while the decoder based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) transforms high-dimensional features and accurately projects them onto Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model parameters. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on multiple public datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the same inputs, and is comparable to recent works using six IMU sensors.</p></details> |  |

We propose a method that improves the performance of deep learning-based monocular 3D human pose estimation models by using multiview data only during training, but not during inference. We introduce a novel loss function, consistency loss, which operates on two synchronized views. This approach is simpler than previous models that require 3D ground truth or intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. Our consistency loss penalizes differences in two pose sequences after rigid alignment. We also demonstrate that our consistency loss substantially improves performance for fine-tuning without requiring 3D data. Furthermore, we show that using our consistency loss can yield state-of-the-art performance when training models from scratch in a semi-supervised manner. Our findings provide a simple way to capture new data, e.g in a new domain. This data can be added using off-the-shelf cameras with no calibration requirements.

It proposes a physical optimization scheme based on multiple contacts to enable physically plausible translation estimation in the full 3D space where the z-directional motion is usually challenging for previous works. It also considers gravity in local pose estimation which well constrains human global orientations and refines local pose estimation in a joint estimation manner. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate motion capture for both local poses and global motions. Furthermore, by deeply integrating physics, we can also estimate 3D contact, contact forces, joint torques, and interacting proxy surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025.

These developments have led to highly accurate body tracking systems, which have direct applications in sports analysis and performance evaluation. This work analyzes the performance of six trackers: two point trackers and four joint trackers for biomechanical analysis in sprints. The proposed framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames. The experimental framework employs forty sprints from five professional runners, focusing on three key angles in sprint biomechanics: trunk inclination, hip flex extension, and knee flex extension. We propose a post-processing module for outlier detection and fusion prediction in the joint angles. The experimental results demonstrate that using joint-based models yields root mean squared errors ranging from 11.41{\deg} to 4.37{\deg}. When integrated with the post-processing modules, these errors can be reduced to 6.99{\deg} and 3.88{\deg}, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that human pose tracking approaches can be valuable resources for the biomechanical analysis of running. However, there is still room for improvement in applications where high accuracy is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the paper presented to the Third Workshop on Learning with Few or Without Annotated Face, Body, and Gesture Data on 19th IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition 2025</p></details> |

While deep learning-based human pose estimation (HPE) models from RGB videos have achieved impressive performance on public datasets, their effectiveness in real-world sports scenarios is often hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts across different pose representations. Fine-tuning these models can partially alleviate such challenges but typically requires large-scale annotated data and still struggles to generalize across diverse sports environments. To address these limitations, we propose a 2D pose prior-guided refinement approach based on Neural Distance Fields (NDF). Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on angular representations of human poses, we introduce a polar coordinate-based representation that explicitly incorporates joint connection lengths, enabling a more accurate correction of erroneous pose estimations. Additionally, we define a novel non-geodesic distance metric that separates angular and radial discrepancies, which we demonstrate is better suited for polar representations than traditional geodesic distances. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a gradient-based batch-projection augmentation strategy, which synthesizes realistic pose samples through iterative refinement. Our method is evaluated on a long jump dataset, demonstrating its ability to improve 2D pose estimation across multiple pose representations, making it robust across different domains. Experimental results show that our approach enhances pose plausibility while requiring only limited training data.

Traditional regression-based methods assume fixed distributions, which might lead to poor UQ. Heatmap-based methods effectively model the output distribution using likelihood heatmaps, however, they demand significant resources. To address this, we propose Continuous Flow Residual Estimation (CFRE), an integration of Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) into regression-based models, which allows for dynamic distribution adaptation.

However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Each insole, fabricated with e-textile garment techniques, costs under USD 1, making it significantly cheaper than commercial alternatives and ideal for large-scale production. Our approach uses foot pressure distribution, acceleration, and rotation data to overcome limitations, providing a lightweight, minimally intrusive, and privacy-aware solution. The system employs a Transformer model for efficient temporal feature extraction, enriched by first and second derivatives in the input stream. Including multimodal information, such as accelerometers and rotational measurements, improves the accuracy of complex motion pattern recognition. These facts are demonstrated experimentally, while error metrics show the robustness of the approach in various posture estimation tasks.

| **[DDM: A Metric for Comparing 3D Shapes Using Directional Distance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09736v5)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Qualifying the discrepancy between 3D geometric models, which could be represented with either point clouds or triangle meshes, is a pivotal issue with board applications. Existing methods mainly focus on directly establishing the correspondence between two models and then aggregating point-wise distance between corresponding points, resulting in them being either inefficient or ineffective. In this paper, we propose DDM, an efficient, effective, robust, and differentiable distance metric for 3D geometry data. Specifically, we construct DDM based on the proposed implicit representation of 3D models, namely directional distance field (DDF), which defines the directional distances of 3D points to a model to capture its local surface geometry. We then transfer the discrepancy between two 3D geometric models as the discrepancy between their DDFs defined on an identical domain, naturally establishing model correspondence. To demonstrate the advantage of our DDM, we explore various distance metric-driven 3D geometric modeling tasks, including template surface fitting, rigid registration, non-rigid registration, scene flow estimation and human pose optimization. Extensive experiments show that our DDM achieves significantly higher accuracy under all tasks. As a generic distance metric, DDM has the potential to advance the field of 3D geometric modeling.

This study focuses on dance style recognition using features extracted using Laban Movement Analysis. Previous studies for dance style recognition often focus on cross-frame movement analysis, which limits the ability to capture temporal context and dynamic transitions between movements. This gap highlights the need for a method that can add temporal context to LMA features. For this, we introduce a novel pipeline which combines 3D pose estimation, 3D human mesh reconstruction, and floor aware body modeling to effectively extract LMA features. To address the temporal limitation, we propose a sliding window approach that captures movement evolution across time in features. These features are then used to train various machine learning methods for classification, and their explainability explainable AI methods to evaluate the contribution of each feature to classification performance. Our proposed method achieves a highest classification accuracy of 99.18\% which shows that the addition of temporal context significantly improves dance style recognition performance.</p></details> |  |

Many challenges make the reconstruction difficult due to (1) actors occluding with each other and having diverse facial expressions, (2) cluttered stages, and (3) small baseline views or sudden shot changes. To address these issues, we present ShowMak3r, a comprehensive reconstruction pipeline that allows the editing of scenes like how video clips are made in a production control room. In ShowMak3r, a 3DLocator module locates recovered actors on the stage using depth prior and estimates unseen human poses via interpolation. The proposed ShotMatcher module then tracks the actors under shot changes. Furthermore, ShowMak3r introduces a face-fitting network that dynamically recovers the actors' expressions. Experiments on Sitcoms3D dataset show that our pipeline can reassemble TV show scenes with new cameras at different timestamps. We also demonstrate that ShowMak3r enables interesting applications such as synthetic shot-making, actor relocation, insertion, deletion, and pose manipulation.

While existing research primarily focuses on reducing estimation errors, it largely neglects robustness and security aspects, leaving these systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To address this significant challenge, we propose the \textbf{Tangible Attack (TBA)}, a novel framework designed to generate adversarial examples capable of effectively compromising any digital human generation model. Our approach introduces a \textbf{Dual Heterogeneous Noise Generator (DHNG)}, which leverages Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and ControlNet to produce diverse, targeted noise tailored to the original image features. Additionally, we design a custom \textbf{adversarial loss function} to optimize the noise, ensuring both high controllability and potent disruption. By iteratively refining the adversarial sample through multi-gradient signals from both the noise and the state-of-the-art EHPS model, TBA substantially improves the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate TBA's superiority, achieving a remarkable 41.0\% increase in estimation error, with an average improvement of approximately 17.0\%. These findings expose significant security vulnerabilities in current EHPS models and highlight the need for stronger defenses in digital human generation systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

In this study, we proposed a novel architecture named Transformer based Encoder Decoder Network (TED Net) designed for estimating human skeleton poses from WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). TED Net integrates convolutional encoders with transformer based attention mechanisms to capture spatiotemporal features from CSI signals. The estimated skeleton poses were used as input to a customized Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) for action recognition. We validated our model on two datasets: a publicly available multi modal dataset for assessing general pose estimation, and a newly collected dataset focused on fall related scenarios involving 20 participants. Experimental results demonstrated that TED Net outperformed existing approaches in pose estimation, and that the DGNN achieves reliable action classification using CSI based skeletons, with performance comparable to RGB based systems. Notably, TED Net maintains robust performance across both fall and non fall cases. These findings highlight the potential of CSI driven human skeleton estimation for effective action recognition, particularly in home environments such as elderly fall detection. In such settings, WiFi signals are often readily available, offering a privacy preserving alternative to vision based methods, which may raise concerns about continuous camera monitoring.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Although utilizing facial landmarks is valuable for this purpose, existing landmark-based methods prioritize precision over simplicity and model size, limiting their deployment on edge devices and in compute-poor environments. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Grouped Attention Deep Sets (GADS)}, a novel architecture based on the Deep Set framework. By grouping landmarks into regions and employing small Deep Set layers, we reduce computational complexity. Our multihead attention mechanism extracts and combines inter-group information, resulting in a model that is $7.5\times$ smaller and executes $25\times$ faster than the current lightest state-of-the-art model. Notably, our method achieves an impressive reduction, being $4321\times$ smaller than the best-performing model. We introduce vanilla GADS and Hybrid-GADS (landmarks + RGB) and evaluate our models on three benchmark datasets -- AFLW2000, BIWI, and 300W-LP. We envision our architecture as a robust baseline for resource-constrained head pose estimation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 tables, 10 figures, not submitted to any conference or journal</p></details> |

Recent neural rendering advances have enabled holistic human-scene reconstruction but require pre-calibrated camera and human poses, and days of training time. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality. Experiments on the EMDB and NeuMan datasets demonstrate superior or on-par performance with existing methods in camera tracking, human pose estimation, novel view synthesis and runtime.

Among these factors, camera viewpoints and locations {have been shown} to contribute significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained model.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, including appendix.

However, as these techniques migrate towards lower-fidelity IMUs on ubiquitous commodity devices, like phones, watches, and earbuds, challenges arise including compromised online performance, temporal consistency, and loss of global translation due to sensor noise and drift. Addressing these challenges, we introduce MobilePoser, a real-time system for full-body pose and global translation estimation using any available subset of IMUs already present in these consumer devices. MobilePoser employs a multi-stage deep neural network for kinematic pose estimation followed by a physics-based motion optimizer, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while remaining lightweight. We conclude with a series of demonstrative applications to illustrate the unique potential of MobilePoser across a variety of fields, such as health and wellness, gaming, and indoor navigation to name a few.</p></details> |  |
| **[GST: Precise 3D Human Body from a Single Image with Gaussian Splatting Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04196v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing posed 3D human models from monocular images has important applications in the sports industry, including performance tracking, injury prevention and virtual training. In this work, we combine 3D human pose and shape estimation with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a representation of the scene composed of a mixture of Gaussians. This allows training or fine-tuning a human model predictor on multi-view images alone, without 3D ground truth. Predicting such mixtures for a human from a single input image is challenging due to self-occlusions and dependence on articulations, while also needing to retain enough flexibility to accommodate a variety of clothes and poses. Our key observation is that the vertices of standardized human meshes (such as SMPL) can provide an adequate spatial density and approximate initial position for the Gaussians. We can then train a transformer model to jointly predict comparatively small adjustments to these positions, as well as the other 3DGS attributes and the SMPL parameters. We show empirically that this combination (using only multi-view supervision) can achieve near real-time inference of 3D human models from a single image without expensive diffusion models or 3D points supervision, thus making it ideal for the sport industry at any level. More importantly, rendering is an effective auxiliary objective to refine 3D pose estimation by accounting for clothes and other geometric variations.

Users have the possibility to access the entire Mixed Reality (MR) continuum. Goal of the human-computer-interaction (HCI) community is to allow natural and intuitive interactions but in general interactions for XR often rely on handheld controllers. One natural interaction method is full body tracking (FBT), where a user can use their body to interact with the experience. Classically, FBT systems require markers or trackers on the users to capture motion. Recently, there have been approaches based on Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which highlight the potential of low-cost non-intrusive FBT for XR. Due to the lack of handheld devices, HPE may also improve accessibility with people struggling with traditional input methods. This paper proposes the concept of non-intrusive FBT for XR for all.

However, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present significant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional anonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data utility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal privacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied naively. In this work, we present the first differentially private 2D human pose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance, we adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace. Additionally, we adapt TinyViT, a compact and efficient vision transformer for coordinate classification in HPE, providing a lightweight yet powerful backbone that enhances privacy-preserving deployment feasibility on resource-limited devices. Our approach is particularly valuable for multimedia interpretation tasks, enabling privacy-safe analysis and understanding of human motion across diverse visual media while preserving the semantic meaning required for downstream applications. Comprehensive experiments on the MPII Human Pose Dataset demonstrate significant performance enhancement with PDP-SGD achieving 78.48% PCKh@0.5 at a strict privacy budget ($\epsilon=0.2$), compared to 63.85% for standard DP-SGD. This work lays foundation for privacy-preserving human pose estimation in real-world, sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |

Advancements in neural networks have significantly alleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports broadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it depends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive game analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match recordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to identify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's flying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying on human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or unavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration method capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted an existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to accurately track player movements. Together, these contributions enable the full 3D reconstruction of a table tennis rally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVSport 2025</p></details> |

However, most SOTA human mesh estimation (HME) models output a slightly different, thus inconsistent basic body shape for each video frame. Furthermore, we find that SOTA 3D human pose estimation (HPE) models outperform HME models regarding the precision of the estimated 3D keypoint positions. We solve the problem of inconsistent body shapes by leveraging anthropometric measurements like taken by tailors from humans. We create a model called A2B that converts given anthropometric measurements to basic body shape parameters of human mesh models. We obtain superior and consistent human meshes by combining the A2B model results with the keypoints of 3D HPE models using inverse kinematics. We evaluate our approach on challenging datasets like ASPset or fit3D, where we can lower the MPJPE by over 30 mm compared to SOTA HME models. Further, replacing estimates of the body shape parameters from existing HME models with A2B results not only increases the performance of these HME models, but also guarantees consistent body shapes.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for CVSports@CVPR'25</p></details> |

While Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) models can estimate joint rotations, they often exhibit lower accuracy in joint localization compared to 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) models. Recent work addressed this limitation by combining a 3D HPE model with inverse kinematics (IK) to estimate both joint locations and rotations. However, IK is computationally expensive. To overcome this, we propose a novel 2D-to-3D uplifting model that directly estimates 3D human poses, including joint rotations, in a single forward pass. We investigate multiple rotation representations, loss functions, and training strategies - both with and without access to ground truth rotations. Our models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in rotation estimation, are 150 times faster than the IK-based approach, and surpass HMR models in joint localization precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at CVSports@CVPR'25</p></details> |

Existing methods predominantly rely on Transformer-based architectures, which suffer from quadratic complexity in self-attention, leading to substantial computational overhead, especially in multi-person scenarios. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative to Transformers due to its efficient global modeling capability. However, it remains limited in capturing fine-grained local dependencies, which are essential for precise EHPS. To address these issues, we propose EMO-X, the Efficient Multi-person One-stage model for multi-person EHPS.

While existing approaches primarily aim to enhance the performance of estimated 2D poses, they often struggle when applied to ground-truth 2D pose data. We observe that achieving accurate 3D pose reconstruction from ground-truth 2D poses requires precise modeling of local pose structures, alongside the ability to extract robust global spatio-temporal features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Hyper-GCN and Shuffle Mamba (HGMamba) block, which processes input data through two parallel streams: Hyper-GCN and Shuffle-Mamba. The Hyper-GCN stream models the human body structure as hypergraphs with varying levels of granularity to effectively capture local joint dependencies. Meanwhile, the Shuffle Mamba stream leverages a state space model to perform spatio-temporal scanning across all joints, enabling the establishment of global dependencies. By adaptively fusing these two representations, HGMamba achieves strong global feature modeling while excelling at local structure modeling. We stack multiple HGMamba blocks to create three variants of our model, allowing users to select the most suitable configuration based on the desired speed-accuracy trade-off. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Despite significant progress in pose estimation algorithms targeting adults, such developments for infants remain limited. Existing algorithms for infant pose estimation, despite achieving commendable performance, depend on fully supervised approaches that require large amounts of labeled data.

To address these challenges, we introduce SHIFT: Leveraging SyntHetic Adult Datasets for Unsupervised InFanT Pose Estimation, which leverages the pseudo-labeling-based Mean-Teacher framework to compensate for the lack of labeled data and addresses distribution shifts by enforcing consistency between the student and the teacher pseudo-labels. Additionally, to penalize implausible predictions obtained from the mean-teacher framework, we incorporate an infant manifold pose prior. To enhance SHIFT's self-occlusion perception ability, we propose a novel visibility consistency module for improved alignment of the predicted poses with the original image.

To address this issue, this study proposes a novel cooperative inference method for real-time 3D human pose estimation in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. In the proposed method, multiple end devices equipped with lightweight inference models employ dual confidence thresholds to filter ambiguous images. Only the filtered images are offloaded to an edge server with a more powerful inference model for re-evaluation, thereby improving the estimation accuracy under computational and communication constraints. We numerically analyze the performance of the proposed inference method in terms of the inference accuracy and end-to-end delay and formulate a joint optimization problem to derive the optimal confidence thresholds and transmission time for each device, with the objective of minimizing the mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) while satisfying the required end-to-end delay constraint. To solve this problem, we demonstrate that minimizing the MPJPE is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the inference accuracies for all devices, decompose the problem into manageable subproblems, and present a low-complexity optimization algorithm to obtain a near-optimal solution. The experimental results show that a trade-off exists between the MPJPE and end-to-end delay depending on the confidence thresholds. Furthermore, the results confirm that the proposed cooperative inference method achieves a significant reduction in the MPJPE through the optimal selection of confidence thresholds and transmission times, while consistently satisfying the end-to-end delay requirement in various MEC environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |

Monocular 3D human pose estimation is challenged by depth ambiguity, limited 3D-labeled training data, imbalanced modeling, and restricted model generalization. To address these limitations, our work introduces a groundbreaking motion pre-training method based on contextualized representation learning. Specifically, our method involves masking 2D pose features and utilizing a Transformer-GCN dual-stream model to learn high-dimensional representations through a self-distillation setup. By focusing on contextualized representation learning and spatial-temporal modeling, our approach enhances the model's ability to understand spatial-temporal relationships between postures, resulting in superior generalization. Furthermore, leveraging the Transformer-GCN dual-stream model, our approach effectively balances global and local interactions in video pose estimation. The model adaptively integrates information from both the Transformer and GCN streams, where the GCN stream effectively learns local relationships between adjacent key points and frames, while the Transformer stream captures comprehensive global spatial and temporal features. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, with an MPJPE of 38.0mm and P-MPJPE of 31.9mm on Human3.6M, and an MPJPE of 15.9mm on MPI-INF-3DHP. Furthermore, visual experiments on public datasets and in-the-wild videos demonstrate the robustness and generalization capabilities of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiPART: Hierarchical Pose AutoRegressive Transformer for Occluded 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23331v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 2D-to-3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods struggle with the occlusion issue by enriching information like temporal and visual cues in the lifting stage. In this paper, we argue that these methods ignore the limitation of the sparse skeleton 2D input representation, which fundamentally restricts the 2D-to-3D lifting and worsens the occlusion issue. To address these, we propose a novel two-stage generative densification method, named Hierarchical Pose AutoRegressive Transformer (HiPART), to generate hierarchical 2D dense poses from the original sparse 2D pose. Specifically, we first develop a multi-scale skeleton tokenization module to quantize the highly dense 2D pose into hierarchical tokens and propose a Skeleton-aware Alignment to strengthen token connections. We then develop a Hierarchical AutoRegressive Modeling scheme for hierarchical 2D pose generation. With generated hierarchical poses as inputs for 2D-to-3D lifting, the proposed method shows strong robustness in occluded scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-frame-based 3D HPE. Moreover, it outperforms numerous multi-frame methods while reducing parameter and computational complexity and can also complement them to further enhance performance and robustness.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

However,most of the existing methods are computationally expensive or have complex architecture. Here we propose a lightweight attention based pose estimation network that utilizes depthwise separable convolution and Convolutional Block Attention Module on an hourglass backbone. The network significantly reduces the computational complexity (floating point operations) and the model size (number of parameters) containing only about 10% of parameters of original eight stack Hourglass network. Experiments were conducted on COCO and MPII datasets using a two stack hourglass backbone. The results showed that our model performs well in comparison to six other lightweight pose estimation models with an average precision of 72.07. The model achieves this performance with only 2.3M parameters and 3.7G FLOPs.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods depend on specialized equipment such as force plates and sensors, which makes accurate assessments both expensive and restricted to laboratory settings. In this paper, we introduce ForcePose, a novel deep learning framework that estimates applied forces by combining human pose estimation with object detection. Our approach leverages MediaPipe for skeletal tracking and SSD MobileNet for object recognition to create a unified representation of human-object interaction. We've developed a specialized neural network that processes both spatial and temporal features to predict force magnitude and direction without needing any physical sensors. After training on our dataset of 850 annotated videos with corresponding force measurements, our model achieves a mean absolute error of 5.83 N in force magnitude and 7.4 degrees in force direction. When compared to existing computer vision approaches, our method performs 27.5% better while still offering real-time performance on standard computing hardware. ForcePose opens up new possibilities for force analysis in diverse real-world scenarios where traditional measurement tools are impractical or intrusive. This paper discusses our methodology, the dataset creation process, evaluation metrics, and potential applications across rehabilitation, ergonomics assessment, and athletic performance analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, patients' engagement tends to decrease over time without direct supervision, which is why there is a need for an automated monitoring system. In recent years, there has been great progress in quality assessment of physical rehabilitation exercises. Most of them only provide a binary classification if the performance is correct or incorrect, and a few provide a continuous score. This information is not sufficient for patients to improve their performance. In this work, we propose an algorithm for error classification of rehabilitation exercises, thus making the first step toward more detailed feedback to patients. We focus on skeleton-based exercise assessment, which utilizes human pose estimation to evaluate motion. Inspired by recent algorithms for quality assessment during rehabilitation exercises, we propose a Transformer-based model for the described classification. Our model is inspired by the HyperFormer method for human action recognition, and adapted to our problem and dataset. The evaluation is done on the KERAAL dataset, as it is the only medical dataset with clear error labels for the exercises, and our model significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we bridge the gap towards better feedback to the patients by presenting a way to calculate the importance of joints for each exercise.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICORR...</summary><p>ICORR 2025 - 19th IEEE/RAS-EMBS International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics, INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM FOR REHABILITATION ROBOTICS, May 2025, Michigan, USA, United States</p></details> |

However, SAM incurs twice the computational cost compared to base optimizer (e.g., SGD). We propose Asymptotic Unbiased Sampling with respect to iterations to accelerate SAM (AUSAM), which maintains the model's generalization capacity while significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Concretely, we probabilistically sample a subset of data points beneficial for SAM optimization based on a theoretically guaranteed criterion, i.e., the Gradient Norm of each Sample (GNS). We further approximate the GNS by the difference in loss values before and after perturbation in SAM. As a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic method, our approach consistently accelerates SAM across a range of tasks and networks, i.e., classification, human pose estimation and network quantization. On CIFAR10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet, AUSAM achieves results comparable to SAM while providing a speedup of over 70%. Compared to recent dynamic data pruning methods, AUSAM is better suited for SAM and excels in maintaining performance. Additionally, AUSAM accelerates optimization in human pose estimation and model quantization without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we train a transformer that takes an image as input and estimates the parameters of the model. Due to the lack of training data for this task, we build a pipeline to produce pseudo ground truth model parameters for single images and implement a training procedure that iteratively refines these pseudo labels. Compared to state-of-the-art methods for 3D human mesh recovery, our model achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, while it significantly outperforms them in settings with extreme 3D poses and viewpoints. Additionally, we show that previous reconstruction methods frequently violate joint angle limits, leading to unnatural rotations. In contrast, our approach leverages the biomechanically plausible degrees of freedom making more realistic joint rotation estimates. We validate our approach across multiple human pose estimation benchmarks.

| **[Zero-Shot Human-Object Interaction Synthesis with Multimodal Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20118v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-object interaction (HOI) synthesis is important for various applications, ranging from virtual reality to robotics. However, acquiring 3D HOI data is challenging due to its complexity and high cost, limiting existing methods to the narrow diversity of object types and interaction patterns in training datasets. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot HOI synthesis framework without relying on end-to-end training on currently limited 3D HOI datasets. The core idea of our method lies in leveraging extensive HOI knowledge from pre-trained Multimodal Models. Given a text description, our system first obtains temporally consistent 2D HOI image sequences using image or video generation models, which are then uplifted to 3D HOI milestones of human and object poses. We employ pre-trained human pose estimation models to extract human poses and introduce a generalizable category-level 6-DoF estimation method to obtain the object poses from 2D HOI images. Our estimation method is adaptive to various object templates obtained from text-to-3D models or online retrieval. A physics-based tracking of the 3D HOI kinematic milestone is further applied to refine both body motions and object poses, yielding more physically plausible HOI generation results. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating open-vocabulary HOIs with physical realism and semantic diversity.</p></details> |  |

There is rapid development of human pose estimation methods in computer vision thanks to advances in deep learning and machine learning. However, these methods are trained on datasets that feature adults in different contexts. This work tests and compares seven popular methods (AlphaPose, DeepLabCut/DeeperCut, Detectron2, HRNet, MediaPipe/BlazePose, OpenPose, and ViTPose) on videos of infants in supine position and in more complex settings. Surprisingly, all methods except DeepLabCut and MediaPipe have competitive performance without additional finetuning, with ViTPose performing best. Next to standard performance metrics (average precision and recall), we introduce errors expressed in the neck-mid-hip (torso length) ratio and additionally study missed and redundant detections, and the reliability of the internal confidence ratings of the different methods, which are relevant for downstream tasks. Among the networks with competitive performance, only AlphaPose could run close to real time (27 fps) on our machine. We provide documented Docker containers or instructions for all the methods we used, our analysis scripts, and the processed data at https://hub.docker.com/u/humanoidsctu and https://osf.io/x465b/.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 20 tables</p></details> |

Since calibrating multiple cameras and finding matches across their views are inherently interdependent, performing both in a unified framework poses a significant challenge. We address these issues as a single registration problem of matching two sets of 3D points, leveraging human motion in dynamic multi-person scenes. To this end, we utilize 3D human poses obtained from an off-the-shelf monocular 3D human pose estimator and transform them into 3D points on a unit sphere, to solve the rotation, time offset, and the association alternatingly. We employ a probabilistic approach that can jointly solve both problems of aligning spatiotemporal data and establishing correspondences through soft assignment between two views. The translation is determined by applying coplanarity constraints. The pairwise registration results are integrated into a multiview setup, and then a nonlinear optimization method is used to improve the accuracy of the camera poses, temporal offsets, and multi-person associations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method as a practical marker-free calibration tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Primarily, this comparative analysis aims to validate the use of marker-less MoCap techniques in a clinical setting by showing that these marker-less techniques are within a reasonable range for kinematics analysis compared to the more cumbersome and less portable state-of-the-art tools. Not only does marker-less motion capture using human pose estimation produce results in-line with the results of both the IMU and MoCap kinematics but also benefits from a reduced set-up time and reduced practical knowledge and expertise to set up. Overall, while there is still room for improvement when it comes to the quality of the data produced, we believe that this compromise is within the room of error that these low-speed actions that are used in small clinical tests.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Sparse Correlation and Joint Distillation (SCJD), a novel framework that balances efficiency and accuracy for 3D HPE. SCJD introduces Sparse Correlation Input Sequence Downsampling to reduce redundancy in student network inputs while preserving inter-frame correlations. For effective knowledge transfer, we propose Dynamic Joint Spatial Attention Distillation, which includes Dynamic Joint Embedding Distillation to enhance the student's feature representation using the teacher's multi-frame context feature, and Adjacent Joint Attention Distillation to improve the student network's focus on adjacent joint relationships for better spatial understanding. Additionally, Temporal Consistency Distillation aligns the temporal correlations between teacher and student networks through upsampling and global supervision.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed mentor-student relationships, our framework dynamically selects and adapts the teaching strategies of diverse mentors based on their effectiveness for each data sample. ClassroomKD comprises two main modules: the Knowledge Filtering (KF) module and the Mentoring module. The KF Module dynamically ranks mentors based on their performance for each input, activating only high-quality mentors to minimize error accumulation and prevent information loss. The Mentoring Module adjusts the distillation strategy by tuning each mentor's influence according to the dynamic performance gap between the student and mentors, effectively modulating the learning pace. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and 2D human pose estimation (COCO Keypoints and MPII Human Pose) demonstrate that ClassroomKD outperforms existing knowledge distillation methods for different network architectures. Our results highlight that a dynamic and adaptive approach to mentor selection and guidance leads to more effective knowledge transfer, paving the way for enhanced model performance through distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IntelliSys 2025</p></details> |

Traditional gun detection methods rely on manual inspections and continuous human monitoring of CCTV footage, which are labor-intensive and prone to high false positive and negative rates. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates human pose estimation with weapon appearance recognition using deep learning techniques. Unlike prior studies that focus on either body pose estimation or firearm detection in isolation, our method jointly analyzes posture and weapon presence to enhance detection accuracy in real-world, dynamic environments. To train our model, we curated a diverse dataset comprising images from open-source repositories such as IMFDB and Monash Guns, supplemented with AI-generated and manually collected images from web sources. This dataset ensures robust generalization and realistic performance evaluation under various surveillance conditions. Our research aims to improve the precision and reliability of firearm detection systems, contributing to enhanced public safety and threat mitigation in high-risk areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring Your Rear Cameras for Egocentric 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11652v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric 3D human pose estimation has been actively studied using cameras installed in front of a head-mounted device (HMD). While frontal placement is the optimal and the only option for some tasks, such as hand tracking, it remains unclear if the same holds for full-body tracking due to self-occlusion and limited field-of-view coverage. Notably, even the state-of-the-art methods often fail to estimate accurate 3D poses in many scenarios, such as when HMD users tilt their heads upward (a common motion in human activities). A key limitation of existing HMD designs is their neglect of the back of the body, despite its potential to provide crucial 3D reconstruction cues. Hence, this paper investigates the usefulness of rear cameras in the HMD design for full-body tracking. We also show that simply adding rear views to the frontal inputs is not optimal for existing methods due to their dependence on individual 2D joint detectors without effective multi-view integration. To address this issue, we propose a new transformer-based method that refines 2D joint heatmap estimation with multi-view information and heatmap uncertainty, thereby improving 3D pose tracking. Moreover, we introduce two new large-scale datasets, Ego4View-Syn and Ego4View-RW, for a rear-view evaluation. Our experiments show that the new camera configurations with back views provide superior support for 3D pose tracking compared to only frontal placements. The proposed method achieves significant improvement over the current state of the art (>10% on MPJPE).

Ground truth 2D poses are used for adaptation, but only estimated 2D poses are available in practice. This paper addresses adapting models to streaming videos with estimated 2D poses. Comparing adaptations reveals the challenge of limiting estimation errors while preserving accurate pose information. To this end, we propose adaptive aggregation, a two-stage optimization, and local augmentation for handling varying levels of estimated pose error. First, we perform adaptive aggregation across videos to initialize the model state with labeled representative samples. Within each video, we use a two-stage optimization to benefit from 2D fitting while minimizing the impact of erroneous updates. Second, we employ local augmentation, using adjacent confident samples to update the model before adapting to the current non-confident sample. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art by a large margin, advancing adaptation towards more practical settings of using estimated 2D poses.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenHPE: Generative Counterfactuals for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Radio Frequency Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09537v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation (HPE) detects the positions of human body joints for various applications. Compared to using cameras, HPE using radio frequency (RF) signals is non-intrusive and more robust to adverse conditions, exploiting the signal variations caused by human interference. However, existing studies focus on single-domain HPE confined by domain-specific confounders, which cannot generalize to new domains and result in diminished HPE performance. Specifically, the signal variations caused by different human body parts are entangled, containing subject-specific confounders. RF signals are also intertwined with environmental noise, involving environment-specific confounders. In this paper, we propose GenHPE, a 3D HPE approach that generates counterfactual RF signals to eliminate domain-specific confounders. GenHPE trains generative models conditioned on human skeleton labels, learning how human body parts and confounders interfere with RF signals. We manipulate skeleton labels (i.e., removing body parts) as counterfactual conditions for generative models to synthesize counterfactual RF signals. The differences between counterfactual signals approximately eliminate domain-specific confounders and regularize an encoder-decoder model to learn domain-independent representations. Such representations help GenHPE generalize to new subjects/environments for cross-domain 3D HPE. We evaluate GenHPE on three public datasets from WiFi, ultra-wideband, and millimeter wave. Experimental results show that GenHPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces estimation errors by up to 52.2mm for cross-subject HPE and 10.6mm for cross-environment HPE.</p></details> |  |

Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models.

While prior art usually solves these problems separately, we argue that joint optimization of skeletal motion with a 3D renderable body model brings synergistic effects, i.e. yields more precise motion capture and improved visual quality of real-time rendering of avatars. To achieve this, we introduce a novel animatable avatar with 3D Gaussians rigged on a personalized mesh and propose to optimize the motion sequence with time-dependent MLPs that provide accurate and temporally consistent pose estimates. We first evaluate our method on highly challenging yoga poses and demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on multi-view human pose estimation, reducing error by 35% on body joints and 45% on hand joints compared to keypoint-based methods. At the same time, our method significantly boosts the visual quality of animatable avatars (+2dB PSNR on novel view synthesis) on diverse challenging subjects.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Existing methods always struggle with either low rendering qualities (\eg, visual fidelity and physically plausible HOIs) or high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose HOGS (Human-Object Rendering via 3D Gaussian Splatting), a novel framework for efficient and physically plausible HOI rendering from sparse views. Specifically, HOGS combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with a physics-aware optimization process. It incorporates a Human Pose Refinement module for accurate pose estimation and a Sparse-View Human-Object Contact Prediction module for efficient contact region identification. This combination enables coherent joint rendering of human and object Gaussians while enforcing physically plausible interactions. Extensive experiments on the HODome dataset demonstrate that HOGS achieves superior rendering quality, efficiency, and physical plausibility compared to existing methods. We further show its extensibility to hand-object grasp rendering tasks, presenting its broader applicability to articulated object interactions.</p></details> |  |

While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%. We also validate the kinematic accuracy of monocular pose estimations through waveform analysis, highlighting strong correlations in joint angle estimations but limitations in velocity estimation. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of monocular pose estimation models in the context of sports, contributing valuable insights for advancing monocular pose estimation techniques in high-performance sports environments.

Such long-sequence in-the-wild motions are highly valuable to applications such as motion generation and motion understanding, but are of great challenge to be recovered due to abrupt shot transitions, partial occlusions, and dynamic backgrounds presented in such videos. Existing methods primarily focus on single-shot videos, where continuity is maintained within a single camera view, or simplify multi-shot alignment in camera space only. In this work, we tackle the challenges by integrating an enhanced camera pose estimation with Human Motion Recovery (HMR) by incorporating a shot transition detector and a robust alignment module for accurate pose and orientation continuity across shots. By leveraging a custom motion integrator, we effectively mitigate the problem of foot sliding and ensure temporal consistency in human pose. Extensive evaluations on our created multi-shot dataset from public 3D human datasets demonstrate the robustness of our method in reconstructing realistic human motion in world coordinates.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project page: https://zhangyuhong01.github.io/HumanMM/</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel implicit approach for jointly reconstructing realistic 3D clothed humans and objects from a monocular view. For the first time, we model both the human and the object with an implicit representation, allowing to capture more realistic details such as clothing. This task is extremely challenging due to human-object occlusions and the lack of 3D information in 2D images, often leading to poor detail reconstruction and depth ambiguity. To address these problems, we propose a novel attention-based neural implicit model that leverages image pixel alignment from both the input human-object image for a global understanding of the human-object scene and from local separate views of the human and object images to improve realism with, for example, clothing details. Additionally, the network is conditioned on semantic features derived from an estimated human-object pose prior, which provides 3D spatial information about the shared space of humans and objects. To handle human occlusion caused by objects, we use a generative diffusion model that inpaints the occluded regions, recovering otherwise lost details. For training and evaluation, we introduce a synthetic dataset featuring rendered scenes of inter-occluded 3D human scans and diverse objects. Extensive evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates the superior quality of the proposed human-object reconstructions over competitive methods.</p></details> |  |

The input constraints are often not satisfied in real-world setups, making the approach impractical. We show that unsynchronized videos from unknown poses can generate dynamic neural fields as long as the videos capture human motion. Humans are one of the most common dynamic subjects captured in videos, and their shapes and poses can be estimated using state-of-the-art libraries. While noisy, the estimated human shape and pose parameters provide a decent initialization point to start the highly non-convex and under-constrained problem of training a consistent dynamic neural representation. Given the shape and pose parameters of humans in individual frames, we formulate methods to calculate the time offsets between videos, followed by camera pose estimations that analyze the 3D joint positions. Then, we train the dynamic neural fields employing multiresolution grids while we concurrently refine both time offsets and camera poses. The setup still involves optimizing many parameters; therefore, we introduce a robust progressive learning strategy to stabilize the process. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate spatio-temporal calibration and high-quality scene reconstruction in challenging conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, current Transformer-based methods for video pose estimation often face challenges in managing redundant temporal information and achieving fine-grained perception because they only focus on processing low-resolution features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale resolution framework that encodes spatio-temporal representations at varying granularities and executes fine-grained perception compensation. Furthermore, we employ a density peaks clustering method to dynamically identify and prioritize tokens that offer important semantic information. This strategy effectively prunes redundant feature tokens, especially those arising from multi-frame features, thereby optimizing computational efficiency without sacrificing semantic richness. Empirically, it sets new benchmarks for both performance and efficiency on three large-scale datasets. Our method achieves a 93.8% improvement in inference speed compared to the baseline, while also enhancing pose estimation accuracy, reaching 87.4 mAP on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing approaches that significantly limit practicality by employing intrusive chirp signals within the audible range, our method utilizes natural music that causes minimal discomfort to humans. Estimating human poses from standard music presents significant challenges. In contrast to sound sources specifically designed for measurement, regular music varies in both volume and pitch. These dynamic changes in signals caused by music are inevitably mixed with alterations in the sound field resulting from human motion, making it hard to extract reliable cues for pose estimation. To address these challenges, BGM2Pose introduces a Contrastive Pose Extraction Module that employs contrastive learning and hard negative sampling to eliminate musical components from the recorded data, isolating the pose information. Additionally, we propose a Frequency-wise Attention Module that enables the model to focus on subtle acoustic variations attributable to human movement by dynamically computing attention across frequency bands. Experiments suggest that our method outperforms the existing methods, demonstrating substantial potential for real-world applications. Our datasets and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving a good balance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness remains a challenge. For instance, CNNs are computationally efficient but struggle with long-range dependencies, while ViTs excel in capturing such dependencies but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper proposes two ViT-based models for accurate, efficient, and robust 2D pose estimation. The first one, EViTPose, operates in a computationally efficient manner without sacrificing accuracy by utilizing learnable joint tokens to select and process a subset of the most important body patches, enabling us to control the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency by changing the number of patches to be processed. The second one, UniTransPose, while not allowing for the same level of direct control over the trade-off, efficiently handles multiple scales by combining (1) an efficient multi-scale transformer encoder that uses both local and global attention with (2) an efficient sub-pixel CNN decoder for better speed and accuracy. Moreover, by incorporating all joints from different benchmarks into a unified skeletal representation, we train robust methods that learn from multiple datasets simultaneously and perform well across a range of scenarios -- including pose variations, lighting conditions, and occlusions. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods while improving computational efficiency. EViTPose exhibits a significant decrease in computational complexity (30% to 44% less in GFLOPs) with a minimal drop of accuracy (0% to 3.5% less), and UniTransPose achieves accuracy improvements ranging from 0.9% to 43.8% across these benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel video segmentation strategy to extract frames of each player's racket swing in a badminton broadcast match. These segmented frames are then processed by two existing models: one for Human Pose Estimation to obtain player skeletal joints, and the other for shuttlecock trajectory detection to extract shuttlecock trajectories. Leveraging these joints, trajectories, and player positions as inputs, we propose Badminton Stroke-type Transformer (BST) to classify player stroke-types in singles. To the best of our knowledge, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the largest publicly available badminton video dataset, ShuttleSet, which shows that effectively leveraging ball trajectory is likely to be a trend for racket sports action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (excluding references).

In these scenarios, robots rely on a multitude of state-of-the-art detectors usually designed to operate with RGB-D cameras or expensive 3D LiDARs. However, most commercially available service robots are equipped with cameras with a narrow field of view, making them blind when a user is approaching from other directions, or inexpensive 1D LiDARs whose readings are difficult to interpret. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised approach to detect humans and estimate their 2D pose from 1D LiDAR data, using detections from an RGB-D camera as a supervision source. Our approach aims to provide service robots with spatial awareness of nearby humans. After training on 70 minutes of data autonomously collected in two environments, our model is capable of detecting humans omnidirectionally from 1D LiDAR data in a novel environment, with 71% precision and 80% recall, while retaining an average absolute error of 13 cm in distance and 44{\deg} in orientation.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Transformer-based 3D HPE backbones often encounter a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. To resolve the above dilemma, in this work, we leverage recent advances in state space models and utilize Mamba for high-quality and efficient long-range modeling. Nonetheless, Mamba still faces challenges in precisely exploiting local dependencies between joints. To address these issues, we propose a new attention-free hybrid spatiotemporal architecture named Hybrid Mamba-GCN (Pose Magic). This architecture introduces local enhancement with GCN by capturing relationships between neighboring joints, thus producing new representations to complement Mamba's outputs. By adaptively fusing representations from Mamba and GCN, Pose Magic demonstrates superior capability in learning the underlying 3D structure. To meet the requirements of real-time inference, we also provide a fully causal version. Extensive experiments show that Pose Magic achieves new SOTA results ($\downarrow 0.9 mm$) while saving $74.1\%$ FLOPs. In addition, Pose Magic exhibits optimal motion consistency and the ability to generalize to unseen sequence lengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

We argue that the increasing miniaturization of optical sensors will lead to the prolific integration of cameras into many more body-worn devices at various locations. This will bring fresh perspectives to established tasks in computer vision and benefit key areas such as human motion tracking, body pose estimation, or action recognition -- particularly for the lower body, which is typically occluded. In this paper, we introduce EgoSim, a novel simulator of body-worn cameras that generates realistic egocentric renderings from multiple perspectives across a wearer's body. A key feature of EgoSim is its use of real motion capture data to render motion artifacts, which are especially noticeable with arm- or leg-worn cameras. In addition, we introduce MultiEgoView, a dataset of egocentric footage from six body-worn cameras and ground-truth full-body 3D poses during several activities: 119 hours of data are derived from AMASS motion sequences in four high-fidelity virtual environments, which we augment with 5 hours of real-world motion data from 13 participants using six GoPro cameras and 3D body pose references from an Xsens motion capture suit. We demonstrate EgoSim's effectiveness by training an end-to-end video-only 3D pose estimation network. Analyzing its domain gap, we show that our dataset and simulator substantially aid training for inference on real-world data.

However, most existing methods do not operate well for testing images whose distribution is far from that of training data. This problem might be alleviated by involving diverse data during training, however it is non-trivial to collect such diverse data with corresponding labels (i.e. 3D pose). In this paper, we introduced an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 3D pose estimation that utilizes the unlabeled data in addition to labeled data via masked image modeling (MIM) framework. Foreground-centric reconstruction and attention regularization are further proposed to increase the effectiveness of unlabeled data usage. Experiments are conducted on the various datasets in human and hand pose estimation tasks, especially using the cross-domain scenario.

To predict a single output 3D pose sequence, we generate and aggregate multiple 3D pose hypotheses. For better aggregation results, we develop a method to score these hypotheses during training, effectively integrating conformal prediction into the learning process. This process results in a differentiable conformal predictor that is trained end2end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned scoring model is used as the conformity score, and the 3D pose estimator is combined with a conformal predictor to select the most accurate hypotheses for downstream aggregation. Our results indicate that using a simple mean aggregation on the conformal prediction-filtered hypotheses set yields competitive results. When integrated with more sophisticated aggregation techniques, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world scenarios, issues such as occlusion, noise interference, and missing viewpoints can severely affect pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce the task of Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation. Traditional 3D pose estimation methods often rely on multi-stage networks and modular combinations, which can lead to cumulative errors and increased training complexity, making them unable to effectively address deficiency-aware estimation. To this end, we propose DeProPose, a flexible method that simplifies the network architecture to reduce training complexity and avoid information loss in multi-stage designs. Additionally, the model innovatively introduces a multi-view feature fusion mechanism based on relative projection error, which effectively utilizes information from multiple viewpoints and dynamically assigns weights, enabling efficient integration and enhanced robustness to overcome deficiency-aware 3D Pose Estimation challenges. Furthermore, to thoroughly evaluate this end-to-end multi-view 3D human pose estimation model and to advance research on occlusion-related challenges, we have developed a novel 3D human pose estimation dataset, termed the Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation (DA-3DPE) dataset. This dataset encompasses a wide range of deficiency scenarios, including noise interference, missing viewpoints, and occlusion challenges. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, DeProPose not only excels in addressing the deficiency-aware problem but also shows improvement in conventional scenarios, providing a powerful and user-friendly solution for 3D human pose estimation.

In this paper, we introduce the challenge of unsupervised categorical prior learning in pose estimation, where AI models learn a general pose prior for an object category from images in a self-supervised manner. Although priors are effective in estimating pose, acquiring them can be difficult. We propose a novel method, named Pose Prior Learner (PPL), to learn a general pose prior for any object category. PPL uses a hierarchical memory to store compositional parts of prototypical poses, from which we distill a general pose prior. This prior improves pose estimation accuracy through template transformation and image reconstruction. PPL learns meaningful pose priors without any additional human annotations or interventions, outperforming competitive baselines on both human and animal pose estimation datasets. Notably, our experimental results reveal the effectiveness of PPL using learned prototypical poses for pose estimation on occluded images. Through iterative inference, PPL leverages the pose prior to refine estimated poses, regressing them to any prototypical poses stored in memory. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Though existing methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often exhibit limitations due to constrained dataset diversity and the restricted amount of information derived from audio inputs. To address these challenges, we present VarGes, a novel variation-driven framework designed to enhance co-speech gesture generation by integrating visual stylistic cues while maintaining naturalness. Our approach begins with the Variation-Enhanced Feature Extraction (VEFE) module, which seamlessly incorporates \textcolor{blue}{style-reference} video data into a 3D human pose estimation network to extract StyleCLIPS, thereby enriching the input with stylistic information. Subsequently, we employ the Variation-Compensation Style Encoder (VCSE), a transformer-style encoder equipped with an additive attention mechanism pooling layer, to robustly encode diverse StyleCLIPS representations and effectively manage stylistic variations. Finally, the Variation-Driven Gesture Predictor (VDGP) module fuses MFCC audio features with StyleCLIPS encodings via cross-attention, injecting this fused data into a cross-conditional autoregressive model to modulate 3D human gesture generation based on audio input and stylistic clues. The efficacy of our approach is validated on benchmark datasets, where it outperforms existing methods in terms of gesture diversity and naturalness.

Feed-forward scene reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded 3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D tracking methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hubert0527.github.io/dgslrm/</p></details> |

Currently, there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud models as backbones.

We present DynaSplat, an approach that extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes by integrating dynamic-static separation and hierarchical motion modeling. First, we classify scene elements as static or dynamic through a novel fusion of deformation offset statistics and 2D motion flow consistency, refining our spatial representation to focus precisely where motion matters. We then introduce a hierarchical motion modeling strategy that captures both coarse global transformations and fine-grained local movements, enabling accurate handling of intricate, non-rigid motions. Finally, we integrate physically-based opacity estimation to ensure visually coherent reconstructions, even under challenging occlusions and perspective shifts. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets reveal that DynaSplat not only surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in accuracy and realism but also provides a more intuitive, compact, and efficient route to dynamic scene reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Such task formulation, however, underutilizes the inherent video output of the drone and is sensitive to occlusions and viewpoint disparity. To address these limitations, we formulate a new video-based drone geo-localization task and propose the Video2BEV paradigm. This paradigm transforms the video into a Bird's Eye View (BEV), simplifying the subsequent \textbf{inter-platform} matching process. In particular, we employ Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct a 3D scene and obtain the BEV projection. Different from the existing transform methods, \eg, polar transform, our BEVs preserve more fine-grained details without significant distortion. To facilitate the discriminative \textbf{intra-platform} representation learning, our Video2BEV paradigm also incorporates a diffusion-based module for generating hard negative samples. To validate our approach, we introduce UniV, a new video-based geo-localization dataset that extends the image-based University-1652 dataset. UniV features flight paths at $30^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ elevation angles with increased frame rates of up to 10 frames per second (FPS). Extensive experiments on the UniV dataset show that our Video2BEV paradigm achieves competitive recall rates and outperforms conventional video-based methods. Compared to other competitive methods, our proposed approach exhibits robustness at lower elevations with more occlusions.</p></details> |  |

However, in the absence of human annotation, existing approaches still struggle to build a unified representation for objects that contain multiple movable parts. We introduce DeGSS, a unified framework that encodes articulated objects as deformable 3D Gaussian fields, embedding geometry, appearance, and motion in one compact representation. Each interaction state is modeled as a smooth deformation of a shared field, and the resulting deformation trajectories guide a progressive coarse-to-fine part segmentation that identifies distinct rigid components, all in an unsupervised manner. The refined field provides a spatially continuous, fully decoupled description of every part, supporting part-level reconstruction and precise modeling of their kinematic relationships. To evaluate generalization and realism, we enlarge the synthetic PartNet-Mobility benchmark and release RS-Art, a real-to-sim dataset that pairs RGB captures with accurately reverse-engineered 3D models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and stability.</p></details> |  |

However, the noisy and sparse nature of the returned scan data proves to be a challenging obstacle for existing point cloud matching based solutions, especially those originally intended for more accurate sensors such as LiDAR. Inspired by visual odometry research around 3D Gaussian Splatting, in this paper we propose using freely positioned 3D Gaussians to create a summarized representation of a radar point cloud tolerant to sensor noise, and subsequently leverage its inherent probability distribution function for registration (similar to NDT). Moreover, we propose simultaneously optimizing multiple scan matching hypotheses in order to further increase the robustness of the system against local optima of the function. Finally, we fuse our Gaussian modeling and scan matching algorithms into an EKF radar-inertial odometry system designed after current best practices. Experiments using publicly available 4D radar datasets show that our Gaussian-based odometry is comparable to existing registration algorithms, outperforming them in several sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and results can be publicly accessed at: https://github.com/robotics-upo/gaussian-rio-cpp</p></details> |

Existing compaction approaches address this by pruning Gaussians based on heuristic importance scores, without global fidelity guarantee. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel optimal transport perspective that casts 3DGS compaction as global Gaussian mixture reduction. Specifically, we first minimize the composite transport divergence over a KD-tree partition to produce a compact geometric representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method (i) yields negligible loss in rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to vanilla 3DGS with only 10% Gaussians; and (ii) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS compaction techniques. Notably, our method is applicable to any stage of vanilla or accelerated 3DGS pipelines, providing an efficient and agnostic pathway to lightweight neural rendering.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[HAIF-GS: Hierarchical and Induced Flow-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09518v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos remains a fundamental challenge in 3D vision. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision, and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation, eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level transformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate that HAIF-GS significantly outperforms prior dynamic 3DGS methods in rendering quality, temporal coherence, and reconstruction efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian2Scene: 3D Scene Representation Learning via Self-supervised Learning with 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08777v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in 2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct 3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TinySplat: Feedforward Approach for Generating Compact 3D Scene Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09479v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents a new paradigm to reconstruct 3D scenes. Using neural networks trained on large-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations from sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high reconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D Gaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization are not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this limitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for generating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward 3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that systematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce View-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by projecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy by aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis transformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an off-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression for 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods. Compared to the state-of-the-art compression approach, we achieve comparable quality with only 6% of the storage size. Meanwhile, our compression framework requires only 25% of the encoding time and 1% of the decoding time.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLoD: Integrating Flexible Level of Detail into 3D Gaussian Splatting for Customizable Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12894v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent works are restricted to specific hardware setups, either on only low-cost or on only high-end configurations. Approaches aimed at reducing 3DGS memory usage enable rendering on low-cost GPU but compromise rendering quality, which fails to leverage the hardware capabilities in the case of higher-end GPU. Conversely, methods that enhance rendering quality require high-end GPU with large VRAM, making such methods impractical for lower-end devices with limited memory capacity. Consequently, 3DGS-based works generally assume a single hardware setup and lack the flexibility to adapt to varying hardware constraints. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flexible Level of Detail (FLoD) for 3DGS. FLoD constructs a multi-level 3DGS representation through level-specific 3D scale constraints, where each level independently reconstructs the entire scene with varying detail and GPU memory usage. A level-by-level training strategy is introduced to ensure structural consistency across levels. Furthermore, the multi-level structure of FLoD allows selective rendering of image regions at different detail levels, providing additional memory-efficient rendering options. To our knowledge, among prior works which incorporate the concept of Level of Detail (LoD) with 3DGS, FLoD is the first to follow the core principle of LoD by offering adjustable options for a broad range of GPU settings. Experiments demonstrate that FLoD provides various rendering options with trade-offs between quality and memory usage, enabling real-time rendering under diverse memory constraints. Furthermore, we show that FLoD generalizes to different 3DGS frameworks, indicating its potential for integration into future state-of-the-art developments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://3dgs-flod.github.io/flod/</p></details> |

Combining 3D scenes with semantic fields facilitates the perception and understanding of the surrounding environment. However, key challenges include embedding semantics into 3D representations, achieving generalizable real-time reconstruction, and ensuring practical applicability by using only images as input without camera parameters or ground truth depth. To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to predict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated and unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D scene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and predict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder. During training, we propose a loss-guided view sampler to sample views from easy to hard, eliminating the need for ground truth depth or masks required by previous methods and stabilizing the training process. The whole model can be trained end-to-end using a photometric loss and a distillation loss that leverages semantic features from a pre-trained 2D semantic model. At the inference stage, our UniForward can reconstruct 3D scenes and the corresponding semantic fields in real time from only sparse-view images. The reconstructed 3D scenes achieve high-quality rendering, and the reconstructed 3D semantic field enables the rendering of view-consistent semantic features from arbitrary views, which can be further decoded into dense segmentation masks in an open-vocabulary manner. Experiments on novel view synthesis and novel view segmentation demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances for unifying 3D scene and semantic field reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM methods are typically limited to small, bounded indoor settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GigaSLAM, the first RGB NeRF / 3DGS-based SLAM framework for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, as demonstrated on the KITTI, KITTI 360, 4 Seasons and A2D2 datasets. Our approach employs a hierarchical sparse voxel map representation, where Gaussians are decoded by neural networks at multiple levels of detail. This design enables efficient, scalable mapping and high-fidelity viewpoint rendering across expansive, unbounded scenes. For front-end tracking, GigaSLAM utilizes a metric depth model combined with epipolar geometry and PnP algorithms to accurately estimate poses, while incorporating a Bag-of-Words-based loop closure mechanism to maintain robust alignment over long trajectories. Consequently, GigaSLAM delivers high-precision tracking and visually faithful rendering on urban outdoor benchmarks, establishing a robust SLAM solution for large-scale, long-term scenarios, and significantly extending the applicability of Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems to unbounded outdoor environments.

However, existing methods struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3) maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily long video streams. Code and models are available at https://github.com/nickwzk/StreamSplat.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, grounding language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could harness strong data priors. Our codes, benchmark, and datasets will be made public to accelerate research in generalizable 3DGS scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, codes, data and benchmark will be released</p></details> |

Existing methods typically partition large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86 dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

To support these features, we propose a novel representation that optimizes 3D scenes without relying on intensity-based intermediaries. We reformulate 3D Gaussian splatting with complex-valued Gaussian primitives, expanding support for rendering with light waves. By leveraging RGBD multi-view images, our method directly optimizes complex-valued Gaussians as a 3D holographic scene representation. This eliminates the need for computationally expensive hologram re-optimization. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 30x-10,000x speed improvements while maintaining on-par image quality, representing a first step towards geometrically aligned, physically plausible holographic scene representations.</p></details> | 28 pages, 21 figures |

It delivers realistic and detailed results through a collection of explicit 3D Gaussian primitives, each carrying opacity and view-dependent color. However, efficient rendering of many transparent primitives remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches either rasterize the Gaussians with approximate per-view sorting or rely on high-end RTX GPUs. This paper proposes a stochastic ray-tracing method to render 3D clouds of transparent primitives. Instead of processing all ray-Gaussian intersections in sequential order, each ray traverses the acceleration structure only once, randomly accepting and shading a single intersection (or $N$ intersections, using a simple extension). This approach minimizes shading time and avoids primitive sorting along the ray, thereby minimizing register usage and maximizing parallelism even on low-end GPUs. The cost of rays through the Gaussian asset is comparable to that of standard mesh-intersection rays. The shading is unbiased and has low variance, as our stochastic acceptance achieves importance sampling based on accumulated weight. The alignment with Monte Carlo philosophy simplifies implementation and integration into a conventional path-tracing framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, performing per-Gaussian neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper, we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses. Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by $7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset. SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets.

Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution, producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time (0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D scene enhancement.</p></details> |  |
| **[R3D2: Realistic 3D Asset Insertion via Diffusion for Autonomous Driving Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07826v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential. Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast, neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2 significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see https://research.zenseact.com/publications/R3D2/.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS beyond pure scene representation by introducing an approach for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without requiring manual labeling, termed OpenSplat3D. Our method leverages feature-splatting techniques to associate semantic information with individual Gaussians, enabling fine-grained scene understanding. We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with a contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve accurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language embeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven instance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and segment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions. We show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++ validation set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, its performance significantly degrades in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and geometric inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for high-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage involves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second stage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement model. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion model, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view Injection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI supplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference view with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency using epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer training strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through joint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that ProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |

Real robot data suffers from occlusions, noisy camera poses, dynamic scene elements, which hinder the creation of geometrically accurate and photorealistic digital twins of unseen objects. We introduce a novel real-to-sim framework tackling all these challenges at once. Our key insight is a hybrid scene representation merging the photorealistic rendering of 3D Gaussian Splatting with explicit object meshes suitable for physics simulation within a single representation. We propose an end-to-end optimization pipeline that leverages differentiable rendering and differentiable physics within MuJoCo to jointly refine all scene components - from object geometry and appearance to robot poses and physical parameters - directly from raw and imprecise robot trajectories. This unified optimization allows us to simultaneously achieve high-fidelity object mesh reconstruction, generate photorealistic novel views, and perform annotation-free robot pose calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach both in simulation and on challenging real-world sequences using an ALOHA 2 bi-manual manipulator, enabling more practical and robust real-to-simulation pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version correcting inadvertent omission in author list</p></details> |

However, in a scene represented by 3D Gaussian primitives, interactions between objects suffer from inaccurate 3D segmentation, imprecise deformation among different materials, and severe rendering artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIG: Physically-Based Multi-Material Interaction with 3D Gaussians, a novel approach that combines 3D object segmentation with the simulation of interacting objects in high precision. Firstly, our method facilitates fast and accurate mapping from 2D pixels to 3D Gaussians, enabling precise 3D object-level segmentation. Secondly, we assign unique physical properties to correspondingly segmented objects within the scene for multi-material coupled interactions. Finally, we have successfully embedded constraint scales into deformation gradients, specifically clamping the scaling and rotation properties of the Gaussian primitives to eliminate artifacts and achieve geometric fidelity and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of visual quality, but also opens up new directions and pipelines for the field of physically realistic scene generation.</p></details> |  |

While aerial imagery offers broad coverage and complements limitations of ground-based data, reconstructing city-scale environments from such views remains challenging due to occlusions, incomplete geometry, and high memory demands. Recent advances like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) improve scalability and visual quality but remain limited by dense primitive usage, long training times, and poor suit ability for edge devices. We propose CityGo, a hybrid framework that combines textured proxy geometry with residual and surrounding 3D Gaussians for lightweight, photorealistic rendering of urban scenes from aerial perspectives. Our approach first extracts compact building proxy meshes from MVS point clouds, then uses zero order SH Gaussians to generate occlusion-free textures via image-based rendering and back-projection. To capture high-frequency details, we introduce residual Gaussians placed based on proxy-photo discrepancies and guided by depth priors. Broader urban context is represented by surrounding Gaussians, with importance-aware downsampling applied to non-critical regions to reduce redundancy. A tailored optimization strategy jointly refines proxy textures and Gaussian parameters, enabling real-time rendering of complex urban scenes on mobile GPUs with significantly reduced training and memory requirements. Extensive experiments on real-world aerial datasets demonstrate that our hybrid representation significantly reduces training time, achieving on average 1.4x speedup, while delivering comparable visual fidelity to pure 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches. Furthermore, CityGo enables real-time rendering of large-scale urban scenes on mobile consumer GPUs, with substantially reduced memory usage and energy consumption.</p></details> |  |

While recent methods leverage powerful novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques, such as three-dimensional Gaussian splatting (3DGS), they typically rely on randomly sampling multiple viewpoints or trajectories to ensure comprehensive coverage of discriminative visual cues. This approach, however, creates significant redundancy through overlapping image samples and lacks principled view selection, substantially increasing both rendering and comparison overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel IIN framework with a hierarchical scoring paradigm that estimates optimal viewpoints for target matching. Our approach integrates cross-level semantic scoring, utilizing CLIP-derived relevancy fields to identify regions with high semantic similarity to the target object class, with fine-grained local geometric scoring that performs precise pose estimation within promising regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |

Despite its impressive algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies. First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design, effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process, we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under review</p></details> |

However, regions with complex textures require numerous Gaussians to capture significant color variations accurately, leading to inefficiencies in rendering speed. To address this challenge, we introduce a hybrid representation for indoor scenes that combines 3DGS with textured meshes. Our approach uses textured meshes to handle texture-rich flat areas, while retaining Gaussians to model intricate geometries. The proposed method begins by pruning and refining the extracted mesh to eliminate geometrically complex regions. We then employ a joint optimization for 3DGS and mesh, incorporating a warm-up strategy and transmittance-aware supervision to balance their contributions seamlessly.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hybrid representation maintains comparable rendering quality and achieves superior frames per second FPS with fewer Gaussian primitives.</p></details> |  |

The Gaussian map constructed onboard the robot is optimized for both photometric and geometric quality while enabling real-time situational awareness for autonomy. We show through simulation experiments that our method yields comparable Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and similar reconstruction error to state-of-the-art approaches, while being orders of magnitude faster to compute. In real-world experiments, our algorithm achieves better map quality (at least 0.8dB higher PSNR and more than 16% higher geometric reconstruction accuracy) than maps constructed by a state-of-the-art method, enabling semantic segmentation using off-the-shelf open-set models.

| **[Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06909v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mapping systems with novel view synthesis (NVS) capabilities are widely used in computer vision, with augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving applications. Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes. While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes (GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more accurate than the state of the art.</p></details> |  |

Building on this sensitivity, Single Photon Cameras (SPCs) enable image capture at exceptionally high speeds under both low and high illumination. Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image (I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline (Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-StyleGS: Stylizing Gaussian Splatting with Multiple Styles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06846v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes. While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Hi-LSplat: Hierarchical 3D Language Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06822v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies. Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying. To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations. Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D scenes.</p></details> |  |

In particular, there is interest in enabling view synthesis for dynamic scenes using only monocular input data -- an ill-posed and challenging problem. The fast pace of work in this area has produced multiple simultaneous papers that claim to work best, which cannot all be true. In this work, we organize, benchmark, and analyze many Gaussian-splatting-based methods, providing apples-to-apples comparisons that prior works have lacked. We use multiple existing datasets and a new instructive synthetic dataset designed to isolate factors that affect reconstruction quality. We systematically categorize Gaussian splatting methods into specific motion representation types and quantify how their differences impact performance. Empirically, we find that their rank order is well-defined in synthetic data, but the complexity of real-world data currently overwhelms the differences. Furthermore, the fast rendering speed of all Gaussian-based methods comes at the cost of brittleness in optimization. We summarize our experiments into a list of findings that can help to further progress in this lively problem setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

These approaches, however, are limited by the pinhole camera model and lack effective modeling of defocus effects. Departing from this, we introduce DOF-GS--a new 3DGS-based framework with a finite-aperture camera model and explicit, differentiable defocus rendering, enabling it to function as a post-capture control tool. By training with multi-view images with moderate defocus blur, DOF-GS learns inherent camera characteristics and reconstructs sharp details of the underlying scene, particularly, enabling rendering of varying DOF effects through on-demand aperture and focal distance control, post-capture and optimization. Additionally, our framework extracts circle-of-confusion cues during optimization to identify in-focus regions in input views, enhancing the reconstructed 3D scene details. Experimental results demonstrate that DOF-GS supports post-capture refocusing, adjustable defocus and high-quality all-in-focus rendering, from multi-view images with uncalibrated defocus blur.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dof-gs.github.io/</p></details> |

While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges, including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pengc02.github.io/pghm/</p></details> |

At the forefront of research is how to model the structure when the imaged particles exhibit non-rigid conformational flexibility and compositional variation where parts are sometimes missing. We introduce a novel 3D reconstruction framework with a hierarchical Gaussian mixture model, inspired in part by Gaussian Splatting for 4D scene reconstruction. In particular, the structure of the model is grounded in an initial process that infers a part-based segmentation of the particle, providing essential inductive bias in order to handle both conformational and compositional variability.

Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location. Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction, registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances. Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Conference Papers 2025.

Existing NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry. Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.</p></details> |  |

However, endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints, we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity, facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction.

| **[Unifying Appearance Codes and Bilateral Grids for Driving Scene Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05280v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://bigcileng.github.io/bilateral-driving ; Code: https://github.com/BigCiLeng/bilateral-driving</p></details> |

However, training dense occupancy decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and once trained, such models struggle to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or novel object categories without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-Occ. Our method incrementally constructs, optimizes and voxelizes time-aware 3D Gaussians from raw sensor streams by integrating vision foundation models (VLMs) at runtime. The flexible nature of 3D Gaussians allows voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolutions, while the generalization ability of VLMs enables accurate perception and open-vocabulary recognition, without any network training or fine-tuning. Specifically, TT-Occ operates in a lift-track-voxelize symphony: We first lift the geometry and semantics of surrounding-view extracted from VLMs to instantiate Gaussians at 3D space; Next, we track dynamic Gaussians while accumulating static ones to complete the scene and enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we voxelize the optimized Gaussians to generate occupancy prediction. Optionally, inherent noise in VLM predictions and tracking is mitigated by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our framework, we offer two variants: one LiDAR-based and one vision-centric, and conduct extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft benchmarks with varying voxel resolutions. Code will be available at https://github.com/Xian-Bei/TT-Occ.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose Lumina, a hardware-algorithm co-designed system, which integrates two principal optimizations: a novel algorithm, S^2, and a radiance caching mechanism, RC, to improve the efficiency of neural rendering. S2 algorithm exploits temporal coherence in rendering to reduce the computational overhead, while RC leverages the color integration process of 3DGS to decrease the frequency of intensive rasterization computations. Coupled with these techniques, we propose an accelerator architecture, LuminCore, to further accelerate cache lookup and address the fundamental inefficiencies in Rasterization. We show that Lumina achieves 4.5x speedup and 5.3x energy reduction against a mobile Volta GPU, with a marginal quality loss (< 0.2 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio reduction) across synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we analyze these challenges and their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

Nonetheless, pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete. SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes. To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives, storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint. We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.</p></details> |  |

Existing neural rendering systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of complex 3D scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, depth discontinuities at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric smoothness, especially around object boundaries.

This challenge is particularly pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data. Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training data.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs. Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans. We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual sharpness.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of 91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Synthetic Stereo Datasets using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Expert Knowledge Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04908v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost, high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models. Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-X: Learning to Reconstruct Multi-Modal 3D Object Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04789v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings (e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image 3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization. Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches, establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoreal Scene Reconstruction from an Egocentric Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04444v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and recording profile are available at http://www.projectaria.com/photoreal-reconstruction/</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to SIGGRAPH Conference Paper 2025</p></details> |
| **[HuGeDiff: 3D Human Generation via Diffusion with Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04351v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail, accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality. We will make the code and dataset available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pseudo-Simulation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04218v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop approach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim.</p></details> |  |

However, 3DGS demands relatively significant GPU memory, limiting its use on devices with restricted computational resources. Previous approaches have focused on pruning less important Gaussians, effectively compressing 3DGS but often requiring a fine-tuning stage and lacking adaptability for the specific memory needs of different devices. In this work, we present an elastic inference method for 3DGS. Given an input for the desired model size, our method selects and transforms a subset of Gaussians, achieving substantial rendering performance without additional fine-tuning. We introduce a tiny learnable module that controls Gaussian selection based on the input percentage, along with a transformation module that adjusts the selected Gaussians to complement the performance of the reduced model. Comprehensive experiments on ZipNeRF, MipNeRF and Tanks\&Temples scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

This work introduces a new differentiable VG representation, dubbed B\'ezier Splatting, that enables fast yet high-fidelity VG rasterization. B\'ezier Splatting samples 2D Gaussians along B\'ezier curves, which naturally provide positional gradients at object boundaries. Thanks to the efficient splatting-based differentiable rasterizer, B\'ezier Splatting achieves 30x and 150x faster per forward and backward rasterization step for open curves compared to DiffVG. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive pruning and densification strategy that dynamically adjusts the spatial distribution of curves to escape local minima, further improving VG quality. Furthermore, our new VG representation supports conversion to standard XML-based SVG format, enhancing interoperability with existing VG tools and pipelines. Experimental results show that B\'ezier Splatting significantly outperforms existing methods with better visual fidelity and significant optimization speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xiliu8006.github.io/Bezier_splatting_project/</p></details> |
| **[JointSplat: Probabilistic Joint Flow-Depth Optimization for Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03872v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse viewpoints is a long-standing challenge with wide applications. Recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian sparse-view reconstruction methods provide an efficient solution for real-time novel view synthesis by leveraging geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view datasets and computing 3D Gaussian centers via back-projection. Despite offering strong geometric cues, both feed-forward multi-view depth estimation and flow-depth joint estimation face key limitations: the former suffers from mislocation and artifact issues in low-texture or repetitive regions, while the latter is prone to local noise and global inconsistency due to unreliable matches when ground-truth flow supervision is unavailable. To overcome this, we propose JointSplat, a unified framework that leverages the complementarity between optical flow and depth via a novel probabilistic optimization mechanism. Specifically, this pixel-level mechanism scales the information fusion between depth and flow based on the matching probability of optical flow during training. Building upon the above mechanism, we further propose a novel multi-view depth-consistency loss to leverage the reliability of supervision while suppressing misleading gradients in uncertain areas. Evaluated on RealEstate10K and ACID, JointSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed probabilistic joint flow-depth optimization approach for high-fidelity sparse-view 3D reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face scalability limitations (requiring 3D supervision or costly annotations), robustness issues (being susceptible to local optima), and rendering shortcomings (lacking speed or photorealism). We introduce SplArt, a self-supervised, category-agnostic framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to reconstruct articulated objects and infer kinematics from two sets of posed RGB images captured at different articulation states, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering for novel viewpoints and articulations. SplArt augments 3DGS with a differentiable mobility parameter per Gaussian, achieving refined part segmentation. A multi-stage optimization strategy is employed to progressively handle reconstruction, part segmentation, and articulation estimation, significantly enhancing robustness and accuracy. SplArt exploits geometric self-supervision, effectively addressing challenging scenarios without requiring 3D annotations or category-specific priors. Evaluations on established and newly proposed benchmarks, along with applications to real-world scenarios using a handheld RGB camera, demonstrate SplArt's state-of-the-art performance and real-world practicality.

| **[Robust Neural Rendering in the Wild with Asymmetric Dual 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03538v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D reconstruction from in-the-wild images remains a challenging task due to inconsistent lighting conditions and transient distractors. Existing methods typically rely on heuristic strategies to handle the low-quality training data, which often struggle to produce stable and consistent reconstructions, frequently resulting in visual artifacts. In this work, we propose Asymmetric Dual 3DGS, a novel framework that leverages the stochastic nature of these artifacts: they tend to vary across different training runs due to minor randomness. Specifically, our method trains two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models in parallel, enforcing a consistency constraint that encourages convergence on reliable scene geometry while suppressing inconsistent artifacts. To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes due to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that applies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a self-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the two models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency of model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy, which replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to preserve divergence. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches while achieving high efficiency. Codes and trained models will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on mobile devices, e.g., your smartphones, remains a significant challenge due to the limited resources on mobile devices. A natural solution is to offload computation to the cloud; however, naively streaming rendered frames from the cloud to the client introduces high latency and requires bandwidth far beyond the capacity of current wireless networks. In this paper, we propose an effective solution to enable city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians per second remains roughly constant. Leveraging this, we stream only the necessary Gaussians to the client. Specifically, on the cloud side, we propose asynchronous level-of-detail search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the client. On the client side, we accelerate rendering via a lookup table-based rasterization. Combined with holistic runtime optimizations, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager achieves over 100$\times$ reduction on data transfer and up to 8.9$\times$ speedup while retaining comparable rendering quality.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes. Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation. Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).</p></details> |  |

This challenge is particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets offer a promising alternative, existing approaches typically suffer from limited diversity in human appearance, motion, and scene composition due to their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines. To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and lifelike human sequences. Based on Gen4D, we present SportPAL, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning three sports: baseball, icehockey, and soccer. Together, Gen4D and SportPAL provide a scalable foundation for constructing synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks, with no need for manual 3D modeling or scene design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops</p></details> |

However, integrating semantic information into this representation remains a significant challenge, especially in maintaining real-time performance for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) applications. In this work, we introduce LEG-SLAM -- a novel approach that fuses an optimized Gaussian Splatting implementation with visual-language feature extraction using DINOv2 followed by a learnable feature compressor based on Principal Component Analysis, while enabling an online dense SLAM. Our method simultaneously generates high-quality photorealistic images and semantically labeled scene maps, achieving real-time scene reconstruction with more than 10 fps on the Replica dataset and 18 fps on ScanNet. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction speed while achieving competitive rendering quality. The proposed system eliminates the need for prior data preparation such as camera's ego motion or pre-computed static semantic maps. With its potential applications in autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and other interactive domains, LEG-SLAM represents a significant step forward in real-time semantic 3D Gaussian-based SLAM.

Currently, all existing methods rely on 2D or textual modalities during training or together at inference. This highlights the clear absence of a model capable of processing 3D data alone for learning semantics end-to-end, along with the necessary data to train such a model. Meanwhile, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the de facto standard for 3D scene representation across various vision tasks. However, effectively integrating semantic reasoning into 3DGS in a generalizable manner remains an open challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce SceneSplat, to our knowledge the first large-scale 3D indoor scene understanding approach that operates natively on 3DGS. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised learning scheme that unlocks rich 3D feature learning from unlabeled scenes. To power the proposed methods, we introduce SceneSplat-7K, the first large-scale 3DGS dataset for indoor scenes, comprising 7916 scenes derived from seven established datasets, such as ScanNet and Matterport3D. Generating SceneSplat-7K required computational resources equivalent to 150 GPU days on an L4 GPU, enabling standardized benchmarking for 3DGS-based reasoning for indoor scenes.

However, efficient real-time map reconstruction with data streamed from multiple robots and devices remains a challenge. To that end, we propose HAMMER, a server-based collaborative Gaussian Splatting method that leverages widely available ROS communication infrastructure to generate 3D, metric-semantic maps from asynchronous robot data-streams with no prior knowledge of initial robot positions and varying on-device pose estimators. HAMMER consists of (i) a frame alignment module that transforms local SLAM poses and image data into a global frame and requires no prior relative pose knowledge, and (ii) an online module for training semantic 3DGS maps from streaming data. HAMMER handles mixed perception modes, adjusts automatically for variations in image pre-processing among different devices, and distills CLIP semantic codes into the 3D scene for open-vocabulary language queries. In our real-world experiments, HAMMER creates higher-fidelity maps (2x) compared to competing baselines and is useful for downstream tasks, such as semantic goal-conditioned navigation (e.g., "go to the couch").

| **[Large Processor Chip Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02929v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer System Architecture serves as a crucial bridge between software applications and the underlying hardware, encompassing components like compilers, CPUs, coprocessors, and RTL designs. Its development, from early mainframes to modern domain-specific architectures, has been driven by rising computational demands and advancements in semiconductor technology. However, traditional paradigms in computer system architecture design are confronting significant challenges, including a reliance on manual expertise, fragmented optimization across software and hardware layers, and high costs associated with exploring expansive design spaces. While automated methods leveraging optimization algorithms and machine learning have improved efficiency, they remain constrained by a single-stage focus, limited data availability, and a lack of comprehensive human domain knowledge. The emergence of large language models offers transformative opportunities for the design of computer system architecture. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in areas such as code generation, data analysis, and performance modeling, the traditional manual design process can be transitioned to a machine-based automated design approach. To harness this potential, we present the Large Processor Chip Model (LPCM), an LLM-driven framework aimed at achieving end-to-end automated computer architecture design. The LPCM is structured into three levels: Human-Centric; Agent-Orchestrated; and Model-Governed. This paper utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting as a representative workload and employs the concept of software-hardware collaborative design to examine the implementation of the LPCM at Level 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth discussion on the pathway to implementing Level 2 and Level 3 of the LPCM, along with an analysis of the existing challenges.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method.

State-of-the-art methods employ 3D Gaussians to represent a scene, and render these Gaussians through splatting for higher efficiency and better rendering. However, these methods cannot scale up to extremely large scenes, due to the inefficient tracking and mapping strategies that need to optimize all 3D Gaussians in the limited GPU memories throughout the training to maintain the geometry and color consistency to previous RGBD observations. To resolve this issue, we propose novel tracking and mapping strategies to work with a novel 3D representation, dubbed view-tied 3D Gaussians, for RGBD SLAM systems. View-tied 3D Gaussians is a kind of simplified Gaussians, which is tied to depth pixels, without needing to learn locations, rotations, and multi-dimensional variances. Tying Gaussians to views not only significantly saves storage but also allows us to employ many more Gaussians to represent local details in the limited GPU memory. Moreover, our strategies remove the need of maintaining all Gaussians learnable throughout the training, while improving rendering quality, and tracking accuracy. We justify the effectiveness of these designs, and report better performance over the latest methods on the widely used benchmarks in terms of rendering and tracking accuracy and scalability.

However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vr-robo.github.io/</p></details> |

However, developing and evaluating 3DGS-enabled applications and optimizing their rendering performance, require realistic user navigation data. Such data is currently unavailable for photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes. This paper introduces EyeNavGS (EyeNavGS), the first publicly available 6-DoF navigation dataset featuring traces from 46 participants exploring twelve diverse, real-world 3DGS scenes. The dataset was collected at two sites, using the Meta Quest Pro headsets, recording the head pose and eye gaze data for each rendered frame during free world standing 6-DoF navigation. For each of the twelve scenes, we performed careful scene initialization to correct for scene tilt and scale, ensuring a perceptually-comfortable VR experience. We also release our open-source SIBR viewer software fork with record-and-replay functionalities and a suite of utility tools for data processing, conversion, and visualization. The EyeNavGS dataset and its accompanying software tools provide valuable resources for advancing research in 6-DoF viewport prediction, adaptive streaming, 3D saliency, and foveated rendering for 3DGS scenes.

| **[GASP: Gaussian Splatting for Physic-Based Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05819v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics simulation is paramount for modeling and utilization of 3D scenes in various real-world applications. However, its integration with state-of-the-art 3D scene rendering techniques such as Gaussian Splatting (GS) remains challenging. Existing models use additional meshing mechanisms, including triangle or tetrahedron meshing, marching cubes, or cage meshes. As an alternative, we can modify the physics grounded Newtonian dynamics to align with 3D Gaussian components. Current models take the first-order approximation of a deformation map, which locally approximates the dynamics by linear transformations. In contrast, our Gaussian Splatting for Physics-Based Simulations (GASP) model uses such a map (without any modifications) and flat Gaussian distributions, which are parameterized by three points (mesh faces). Subsequently, each 3D point (mesh face node) is treated as a discrete entity within a 3D space. Consequently, the problem of modeling Gaussian components is reduced to working with 3D points. Additionally, the information on mesh faces can be used to incorporate further properties into the physics model, facilitating the use of triangles. Resulting solution can be integrated into any physics engine that can be treated as a black box. As demonstrated in our studies, the proposed model exhibits superior performance on a diverse range of benchmark datasets designed for 3D object rendering.</p></details> |  |

Underwater scenes are challenging visual environments, as rendering through a medium such as water introduces both range and color dependent effects on image capture. We constrain 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a recent advance in radiance fields enabling rapid training and real-time rendering of full 3D scenes, with a physically grounded underwater image formation model. Applying SeaSplat to the real-world scenes from SeaThru-NeRF dataset, a scene collected by an underwater vehicle in the US Virgin Islands, and simulation-degraded real-world scenes, not only do we see increased quantitative performance on rendering novel viewpoints from the scene with the medium present, but are also able to recover the underlying true color of the scene and restore renders to be without the presence of the intervening medium. We show that the underwater image formation helps learn scene structure, with better depth maps, as well as show that our improvements maintain the significant computational improvements afforded by leveraging a 3D Gaussian representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025.

| **[A Survey of 3D Reconstruction with Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08438v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are rapidly emerging as powerful vision sensors for 3D reconstruction, uniquely capable of asynchronously capturing per-pixel brightness changes. Compared to traditional frame-based cameras, event cameras produce sparse yet temporally dense data streams, enabling robust and accurate 3D reconstruction even under challenging conditions such as high-speed motion, low illumination, and extreme dynamic range scenarios. These capabilities offer substantial promise for transformative applications across various fields, including autonomous driving, robotics, aerial navigation, and immersive virtual reality. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review exclusively dedicated to event-based 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches are systematically categorised based on input modality into stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems, and further classified according to reconstruction methodologies, including geometry-based techniques, deep learning approaches, and neural rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Within each category, methods are chronologically organised to highlight the evolution of key concepts and advancements. Furthermore, we provide a detailed summary of publicly available datasets specifically suited to event-based reconstruction tasks. Finally, we discuss significant open challenges in dataset availability, standardised evaluation, effective representation, and dynamic scene reconstruction, outlining insightful directions for future research. This survey aims to serve as an essential reference and provides a clear and motivating roadmap toward advancing the state of the art in event-driven 3D reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 16 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

However, their high storage requirements pose significant challenges for practical use in sharing, transmission, and storage. Despite various studies exploring GS compression from different perspectives, these efforts remain scattered across separate repositories, complicating benchmarking and the integration of best practices. To address this gap, we present GSCodec Studio, a unified and modular framework for GS reconstruction, compression, and rendering. The framework incorporates a diverse set of 3D/4D GS reconstruction methods and GS compression techniques as modular components, facilitating flexible combinations and comprehensive comparisons. By integrating best practices from community research and our own explorations, GSCodec Studio supports the development of compact representation and compression solutions for static and dynamic Gaussian Splats, namely our Static and Dynamic GSCodec, achieving competitive rate-distortion performance in static and dynamic GS compression.

Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects. Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views, while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted exploration. We believe this marks a significant step toward generating immersive and truly explorable virtual 3D environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: see https://the-world-explorer.github.io/, video: see https://youtu.be/c1lBnwJWNmE</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art approaches either struggle to generalize beyond demonstration datasets (e.g., imitation learning methods) or fail to generate physically grounded actions (e.g., VLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training open-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at inference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate WoMAP's superior performance in a broad range of zero-shot object localization tasks, with more than 9x and 2x higher success rates compared to VLM and diffusion policy baselines, respectively. Further, we show that WoMAP achieves strong generalization and sim-to-real transfer on a TidyBot.</p></details> |  |

This allows simulating safety-critical scenarios and augmenting training datasets without incurring further data collection costs. While recent advances in radiance fields have demonstrated promising results in 3D reconstruction and sensor data synthesis using cameras and LiDAR, their potential for radar remains largely unexplored. Radar is crucial for autonomous driving due to its robustness in adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow, where optical sensors often struggle. Although the state-of-the-art radar-based neural representation shows promise for 3D driving scene reconstruction, it performs poorly in scenarios with significant radar noise, including receiver saturation and multipath reflection. Moreover, it is limited to synthesizing preprocessed, noise-excluded radar images, failing to address realistic radar data synthesis. To address these limitations, this paper proposes RadarSplat, which integrates Gaussian Splatting with novel radar noise modeling to enable realistic radar data synthesis and enhanced 3D reconstruction. Compared to the state-of-the-art, RadarSplat achieves superior radar image synthesis (+3.4 PSNR / 2.6x SSIM) and improved geometric reconstruction (-40% RMSE / 1.5x Accuracy), demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity radar data and scene reconstruction.

It mitigates 3D inconsistency and training instability caused by distractor data in the cross-scenes generalizable train setting while enabling feedforward inference for 3DGS and distractor masks from references in the unseen scenes. To achieve these objectives, DGGS proposes a scene-agnostic reference-based mask prediction and refinement module during the training phase, effectively eliminating the impact of distractor on training stability. Moreover, we combat distractor-induced artifacts and holes at inference time through a novel two-stage inference framework for references scoring and re-selection, complemented by a distractor pruning mechanism that further removes residual distractor 3DGS-primitive influences. Extensive feedforward experiments on the real and our synthetic data show DGGS's reconstruction capability when dealing with novel distractor scenes. Moreover, our generalizable mask prediction even achieves an accuracy superior to existing scene-specific training methods. Homepage is https://github.com/bbbbby-99/DGGS.</p></details> |  |
| **[CountingFruit: Real-Time 3D Fruit Counting with Language-Guided Semantic Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01109v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate fruit counting in real-world agricultural environments is a longstanding challenge due to visual occlusions, semantic ambiguity, and the high computational demands of 3D reconstruction. Existing methods based on neural radiance fields suffer from low inference speed, limited generalization, and lack support for open-set semantic control. This paper presents FruitLangGS, a real-time 3D fruit counting framework that addresses these limitations through spatial reconstruction, semantic embedding, and language-guided instance estimation. FruitLangGS first reconstructs orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive Gaussian splatting pipeline with radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization for efficient rendering. To enable semantic control, each Gaussian encodes a compressed CLIP-aligned language embedding, forming a compact and queryable 3D representation. At inference time, prompt-based semantic filtering is applied directly in 3D space, without relying on image-space segmentation or view-level fusion. The selected Gaussians are then converted into dense point clouds via distribution-aware sampling and clustered to estimate fruit counts. Experimental results on real orchard data demonstrate that FruitLangGS achieves higher rendering speed, semantic flexibility, and counting accuracy compared to prior approaches, offering a new perspective for language-driven, real-time neural rendering across open-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of depth rendering consistency and efficient loop closure limits the quality of its geometric reconstructions and its ability to perform globally consistent mapping online. In this paper, we present 2DGS-SLAM, an RGB-D SLAM system using 2D Gaussian splatting as the map representation. By leveraging the depth-consistent rendering property of the 2D variant, we propose an accurate camera pose optimization method and achieve geometrically accurate 3D reconstruction. In addition, we implement efficient loop detection and camera relocalization by leveraging MASt3R, a 3D foundation model, and achieve efficient map updates by maintaining a local active map. Experiments show that our 2DGS-SLAM approach achieves superior tracking accuracy, higher surface reconstruction quality, and more consistent global map reconstruction compared to existing rendering-based SLAM methods, while maintaining high-fidelity image rendering and improved computational efficiency.</p></details> | 18 pages |

For generalisability, we start from a "foundation" model for monocular depth estimation and extend it to a full 3D shape and appearance reconstructor. For efficiency, we base this extension on feed-forward Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we predict a first layer of 3D Gaussians at the predicted depth, and then add additional layers of Gaussians that are offset in space, allowing the model to complete the reconstruction behind occlusions and truncations. Flash3D is very efficient, trainable on a single GPU in a day, and thus accessible to most researchers. It achieves state-of-the-art results when trained and tested on RealEstate10k. When transferred to unseen datasets like NYU it outperforms competitors by a large margin. More impressively, when transferred to KITTI, Flash3D achieves better PSNR than methods trained specifically on that dataset. In some instances, it even outperforms recent methods that use multiple views as input.

The problem was successfully tackled by fully volumetric NeRF-based methods which can model both the geometry and the medium (water). Unfortunately, these methods are slow to train and do not offer real-time rendering. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method offered a fast alternative to NeRFs. However, because it is an explicit method that renders only the geometry, it cannot render the medium and is therefore unsuited for underwater reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that fuses volumetric rendering with 3DGS to handle underwater data effectively. Our method employs 3DGS for explicit geometry representation and a separate volumetric field (queried once per pixel) for capturing the scattering medium. This dual representation further allows the restoration of the scenes by removing the scattering medium. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods in rendering quality on the underwater SeaThru-NeRF dataset. Furthermore, it does so while offering real-time rendering performance, addressing the efficiency limitations of existing methods.

In this work, we propose a novel extension to 4D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes. Drawing on ideas from residual learning, we hierarchically decompose the dynamic scene into a "video-segment-frame" structure, with segments dynamically adjusted by optical flow. Then, instead of directly predicting the time-dependent signals, we model the signal as the sum of video-constant values, segment-constant values, and frame-specific residuals, as inspired by the success of residual learning. This approach allows more flexible models that adapt to highly variable scenes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets, with the greatest improvements on complex scenes with large movements, occlusions, and fine details, where current methods degrade most.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 4D Vision Workshop @ CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Their ability to produce both physically plausible and differentiable models of scenes are key ingredient needed to produce physically plausible adversarial attacks on DNNs. However, the adversarial machine learning community has yet to fully explore these capabilities, partly due to differing attack goals (e.g., misclassification, misdetection) and a wide range of possible scene manipulations used to achieve them (e.g., alter texture, mesh). This survey contributes the first framework that unifies diverse goals and tasks, facilitating easy comparison of existing work, identifying research gaps, and highlighting future directions - ranging from expanding attack goals and tasks to account for new modalities, state-of-the-art models, tools, and pipelines, to underscoring the importance of studying real-world threats in complex scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables, IJCAI '25 Survey Track</p></details> |

We introduce AdaHuman, a novel framework that generates high-fidelity animatable 3D avatars from a single in-the-wild image. AdaHuman incorporates two key innovations: (1) A pose-conditioned 3D joint diffusion model that synthesizes consistent multi-view images in arbitrary poses alongside corresponding 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) reconstruction at each diffusion step; (2) A compositional 3DGS refinement module that enhances the details of local body parts through image-to-image refinement and seamlessly integrates them using a novel crop-aware camera ray map, producing a cohesive detailed 3D avatar. These components allow AdaHuman to generate highly realistic standardized A-pose avatars with minimal self-occlusion, enabling rigging and animation with any input motion. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and in-the-wild images demonstrates that AdaHuman significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both avatar reconstruction and reposing.

This paper proposes TC-GS, an algorithm-independent universal module that expands Tensor Core (TCU) applicability for 3DGS, leading to substantial speedups and seamless integration into existing 3DGS optimization frameworks. The key innovation lies in mapping alpha computation to matrix multiplication, fully utilizing otherwise idle TCUs in existing 3DGS implementations. TC-GS provides plug-and-play acceleration for existing top-tier acceleration algorithms tightly coupled with rendering pipeline designs, like Gaussian compression and redundancy elimination algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local coordinate transformation to mitigate rounding errors from quadratic terms of pixel coordinates caused by Tensor Core half-precision computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains rendering quality while providing an additional 2.18x speedup over existing Gaussian acceleration algorithms, thus reaching up to a total 5.6x acceleration.

Many studies extend this paradigm for language-driven open-vocabulary scene understanding. However, most of them simply project 2D semantic features onto 3D Gaussians and overlook a fundamental gap between 2D and 3D understanding: a 3D object may exhibit various semantics from different viewpoints--a phenomenon we term view-dependent semantics. To address this challenge, we propose LaGa (Language Gaussians), which establishes cross-view semantic connections by decomposing the 3D scene into objects. Then, it constructs view-aggregated semantic representations by clustering semantic descriptors and reweighting them based on multi-view semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaGa effectively captures key information from view-dependent semantics, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes. Notably, under the same settings, LaGa achieves a significant improvement of +18.7% mIoU over the previous SOTA on the LERF-OVS dataset.

Our approach is inspired from Gaussian splatting techniques, typically used in 3D rendering, which we adapt for high-dimensional search and classification. We optimize Gaussian parameters using information-theoretic objectives that balance coverage, assignment confidence, and structural and semantic consistency. A key contribution is to progressively refine the representation through split and clone operations, handling hundreds of dimensions, thus handling varying data densities. GARLIC offers the fast building times of traditional space partitioning methods (e.g., under \(\sim5\) min build time for SIFT1M) while achieving \(\sim50\%\) Recall10@10 in low-candidate regimes. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate our method's consistency in (a) \(k\)-NN retrieval, outperforming methods, such as Faiss-IVF, in fast-recall by using about half their probes for the same Recall10@10 in Fashion-MNIST, and (b) in classification tasks, beating by \(\sim15\%\) accuracy other majority voting methods. Further, we show strong generalization capabilities, maintaining high accuracy even with downsampled training data: using just \(1\%\) of the training data returns \(\sim 45\%\) Recall@1, thus making GARLIC quite powerful for applications requiring both speed and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, their scalability is fundamentally constrained by the limited capacity of their encoders, leading to degraded performance or excessive memory consumption as the number of input views increases. In this work, we analyze feed-forward 3DGS frameworks through the lens of the Information Bottleneck principle and introduce ZPressor, a lightweight architecture-agnostic module that enables efficient compression of multi-view inputs into a compact latent state $Z$ that retains essential scene information while discarding redundancy. Concretely, ZPressor enables existing feed-forward 3DGS models to scale to over 100 input views at 480P resolution on an 80GB GPU, by partitioning the views into anchor and support sets and using cross attention to compress the information from the support views into anchor views, forming the compressed latent state $Z$. We show that integrating ZPressor into several state-of-the-art feed-forward 3DGS models consistently improves performance under moderate input views and enhances robustness under dense view settings on two large-scale benchmarks DL3DV-10K and RealEstate10K.

While diffusion-based methods effectively model continuous latent spaces and AR models excel at capturing inter-token dependencies, combining these paradigms for 3D shape generation remains a challenge. To address this, LTM3D features a Conditional Distribution Modeling backbone, leveraging a masked autoencoder and a diffusion model to enhance token dependency learning. Additionally, we introduce Prefix Learning, which aligns condition tokens with shape latent tokens during generation, improving flexibility across modalities. We further propose a Latent Token Reconstruction module with Reconstruction-Guided Sampling to reduce uncertainty and enhance structural fidelity in generated shapes. Our approach operates in token space, enabling support for multiple 3D representations, including signed distance fields, point clouds, meshes, and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Extensive experiments on image- and text-conditioned shape generation tasks demonstrate that LTM3D outperforms existing methods in prompt fidelity and structural accuracy while offering a generalizable framework for multi-modal, multi-representation 3D generation.</p></details> |  |

However, its high efficiency stems from an approximation of projecting 3D Gaussians onto the image plane as 2D Gaussians, which inherently limits rendering quality--particularly under large Field-of-View (FoV) camera inputs. While several recent works have extended 3DGS to mitigate these approximation errors, none have successfully achieved both exactness and high efficiency simultaneously. In this work, we introduce 3DGEER, an Exact and Efficient Volumetric Gaussian Rendering method. Starting from first principles, we derive a closed-form expression for the density integral along a ray traversing a 3D Gaussian distribution. This formulation enables precise forward rendering with arbitrary camera models and supports gradient-based optimization of 3D Gaussian parameters. To ensure both exactness and real-time performance, we propose an efficient method for computing a tight Particle Bounding Frustum (PBF) for each 3D Gaussian, enabling accurate and efficient ray-Gaussian association. We also introduce a novel Bipolar Equiangular Projection (BEAP) representation to accelerate ray association under generic camera models. BEAP further provides a more uniform ray sampling strategy to apply supervision, which empirically improves reconstruction quality. Experiments on multiple pinhole and fisheye datasets show that our method consistently outperforms prior methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in real-time neural rendering.</p></details> |  |

However, existing diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations, which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text recognition accuracy.

| **[ReSim: Reliable World Simulation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09981v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we reliably simulate future driving scenarios under a wide range of ego driving behaviors? Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator (e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones. To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://opendrivelab.com/ReSim</p></details> |
| **[Canonical Latent Representations in Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09955v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM features preserve essential categorical information while discarding non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that can drive robust representation learning.</p></details> | 45 pages,41 figures |
| **[HadaNorm: Diffusion Transformer Quantization through Mean-Centered Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09932v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 4 Pages, 5 Figures |

RNE connects and unifies a variety of existing density estimation and inference-time control methods under a single and intuitive perspective, stemming from basic variational inference and probabilistic principles therefore offering both theoretical clarity and practical versatility. Experiments demonstrate that RNE delivers strong results in diffusion density estimation, and offers broad applicability to inference-time control tasks -- such as annealing, diffusion model composition, and reward-tilting -- with promising inference-time scaling performance.</p></details> | 39 pages; 14 figures |

We introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First, from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[TransGI: Real-Time Dynamic Global Illumination With Object-Centric Neural Transfer Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09909v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural rendering algorithms have revolutionized computer graphics, yet their impact on real-time rendering under arbitrary lighting conditions remains limited due to strict latency constraints in practical applications. The key challenge lies in formulating a compact yet expressive material representation. To address this, we propose TransGI, a novel neural rendering method for real-time, high-fidelity global illumination. It comprises an object-centric neural transfer model for material representation and a radiance-sharing lighting system for efficient illumination. Traditional BSDF representations and spatial neural material representations lack expressiveness, requiring thousands of ray evaluations to converge to noise-free colors. Conversely, real-time methods trade quality for efficiency by supporting only diffuse materials. In contrast, our object-centric neural transfer model achieves compactness and expressiveness through an MLP-based decoder and vertex-attached latent features, supporting glossy effects with low memory overhead. For dynamic, varying lighting conditions, we introduce local light probes capturing scene radiance, coupled with an across-probe radiance-sharing strategy for efficient probe generation. We implemented our method in a real-time rendering engine, combining compute shaders and CUDA-based neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves real-time performance of less than 10 ms to render a frame and significantly improved rendering quality compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

This complex interplay leads to a wide variety of karst network patterns, each intricately linked to specific hydrogeological conditions. We explore a novel approach that represents karst networks as graphs and applies graph generative models (deep learning techniques) to capture the intricate nature of karst environments. In this representation, nodes retain spatial information and properties, while edges signify connections between nodes. Our generative process consists of two main steps. First, we utilize graph recurrent neural networks (GraphRNN) to learn the topological distribution of karst networks. GraphRNN decomposes the graph simulation into a sequential generation of nodes and edges, informed by previously generated structures. Second, we employ denoising diffusion probabilistic models on graphs (G-DDPM) to learn node features (spatial coordinates and other properties). G-DDPMs enable the generation of nodes features on the graphs produced by the GraphRNN that adhere to the learned statistical properties by sampling from the derived probability distribution, ensuring that the generated graphs are realistic and capture the essential features of the original data. We test our approach using real-world karst networks and compare generated subgraphs with actual subgraphs from the database, by using geometry and topology metrics. Our methodology allows stochastic simulation of discrete karst networks across various types of formations, a useful tool for studying the behavior of physical processes such as flow and transport.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 15 figures, submitted to Earth and Space Science</p></details> |

While numerous works have been proposed to synthesize anomalous samples, these synthetic anomalies often lack authenticity or require extensive training data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Anomaly Anything (AnomalyAny), a novel framework that leverages Stable Diffusion (SD)'s image generation capabilities to generate diverse and realistic unseen anomalies. By conditioning on a single normal sample during test time, AnomalyAny is able to generate unseen anomalies for arbitrary object types with text descriptions. Within AnomalyAny, we propose attention-guided anomaly optimization to direct SD attention on generating hard anomaly concepts. Additionally, we introduce prompt-guided anomaly refinement, incorporating detailed descriptions to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate AnomalyAny's ability in generating high-quality unseen anomalies and its effectiveness in enhancing downstream AD performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages excluding supplementary</p></details> |

Such task formulation, however, underutilizes the inherent video output of the drone and is sensitive to occlusions and viewpoint disparity. To address these limitations, we formulate a new video-based drone geo-localization task and propose the Video2BEV paradigm. This paradigm transforms the video into a Bird's Eye View (BEV), simplifying the subsequent \textbf{inter-platform} matching process. In particular, we employ Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct a 3D scene and obtain the BEV projection. Different from the existing transform methods, \eg, polar transform, our BEVs preserve more fine-grained details without significant distortion. To facilitate the discriminative \textbf{intra-platform} representation learning, our Video2BEV paradigm also incorporates a diffusion-based module for generating hard negative samples. To validate our approach, we introduce UniV, a new video-based geo-localization dataset that extends the image-based University-1652 dataset. UniV features flight paths at $30^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ elevation angles with increased frame rates of up to 10 frames per second (FPS). Extensive experiments on the UniV dataset show that our Video2BEV paradigm achieves competitive recall rates and outperforms conventional video-based methods. Compared to other competitive methods, our proposed approach exhibits robustness at lower elevations with more occlusions.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have shown that these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation, text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models. We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness of our proposed calibration approach.</p></details> |  |

Critical challenges to address include data privacy and over-fitting on small and noisy datasets during both training and inference. Additionally, such forecasting models must scale well with the number of parties while ensuring strong convergence and low-tuning complexity. We address these challenges and propose ``Secret-shared Time Series Forecasting with VFL'' (STV), a novel framework with the following key features: i) a privacy-preserving algorithm for forecasting with SARIMAX and autoregressive trees on vertically-partitioned data; ii) decentralised forecasting using secret sharing and multi-party computation; and iii) novel N-party algorithms for matrix multiplication and inverse operations for exact parameter optimization, giving strong convergence with minimal tuning complexity. We evaluate on six representative datasets from public and industry-specific contexts. Results demonstrate that STV's forecasting accuracy is comparable to those of centralized approaches. Our exact optimization outperforms centralized methods, including state-of-the-art diffusion models and long-short-term memory, by 23.81% on forecasting accuracy. We also evaluate scalability by examining the communication costs of exact and iterative optimization to navigate the choice between the two.

Among the leading approaches, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) construct such examples by mapping a Brownian motion via a diffusion process driven by an estimated score function. In this work, we first provide empirical evidence that DDPMs are robust to constant-variance noise in the score evaluations. We then establish finite-sample guarantees in Wasserstein-2 distance that exhibit two key features: (i) they characterize and quantify the robustness of DDPMs to noisy score estimates, and (ii) they achieve faster convergence rates than previously known results. Furthermore, we observe that the obtained rates match those known in the Gaussian case, implying their optimality.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods require MIDI annotations for supervised training, limiting the diversity of instrument timbres and expression styles in the output. We propose CoSaRef, a MIDI-to-audio synthesis method that does not require MIDI-audio paired datasets. CoSaRef first generates a synthetic audio track using concatenative synthesis based on MIDI input, then refines it with a diffusion-based deep generative model trained on datasets without MIDI annotations. This approach improves the diversity of timbres and expression styles. Additionally, it allows detailed control over timbres and expression through audio sample selection and extra MIDI design, similar to traditional functions in digital audio workstations. Experiments showed that CoSaRef could generate realistic tracks while preserving fine-grained timbre control via one-shot samples. Moreover, despite not being supervised on MIDI annotation, CoSaRef outperformed the state-of-the-art timbre-controllable method based on MIDI supervision in both objective and subjective evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress; 7 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, in this paper, we demonstrate that the standard implementation of this technique does not necessarily lead to a distribution closer to the real data distribution. Specifically, we show that training the discriminator using Cross-Entropy loss, as commonly done, can in fact increase the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and target distributions, particularly when the discriminator overfits. To address this, we propose a theoretically sound training objective for discriminator guidance that properly minimizes the KL divergence. We analyze its properties and demonstrate empirically across multiple datasets that our proposed method consistently improves over the conventional method by producing samples of higher quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases - ECML PKDD 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods primarily address single-person activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137 fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133 using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF, leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation generation.

Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |

Mechanistic PDE Networks represent spatiotemporal data as space-time dependent linear partial differential equations in neural network hidden representations. The represented PDEs are then solved and decoded for specific tasks. The learned PDE representations naturally express the spatiotemporal dynamics in data in neural network hidden space, enabling increased power for dynamical modeling. Solving the PDE representations in a compute and memory-efficient way, however, is a significant challenge. We develop a native, GPU-capable, parallel, sparse, and differentiable multigrid solver specialized for linear partial differential equations that acts as a module in Mechanistic PDE Networks. Leveraging the PDE solver, we propose a discovery architecture that can discover nonlinear PDEs in complex settings while also being robust to noise. We validate PDE discovery on a number of PDEs, including reaction-diffusion and Navier-Stokes equations.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing a 6{,}000-hour East African news corpus spanning five languages, we show that \emph{within-phylum} language pairs exhibit 30--40\% lower pause variance and over 3$\times$ higher onset/offset correlation compared to cross-phylum pairs. These findings motivate \textbf{SPaDA}, a dynamic-programming alignment algorithm that integrates silence consistency, rate synchrony, and semantic similarity. SPaDA improves alignment $F_1$ by +3--4 points and eliminates up to 38\% of spurious matches relative to greedy VAD baselines. Using SPaDA-aligned segments, we train \textbf{SegUniDiff}, a diffusion-based S2ST model guided by \emph{external gradients} from frozen semantic and speaker encoders. SegUniDiff matches an enhanced cascade in BLEU (30.3 on CVSS-C vs.\ 28.9 for UnitY), reduces speaker error rate (EER) from 12.5\% to 5.3\%, and runs at an RTF of 1.02. To support evaluation in low-resource settings, we also release a three-tier, transcript-free BLEU suite (M1--M3) that correlates strongly with human judgments. Together, our results show that prosodic cues in multilingual speech provide a reliable scaffold for scalable, non-autoregressive S2ST.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods neglect the T2I patches' attack effectiveness when observed from different views in the physical world (i.e., angle robustness of the T2I adversarial patches). In this paper, we study the angle robustness of T2I adversarial patches comprehensively, revealing their angle-robust issues, demonstrating that texts affect the angle robustness of generated patches significantly, and task-specific linguistic instructions fail to enhance the angle robustness. Motivated by the studies, we introduce Angle-Robust Concept Learning (AngleRoCL), a simple and flexible approach that learns a generalizable concept (i.e., text embeddings in implementation) representing the capability of generating angle-robust patches. The learned concept can be incorporated into textual prompts and guides T2I models to generate patches with their attack effectiveness inherently resistant to viewpoint variations. Through extensive simulation and physical-world experiments on five SOTA detectors across multiple views, we demonstrate that AngleRoCL significantly enhances the angle robustness of T2I adversarial patches compared to baseline methods. Our patches maintain high attack success rates even under challenging viewing conditions, with over 50% average relative improvement in attack effectiveness across multiple angles. This research advances the understanding of physically angle-robust patches and provides insights into the relationship between textual concepts and physical properties in T2I-generated contents.</p></details> |  |

Traditional optical flow methods require consecutive frames, which are often unavailable due to limitations in data acquisition or real-world scene disruptions. Thus, single-frame optical flow estimation is emerging in the literature. However, existing single-frame approaches suffer from two major limitations: (1) they rely on labeled training data, making them task-specific, and (2) they produce deterministic predictions, failing to capture motion uncertainty. To overcome these challenges, we propose ProbDiffFlow, a training-free framework that estimates optical flow distributions from a single image. Instead of directly predicting motion, ProbDiffFlow follows an estimation-by-synthesis paradigm: it first generates diverse plausible future frames using a diffusion-based model, then estimates motion from these synthesized samples using a pre-trained optical flow model, and finally aggregates the results into a probabilistic flow distribution. This design eliminates the need for task-specific training while capturing multiple plausible motions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ProbDiffFlow achieves superior accuracy, diversity, and efficiency, outperforming existing single-image and two-frame baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS)</p></details> |

In this approach, convection and diffusion can be independently treated either explicitly or implicitly, which in particular allows to construct implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods. Original SRK schemes (Colomes, Badia, IJNME, 2015) are designed for finite-element methods that satisfy the inf-sup condition. In this paper, the idea of SRK schemes is generalized to spatial discretizations with pressure stabilization. In the numerical experiments, SRK schemes are demonstrated with both finite-difference and finite element spatial discretizations. Numerical results show that one of the SRK schemes outperforms the third-order multistep projection-based method in terms of accuracy while preserving the computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Recent 2D methods break this limitation via pre-trained diffusion models, but they struggle for pose generality and scene interaction. To this end, we propose MIMO, a novel framework which can not only synthesize character videos with controllable attributes (i.e., character, motion and scene) provided by simple user inputs, but also simultaneously achieve advanced scalability to arbitrary characters, generality to novel 3D motions, and applicability to interactive real-world scenes in a unified framework. The core idea is to encode the 2D video to compact spatial codes, considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence. Concretely, we lift the 2D frame pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators, and decompose the video clip to three spatial components (i.e., main human, underlying scene, and floating occlusion) in hierarchical layers based on the 3D depth. These components are further encoded to canonical identity code, structured motion code and full scene code, which are utilized as control signals of synthesis process. The design of spatial decomposed modeling enables flexible user control, complex motion expression, as well as 3D-aware synthesis for scene interactions. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://menyifang.github.io/projects/MIMO/index.html</p></details> |
| **[Fast Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion: 100x Speedup via Parallel Sparse Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09498v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Negative Guidance of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14398v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negative Prompting (NP) is widely utilized in diffusion models, particularly in text-to-image applications, to prevent the generation of undesired features. In this paper, we show that conventional NP is limited by the assumption of a constant guidance scale, which may lead to highly suboptimal results, or even complete failure, due to the non-stationarity and state-dependence of the reverse process. Based on this analysis, we derive a principled technique called Dynamic Negative Guidance, which relies on a near-optimal time and state dependent modulation of the guidance without requiring additional training. Unlike NP, negative guidance requires estimating the posterior class probability during the denoising process, which is achieved with limited additional computational overhead by tracking the discrete Markov Chain during the generative process. We evaluate the performance of DNG class-removal on MNIST and CIFAR10, where we show that DNG leads to higher safety, preservation of class balance and image quality when compared with baseline methods. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to use DNG with Stable Diffusion to obtain more accurate and less invasive guidance than NP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICLR 2025 (poster).

| **[DeepMultiConnectome: Deep Multi-Task Prediction of Structural Connectomes Directly from Diffusion MRI Tractography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22685v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies. We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation. The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function. Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

Even if they produce impressive image restoration results, these algorithms rely on a non-standard use of a denoiser on images that are less and less noisy along the iterations, which contrasts with recent algorithms based on Diffusion Models (DM), where the denoiser is applied only on re-noised images. We propose a new PnP framework, called Stochastic deNOising REgularization (SNORE), which applies the denoiser only on images with noise of the adequate level. It is based on an explicit stochastic regularization, which leads to a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve ill-posed inverse problems. A convergence analysis of this algorithm and its annealing extension is provided. Experimentally, we prove that SNORE is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art methods on deblurring and inpainting tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marrying Autoregressive Transformer and Diffusion with Multi-Reference Autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09482v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unified and Lossless Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality. On GEOM-Drugs, it reduces FCD by 72.6\% over the previous best result, while achieving over 70\% relative average improvements in geometric fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Adversarial Purification from the Perspective of the Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01267v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion-based adversarial purification methods attempt to drown adversarial perturbations into a part of isotropic noise through the forward process, and then recover the clean images through the reverse process. Due to the lack of distribution information about adversarial perturbations in the pixel domain, it is often unavoidable to damage normal semantics. We turn to the frequency domain perspective, decomposing the image into amplitude spectrum and phase spectrum. We find that for both spectra, the damage caused by adversarial perturbations tends to increase monotonically with frequency. This means that we can extract the content and structural information of the original clean sample from the frequency components that are less damaged. Meanwhile, theoretical analysis indicates that existing purification methods indiscriminately damage all frequency components, leading to excessive damage to the image. Therefore, we propose a purification method that can eliminate adversarial perturbations while maximizing the preservation of the content and structure of the original image. Specifically, at each time step during the reverse process, for the amplitude spectrum, we replace the low-frequency components of the estimated image's amplitude spectrum with the corresponding parts of the adversarial image. For the phase spectrum, we project the phase of the estimated image into a designated range of the adversarial image's phase spectrum, focusing on the low frequencies. Empirical evidence from extensive experiments demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms most current defense methods.</p></details> |  |

Derived from rigorous RL theory, ReinFlow injects learnable noise into a flow policy's deterministic path, converting the flow into a discrete-time Markov Process for exact and straightforward likelihood computation. This conversion facilitates exploration and ensures training stability, enabling ReinFlow to fine-tune diverse flow model variants, including Rectified Flow [35] and Shortcut Models [19], particularly at very few or even one denoising step. We benchmark ReinFlow in representative locomotion and manipulation tasks, including long-horizon planning with visual input and sparse reward. The episode reward of Rectified Flow policies obtained an average net growth of 135.36% after fine-tuning in challenging legged locomotion tasks while saving denoising steps and 82.63% of wall time compared to state-of-the-art diffusion RL fine-tuning method DPPO [43]. The success rate of the Shortcut Model policies in state and visual manipulation tasks achieved an average net increase of 40.34% after fine-tuning with ReinFlow at four or even one denoising step, whose performance is comparable to fine-tuned DDIM policies while saving computation time for an average of 23.20%.

The tool is designed as a general-purpose wave model for offshore engineering applications. Built within the open-source framework Firedrake, the new FNPF-SEM model is designed as a computational tool capable of capturing both linear and nonlinear wave phenomena with high accuracy and efficiency, with support for high-order (spectral) finite elements. Additionally, Firedrake provides native support for MPI-based parallelism, allowing for efficient multi-CPU distributed computations needed for large-scale simulations. We demonstrate the capabilities of the high-order spectral element model through h- and p-convergence studies, and weak and strong scaling tests. Validation is performed against analytical solutions and experimental data for several benchmark cases, including nonlinear high-order harmonic generation and linear and nonlinear wave interactions with a cylinder and a breakwater. The new FNPF-SEM model offers a numerical framework for simulating wave propagation and wave-structure interactions, with the following key features: i) the ability to represent complex geometries through flexible, unstructured finite element meshes; ii) reduced numerical diffusion and dispersion by using high-order polynomial expansions; and iii) scalability to full- and large-scale simulations over long time periods through a parallel implementation.</p></details> | 23 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Time-Unified Diffusion Policy with Action Discrimination for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09422v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However, the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy (TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6% on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide range of real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches and datasets predominantly focus on static scenes or rigid transformations, limiting their capacity to handle expressive edits involving dynamic motion. To address this gap, we introduce ByteMorph, a comprehensive framework for instruction-based image editing with an emphasis on non-rigid motions. ByteMorph comprises a large-scale dataset, ByteMorph-6M, and a strong baseline model built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), named ByteMorpher. ByteMorph-6M includes over 6 million high-resolution image editing pairs for training, along with a carefully curated evaluation benchmark ByteMorph-Bench. Both capture a wide variety of non-rigid motion types across diverse environments, human figures, and object categories. The dataset is constructed using motion-guided data generation, layered compositing techniques, and automated captioning to ensure diversity, realism, and semantic coherence. We further conduct a comprehensive evaluation of recent instruction-based image editing methods from both academic and commercial domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://boese0601.github.io/bytemorph Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance-Seed/BM-6M Benchmark: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance-Seed/BM-Bench Code: https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/BM-code Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Boese0601/ByteMorph-Demo</p></details> |
| **[Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09416v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation (NCVSD), a novel method for distilling pretrained diffusion models into generative denoisers. We achieve this by revealing that the unconditional score function implicitly characterizes the score function of denoising posterior distributions. By integrating this insight into the Variational Score Distillation (VSD) framework, we enable scalable learning of generative denoisers capable of approximating samples from the denoising posterior distribution across a wide range of noise levels. The proposed generative denoisers exhibit desirable properties that allow fast generation while preserve the benefit of iterative refinement: (1) fast one-step generation through sampling from pure Gaussian noise at high noise levels; (2) improved sample quality by scaling the test-time compute with multi-step sampling; and (3) zero-shot probabilistic inference for flexible and controllable sampling. We evaluate NCVSD through extensive experiments, including class-conditional image generation and inverse problem solving. By scaling the test-time compute, our method outperforms teacher diffusion models and is on par with consistency models of larger sizes. Additionally, with significantly fewer NFEs than diffusion-based methods, we achieve record-breaking LPIPS on inverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speech Synthesis By Unrolling Diffusion Process using Neural Network Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09652v5)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces UDPNet, a novel architecture designed to accelerate the reverse diffusion process in speech synthesis. Unlike traditional diffusion models that rely on timestep embeddings and shared network parameters, UDPNet unrolls the reverse diffusion process directly into the network architecture, with successive layers corresponding to equally spaced steps in the diffusion schedule. Each layer progressively refines the noisy input, culminating in a high-fidelity estimation of the original data, \(x_0\). Additionally, we redefine the learning target by predicting latent variables instead of the conventional \(x_0\) or noise \(\epsilon_0\). This shift addresses the common issue of large prediction errors in early denoising stages, effectively reducing speech distortion. Extensive evaluations on single- and multi-speaker datasets demonstrate that UDPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quality and efficiency, while generalizing effectively to unseen speech. These results position UDPNet as a robust solution for real-time speech synthesis applications. Sample audio is available at https://onexpeters.github.io/UDPNet.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> |

However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention (TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment. When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead. We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance, attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models.

However, the frame-independence of T2I generation often results in poor temporal consistency. Existing methods address this issue through temporal layer fine-tuning or inference-based temporal propagation, but these approaches suffer from high training costs or limited temporal coherence. To address these challenges, we propose a General and Efficient Adapter (GE-Adapter) that integrates temporal-spatial and semantic consistency with Baliteral DDIM inversion. This framework introduces three key components: (1) Frame-based Temporal Consistency Blocks (FTC Blocks) to capture frame-specific features and enforce smooth inter-frame transitions via temporally-aware loss functions; (2) Channel-dependent Spatial Consistency Blocks (SCD Blocks) employing bilateral filters to enhance spatial coherence by reducing noise and artifacts; and (3) Token-based Semantic Consistency Module (TSC Module) to maintain semantic alignment using shared prompt tokens and frame-specific tokens. Our method significantly improves perceptual quality, text-image alignment, and temporal coherence, as demonstrated on the MSR-VTT dataset. Additionally, it achieves enhanced fidelity and frame-to-frame coherence, offering a practical solution for T2V editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Diffusion Models: From Generative Pre-training to One-Step Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09376v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion distillation is a widely used technique to reduce the sampling cost of diffusion models, yet it often requires extensive training, and the student performance tends to be degraded. Recent studies show that incorporating a GAN objective may alleviate these issues, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we first identify a key limitation of distillation: mismatched step sizes and parameter numbers between the teacher and the student model lead them to converge to different local minima, rendering direct imitation suboptimal. We further demonstrate that a standalone GAN objective, without relying a distillation loss, overcomes this limitation and is sufficient to convert diffusion models into efficient one-step generators. Based on this finding, we propose that diffusion training may be viewed as a form of generative pre-training, equipping models with capabilities that can be unlocked through lightweight GAN fine-tuning. Supporting this view, we create a one-step generation model by fine-tuning a pre-trained model with 85% of parameters frozen, achieving strong performance with only 0.2M images and near-SOTA results with 5M images. We further present a frequency-domain analysis that may explain the one-step generative capability gained in diffusion training. Overall, our work provides a new perspective for diffusion training, highlighting its role as a powerful generative pre-training process, which can be the basis for building efficient one-step generation models.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Despite its effectiveness, existing methods often struggle to comprehensively capture both long-term dynamic evolution and subtle local patterns in a unified manner. In this work, we propose \textbf{TimeDART}, a novel self-supervised time series pre-training framework that unifies two powerful generative paradigms to learn more transferable representations. Specifically, we first employ a causal Transformer encoder, accompanied by a patch-based embedding strategy, to model the evolving trends from left to right. Building on this global modeling, we further introduce a denoising diffusion process to capture fine-grained local patterns through forward diffusion and reverse denoising. Finally, we optimize the model in an autoregressive manner. As a result, TimeDART effectively accounts for both global and local sequence features in a coherent way. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets for time series forecasting and classification. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeDART consistently outperforms previous compared methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research questions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it, trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs. The code and weights will be open-sourced at https://github.com/KevinLight831/SAGE.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Autoregressive Adversarial Post-Training for Real-Time Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09350v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

| **[Pressure and convection robust Finite Elements for Magnetohydrodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05434v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose and analyze two convection quasi-robust and pressure robust finite element methods for a fully nonlinear time-dependent magnetohydrodynamics problem. Both methods employ the $H_{\rm div}$ conforming BDM element coupled with an appropriate pressure space guaranteeing the exact diagram for the fluid part, and the $H^1$ conforming Lagrange element for the approximation of the magnetic fluxes, and make use of suitable DG upwind terms and CIP stabilizations to handle the fluid and magnetic convective terms. The main difference between the two approaches here proposed (labeled as three-field scheme and four field-scheme respectively) lies in the strategy adopted to enforce the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field. The three-filed scheme implements a grad-div stabilization, whereas the four-field scheme introduces a suitable Lagrange multiplier and additional stabilization terms in the formulation. The developed error estimates for the two schemes are uniform in both diffusion parameters and optimal with respect to the diffusive norm. Furthermore, in the convection dominated regime, being $k$ the degree of the method and $h$ the mesh size, we are able to prove $O(h^k)$ and $O(h^{k+1/2})$ pre-asymptotic error reduction rate for the three-field scheme and four-filed scheme respectively. A set of numerical tests support our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

| **[polyGen: A Learning Framework for Atomic-level Polymer Structure Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17656v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges in the on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect conformational diversity. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers because of challenges in representation and dataset constraints. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first generative model designed specifically for polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone. polyGen combines graph-based encodings with a latent diffusion transformer using positional biased attention for realistic conformation generation. Given the limited dataset of 3,855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we incorporate joint training with small molecule data to enhance generation quality. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen overcomes the limitations of traditional crystal structure prediction methods for polymers, successfully generating realistic and diverse linear and branched conformations, with promising performance even on challenging large repeat units. As the first atomic-level proof-of-concept capturing intrinsic polymer flexibility, it marks a new capability in material structure generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion for System 2 Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07202v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for planning. However, unlike Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-whose performance naturally improves with inference-time computation scaling-standard diffusion-based planners offer only limited avenues for the scalability. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a novel framework that integrates the generative strength of diffusion models with the adaptive search capabilities of MCTS. Our method reconceptualizes denoising as a tree-structured process, allowing partially denoised plans to be iteratively evaluated, pruned, and refined. By selectively expanding promising trajectories while retaining the flexibility to revisit and improve suboptimal branches, MCTD achieves the benefits of MCTS such as controlling exploration-exploitation trade-offs within the diffusion framework. Empirical results on challenging long-horizon tasks show that MCTD outperforms diffusion baselines, yielding higher-quality solutions as inference-time computation increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, ICML 2025 Main Track Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Training-Free Guidance Beyond Differentiability: Scalable Path Steering with Tree Search in Diffusion and Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11420v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-free guidance enables controlled generation in diffusion and flow models, but most methods rely on gradients and assume differentiable objectives. This work focuses on training-free guidance addressing challenges from non-differentiable objectives and discrete data distributions. We propose TreeG: Tree Search-Based Path Steering Guidance, applicable to both continuous and discrete settings in diffusion and flow models. TreeG offers a unified framework for training-free guidance by proposing, evaluating, and selecting candidates at each step, enhanced with tree search over active paths and parallel exploration. We comprehensively investigate the design space of TreeG over the candidate proposal module and the evaluation function, instantiating TreeG into three novel algorithms. Our experiments show that TreeG consistently outperforms top guidance baselines in symbolic music generation, small molecule design, and enhancer DNA design with improvements of 29.01%, 16.6%, and 18.43%. Additionally, we identify an inference-time scaling law showing TreeG's scalability in inference-time computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[What is the Cost of Differential Privacy for Deep Learning-Based Trajectory Generation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09312v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While location trajectories offer valuable insights, they also reveal sensitive personal information. Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal protection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains challenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to produce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy guarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during generation. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such models, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven utility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method for deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models. (2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP mechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess its impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN - affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD significantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the datasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training stability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as GANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without guarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best non-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees. In conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal guarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Event-based Motion-Robust Accurate Shape Estimation for Mixed Reflectance Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09652v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based structured light systems have recently been introduced as an exciting alternative to conventional frame-based triangulation systems for the 3D measurements of diffuse surfaces. Important benefits include the fast capture speed and the high dynamic range provided by the event camera - albeit at the cost of lower data quality. So far, both low-accuracy event-based and high-accuracy frame-based 3D imaging systems are tailored to a specific surface type, such as diffuse or specular, and can not be used for a broader class of object surfaces ("mixed reflectance scenes"). In this work, we present a novel event-based structured light system that enables fast 3D imaging of mixed reflectance scenes with high accuracy. On the captured events, we use epipolar constraints that intrinsically enable decomposing the measured reflections into diffuse, two-bounce specular, and other multi-bounce reflections. The diffuse surfaces in the scene are reconstructed using triangulation. Then, the reconstructed diffuse scene parts are leveraged as a "display" to evaluate the specular scene parts via deflectometry. This novel procedure allows us to use the entire scene as a virtual screen, using only a scanning laser and an event camera. The resulting system achieves fast and motion-robust (14Hz) reconstructions of mixed reflectance scenes with < 600 ${\mu}m$ depth error. Moreover, we introduce an "ultrafast" capture mode (250Hz) for the 3D measurement of diffuse scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Stable Whitening Optimizer for Efficient Neural Network Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07254v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we take an experimentally grounded look at neural network optimization. Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and alleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we find that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached for long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a historical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in across-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements. Second, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across network width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large parameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks faster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed Transformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language modelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different stages of training. On average, SPlus is able to reach the validation performance of Adam within 44% of the gradient steps and 62% of the wallclock time.</p></details> |  |
| **[CFMI: Flow Matching for Missing Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09258v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce conditional flow matching for imputation (CFMI), a new general-purpose method to impute missing data. The method combines continuous normalising flows, flow-matching, and shared conditional modelling to deal with intractabilities of traditional multiple imputation. Our comparison with nine classical and state-of-the-art imputation methods on 24 small to moderate-dimensional tabular data sets shows that CFMI matches or outperforms both traditional and modern techniques across a wide range of metrics. Applying the method to zero-shot imputation of time-series data, we find that it matches the accuracy of a related diffusion-based method while outperforming it in terms of computational efficiency. Overall, CFMI performs at least as well as traditional methods on lower-dimensional data while remaining scalable to high-dimensional settings, matching or exceeding the performance of other deep learning-based approaches, making it a go-to imputation method for a wide range of data types and dimensionalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[The increasing fragmentation of global science limits the diffusion of ideas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05861v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global science is often portrayed as a unified system of shared knowledge and open exchange. Yet this vision contrasts with emerging evidence that scientific recognition is uneven and increasingly fragmented along regional and cultural lines. Traditional models emphasize Western dominance in knowledge production but overlook regional dynamics, reinforcing a core-periphery narrative that sustains disparities and marginalizes less prominent countries. In this study, we introduce a rank-based signed measure of national citation preferences, enabling the construction of a global recognition network that distinguishes over- and under-recognition between countries. Using a multinomial logistic link prediction model, we assess how economic, cultural, and scientific variables shape the presence and direction of national citation preferences. We uncover a global structure composed of multiple scientific communities, characterized by strong internal citation preferences and negative preferences between them-revealing growing fragmentation in the international scientific system. A separate weighted logistic regression framework suggests that this network significantly influences the international diffusion of scientific ideas, even after controlling for common covariates. Together, these findings highlight the structural barriers to equitable recognition and underscore the importance of scientific community membership in shaping influence, offering valuable insights for policymakers aiming to foster inclusive and impactful global science.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages (main text), 4 figures (main text), 1 table (main text)</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Frame Representation Alignment for Fine-Tuning Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09229v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) at the user level to generate videos that reflect specific attributes of training data presents notable challenges, yet remains underexplored despite its practical importance. Meanwhile, recent work such as Representation Alignment (REPA) has shown promise in improving the convergence and quality of DiT-based image diffusion models by aligning, or assimilating, its internal hidden states with external pretrained visual features, suggesting its potential for VDM fine-tuning. In this work, we first propose a straightforward adaptation of REPA for VDMs and empirically show that, while effective for convergence, it is suboptimal in preserving semantic consistency across frames. To address this limitation, we introduce Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA), a novel regularization technique that aligns hidden states of a frame with external features from neighboring frames. Empirical evaluations on large-scale VDMs, including CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, demonstrate that CREPA improves both visual fidelity and cross-frame semantic coherence when fine-tuned with parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA. We further validate CREPA across diverse datasets with varying attributes, confirming its broad applicability. Project page: https://crepavideo.github.io</p></details> | 24 pages, 25 figures |
| **[ReSpace: Text-Driven 3D Scene Synthesis and Editing with Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02459v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer graphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'), require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. In contrast, LLM-based methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with light wood furniture') but do not support editing, remain limited to rectangular layouts or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world models. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room boundaries that frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further introduce a novel voxelization-based evaluation that captures fine-grained geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass state-of-the-art on object addition while maintaining competitive results on full scene synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures (incl. appendix)</p></details> |
| **[Effective Data Augmentation With Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07944v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is one of the most prevalent tools in deep learning, underpinning many recent advances, including those from classification, generative models, and representation learning. The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on few-shot image classification tasks, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update to ICLR 2024 manuscript (https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZWzUA9zeAg), add leafy spurge citations</p></details> |
| **[Is Perturbation-Based Image Protection Disruptive to Image Editing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04394v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios, diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ICIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Pragmatic Jailbreak on Text-to-image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19149v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable advancements in terms of image quality and fidelity to textual prompts. Concurrently, the safety of such generative models has become an area of growing concern. This work introduces a novel type of jailbreak, which triggers T2I models to generate the image with visual text, where the image and the text, although considered to be safe in isolation, combine to form unsafe content. To systematically explore this phenomenon, we propose a dataset to evaluate the current diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models under such jailbreak. We benchmark nine representative T2I models, including two closed-source commercial models. Experimental results reveal a concerning tendency to produce unsafe content: all tested models suffer from such type of jailbreak, with rates of unsafe generation ranging from around 10\% to 70\% where DALLE 3 demonstrates almost the highest unsafety. In real-world scenarios, various filters such as keyword blocklists, customized prompt filters, and NSFW image filters, are commonly employed to mitigate these risks. We evaluate the effectiveness of such filters against our jailbreak and found that, while these filters may be effective for single modality detection, they fail to work against our jailbreak. We also investigate the underlying reason for such jailbreaks, from the perspective of text rendering capability and training data. Our work provides a foundation for further development towards more secure and reliable T2I models. Project page at https://multimodalpragmatic.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

We introduce LaDCast, the first global latent-diffusion framework for medium-range ensemble forecasting, which generates hourly ensemble forecasts entirely in a learned latent space. An autoencoder compresses high-dimensional ERA5 reanalysis fields into a compact representation, and a transformer-based diffusion model produces sequential latent updates with arbitrary hour initialization. The model incorporates Geometric Rotary Position Embedding (GeoRoPE) to account for the Earth's spherical geometry, a dual-stream attention mechanism for efficient conditioning, and sinusoidal temporal embeddings to capture seasonal patterns. LaDCast achieves deterministic and probabilistic skill close to that of the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecast IFS-ENS, without any explicit perturbations. Notably, LaDCast demonstrates superior performance in tracking rare extreme events such as cyclones, capturing their trajectories more accurately than established models. By operating in latent space, LaDCast reduces storage and compute by orders of magnitude, demonstrating a practical path toward forecasting at kilometer-scale resolution in real time. We open-source our code and models and provide the training and evaluation pipelines at: https://github.com/tonyzyl/ladcast.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Denoising Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21075v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Spatial Reasoning Models (SRMs), a framework to perform reasoning over sets of continuous variables via denoising generative models. SRMs infer continuous representations on a set of unobserved variables, given observations on observed variables. Current generative models on spatial domains, such as diffusion and flow matching models, often collapse to hallucination in case of complex distributions. To measure this, we introduce a set of benchmark tasks that test the quality of complex reasoning in generative models and can quantify hallucination. The SRM framework allows to report key findings about importance of sequentialization in generation, the associated order, as well as the sampling strategies during training. It demonstrates, for the first time, that order of generation can successfully be predicted by the denoising network itself. Using these findings, we can increase the accuracy of specific reasoning tasks from <1% to >50%.

A Unified Theory of Unconditional Graph Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22935v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explicit noise-level conditioning is widely regarded as essential for the effective operation of Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs). In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether denoisers can implicitly infer noise levels directly from corrupted graph structures, potentially eliminating the need for explicit noise conditioning. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework centered on Bernoulli edge-flip corruptions and extend it to encompass more complex scenarios involving coupled structure-attribute noise. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets, using models such as GDSS and DiGress, provide strong support for our theoretical findings. Notably, unconditional GDMs achieve performance comparable or superior to their conditioned counterparts, while also offering reductions in parameters (4-6%) and computation time (8-10%). Our results suggest that the high-dimensional nature of graph data itself often encodes sufficient information for the denoising process, opening avenues for simpler, more efficient GDM architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[MagCache: Fast Video Generation with Magnitude-Aware Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09045v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts. Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache) that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zehong-ma.github.io/MagCache</p></details> |

In this report, we introduce Seedance 1.0, a high-performance and inference-efficient video foundation generation model that integrates several core technical improvements: (i) multi-source data curation augmented with precision and meaningful video captioning, enabling comprehensive learning across diverse scenarios; (ii) an efficient architecture design with proposed training paradigm, which allows for natively supporting multi-shot generation and jointly learning of both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks.

Seedance 1.0 can generate a 5-second video at 1080p resolution only with 41.4 seconds (NVIDIA-L20). Compared to state-of-the-art video generation models, Seedance 1.0 stands out with high-quality and fast video generation having superior spatiotemporal fluidity with structural stability, precise instruction adherence in complex multi-subject contexts, native multi-shot narrative coherence with consistent subject representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Seeda...</summary><p>Seedance 1.0 Technical Report</p></details> |

These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Concept Replacement Techniques Really Erase Unacceptable Concepts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08991v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, particularly diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models, have demonstrated astounding success. However, aligning them to avoid generating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted content, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept replacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to "erase" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have started offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt as input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are known as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model to empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact erase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in emerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted concepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy between T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing unacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs to generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected fidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of targeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity. We present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.</p></details> |  |
