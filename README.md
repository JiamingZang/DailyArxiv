| **[RayPose: Ray Bundling Diffusion for Template Views in Unseen 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18521v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However, failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation, we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object pose estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GS2POSE: Marry Gaussian Splatting to 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16777v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D pose estimation of 3D objects is a fundamental task in computer vision, and current research typically predicts the 6D pose by establishing correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features. However, these methods often face difficulties with textureless objects and varying illumination conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GS2POSE, a novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and LineMod datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[DKPMV: Dense Keypoints Fusion from Multi-View RGB Frames for 6D Pose Estimation of Textureless Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10933v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance. In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training, improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects. Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[SenseShift6D: Multimodal RGB-D Benchmarking for Robust 6D Pose Estimation across Environment and Sensor Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05751v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation have achieved high performance on representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or depth-sensor mode-and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate such variations-largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures, 9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels. For five common household objects (spray, pringles, tincase, sandwich, and mouse), we acquire 166.4k RGB and 16.7k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our dataset demonstrate that applying multimodal sensor control at test time yields substantial performance gains, achieving a 19.5 pp improvement on pretrained generalizable models. It also enhances robustness precisely where those models tend to fail. Moreover, even instance-level pose estimators, where train and test set share identical object and background, performance still varies under environmental and sensor change, demonstrating that test-time sensor control remains effective compared to costly expansions in the quantity and diversity of real-world training data, without any additional training. SenseShift6D extends the object pose evaluation paradigm from data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive, self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Object 6D Pose Estimation with a Single Reference View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05578v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing novel object 6D pose estimation methods typically rely on CAD models or dense reference views, which are both difficult to acquire. Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in a common coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative object-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting. Code will be released at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/SinRef-6D.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures (including supplementary material)</p></details> |
| **[Joint Learning of Pose Regression and Denoising Diffusion with Score Scaling Sampling for Category-level 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04125v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latest diffusion models have shown promising results in category-level 6D object pose estimation by modeling the conditional pose distribution with depth image input. The existing methods, however, suffer from slow convergence during training, learning its encoder with the diffusion denoising network in end-to-end fashion, and require an additional network that evaluates sampled pose hypotheses to filter out low-quality pose candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline that tackles these limitations by two key components. First, the proposed method pretrains the encoder with the direct pose regression head, and jointly learns the networks via the regression head and the denoising diffusion head, significantly accelerating training convergence while achieving higher accuracy. Second, sampling guidance via time-dependent score scaling is proposed s.t. the exploration-exploitation trade-off is effectively taken, eliminating the need for the additional evaluation network. The sampling guidance maintains multi-modal characteristics of symmetric objects at early denoising steps while ensuring high-quality pose generation at final steps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including REAL275, HouseCat6D, and ROPE, demonstrate that the proposed method, simple yet effective, achieves state-of-the-art accuracies even with single-pose inference, while being more efficient in both training and inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Color-Pair Guided Robust Zero-Shot 6D Pose Estimation and Tracking of Cluttered Objects on Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23647v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker. The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through abrupt pose changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMD: A 6-DoF Pose Estimation Benchmark for Industrial Metallic Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11680v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object 6DoF (6D) pose estimation is essential for robotic perception, especially in industrial settings. It enables robots to interact with the environment and manipulate objects. However, existing benchmarks on object 6D pose estimation primarily use everyday objects with rich textures and low-reflectivity, limiting model generalization to industrial scenarios where objects are often metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective. To address this gap, we propose a novel dataset and benchmark namely \textit{Industrial Metallic Dataset (IMD)}, tailored for industrial applications. Our dataset comprises 45 true-to-scale industrial components, captured with an RGB-D camera under natural indoor lighting and varied object arrangements to replicate real-world conditions. The benchmark supports three tasks, including video object segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation. We evaluate existing state-of-the-art models, including XMem and SAM2 for segmentation, and BundleTrack and BundleSDF for pose estimation, to assess model performance in industrial contexts. Evaluation results show that our industrial dataset is more challenging than existing household object datasets. This benchmark provides the baseline for developing and comparing segmentation and pose estimation algorithms that better generalize to industrial robotics scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 19 figures, 2 tables.

| **[ActivePose: Active 6D Object Pose Estimation and Tracking for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11364v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6-DoF object pose estimation and tracking are critical for reliable robotic manipulation. However, zero-shot methods often fail under viewpoint-induced ambiguities and fixed-camera setups struggle when objects move or become self-occluded. To address these challenges, we propose an active pose estimation pipeline that combines a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with "robotic imagination" to dynamically detect and resolve ambiguities in real time. In an offline stage, we render a dense set of views of the CAD model, compute the FoundationPose entropy for each view, and construct a geometric-aware prompt that includes low-entropy (unambiguous) and high-entropy (ambiguous) examples. At runtime, the system: (1) queries the VLM on the live image for an ambiguity score; (2) if ambiguity is detected, imagines a discrete set of candidate camera poses by rendering virtual views, scores each based on a weighted combination of VLM ambiguity probability and FoundationPose entropy, and then moves the camera to the Next-Best-View (NBV) to obtain a disambiguated pose estimation. Furthermore, since moving objects may leave the camera's field of view, we introduce an active pose tracking module: a diffusion-policy trained via imitation learning, which generates camera trajectories that preserve object visibility and minimize pose ambiguity. Experiments in simulation and real-world show that our approach significantly outperforms classical baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6D Po...</summary><p>6D Pose, Diffusion Policy</p></details> |
| **[Aleatoric Uncertainty from AI-based 6D Object Pose Predictors for Object-relative State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01583v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the object-relative state estimation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[UnPose: Uncertainty-Guided Diffusion Priors for Zero-Shot Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15972v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However, acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available, we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent 3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2025.

| **[Learning Point Cloud Representations with Pose Continuity for Depth-Based Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14358v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25 benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at https://github.com/zhujunli1993/HRC-Pose.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 Workshop on Recovering 6D Object Pose (R6D)</p></details> |
| **[MR6D: Benchmarking 6D Pose Estimation for Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13775v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators, interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/anas-gouda/mr6d.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted CVPR 2025 Workshop on Recovering 6D Object Pose (R6D)</p></details> |
| **[RCGNet: RGB-based Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation with Geometric Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13623v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally, we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.</p></details> | Accepted by IROS2025 |
| **[Level-Set Parameters: Novel Representation for 3D Shape Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13502v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D shape analysis has been largely focused on traditional 3D representations of point clouds and meshes, but the discrete nature of these data makes the analysis susceptible to variations in input resolutions. Recent development of neural fields brings in level-set parameters from signed distance functions as a novel, continuous, and numerical representation of 3D shapes, where the shape surfaces are defined as zero-level-sets of those functions. This motivates us to extend shape analysis from the traditional 3D data to these novel parameter data. Since the level-set parameters are not Euclidean like point clouds, we establish correlations across different shapes by formulating them as a pseudo-normal distribution, and learn the distribution prior from the respective dataset. To further explore the level-set parameters with shape transformations, we propose to condition a subset of these parameters on rotations and translations, and generate them with a hypernetwork. This simplifies the pose-related shape analysis compared to using traditional data. We demonstrate the promise of the novel representations through applications in shape classification (arbitrary poses), retrieval, and 6D object pose estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask6D: Masked Pose Priors For 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06486v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous end-to-end pose estimation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2024. 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Computer Vision for Objects used in Group Work: Challenges and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00224v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive and spatially aware technologies are transforming educational frameworks, particularly in K-12 settings where hands-on exploration fosters deeper conceptual understanding. However, during collaborative tasks, existing systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale. This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods' object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results, and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AIED 2025 Late Breaking Results Track</p></details> |
| **[Monocular One-Shot Metric-Depth Alignment for RGB-Based Robot Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17110v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision, which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras), and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

The dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on household objects, which approach saturation,XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved realistic industrial conditions. The dataset features 15 texture-less, metallic, and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density, replicating the challenges of real-world bin-picking. XYZ-IBD was collected using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view real-world scenes, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks. By capturing the complexity of real-world bin-picking scenarios, XYZ-IBD introduces more realistic and challenging problems for future research.

| **[In-Hand Object Pose Estimation via Visual-Tactile Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10787v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate in-hand pose estimation is crucial for robotic object manipulation, but visual occlusion remains a major challenge for vision-based approaches. This paper presents an approach to robotic in-hand object pose estimation, combining visual and tactile information to accurately determine the position and orientation of objects grasped by a robotic hand. We address the challenge of visual occlusion by fusing visual information from a wrist-mounted RGB-D camera with tactile information from vision-based tactile sensors mounted on the fingertips of a robotic gripper. Our approach employs a weighting and sensor fusion module to combine point clouds from heterogeneous sensor types and control each modality's contribution to the pose estimation process. We use an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm adapted for weighted point clouds to estimate the 6D object pose. Our experiments show that incorporating tactile information significantly improves pose estimation accuracy, particularly when occlusion is high. Our method achieves an average pose estimation error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only baselines by up to 20%. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to perform precise object manipulation in a real-world insertion task.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Accurate and efficient zero-shot 6D pose estimation with frozen foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09784v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable 8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[CHIP: A multi-sensor dataset for 6D pose estimation of chairs in industrial settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09699v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D pose estimation of complex objects in 3D environments is essential for effective robotic manipulation. Yet, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating 6D pose estimation methods under realistic industrial conditions, as most datasets focus on household objects in domestic settings, while the few available industrial datasets are limited to artificial setups with objects placed on tables. To bridge this gap, we introduce CHIP, the first dataset designed for 6D pose estimation of chairs manipulated by a robotic arm in a real-world industrial environment. CHIP includes seven distinct chairs captured using three different RGBD sensing technologies and presents unique challenges, such as distractor objects with fine-grained differences and severe occlusions caused by the robotic arm and human operators. CHIP comprises 77,811 RGBD images annotated with ground-truth 6D poses automatically derived from the robot's kinematics, averaging 11,115 annotations per chair.

| **[UA-Pose: Uncertainty-Aware 6D Object Pose Estimation and Online Object Completion with Partial References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07996v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects. However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed 3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating 6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are incomplete or partially captured.

Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, effectively utilizing such speeds remains a challenge due to the limitations of RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and fail to provide real-time responsiveness. Event cameras, with their asynchronous operation, and low-latency sensing, offer a promising alternative for high-speed robotic perception. In this work, we introduce MTevent, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation and moving object detection in highly dynamic environments with large detection distances. Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an RGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16 unique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles, varying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine high-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions, making it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To establish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's FoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with ground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in such dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve perception models and foster further research in high-speed robotic vision.

The vast majority of existing methods rely on instance-specific CAD models or require depth sensors to resolve geometric ambiguities, making them impractical for real-world agricultural applications. In this work, we introduce PLANTPose, a novel framework for category-level 6D pose estimation that operates purely on RGB input. PLANTPose predicts both the 6D pose and deformation parameters relative to a base mesh, allowing a single category-level CAD model to adapt to unseen instances. This enables accurate pose estimation across varying shapes without relying on instance-specific data. To enhance realism and improve generalization, we also leverage Stable Diffusion to refine synthetic training images with realistic texturing, mimicking variations due to ripeness and environmental factors and bridging the domain gap between synthetic data and the real world. Our evaluations on a challenging benchmark that includes bananas of various shapes, sizes, and ripeness status demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in handling large intraclass variations while maintaining accurate 6D pose predictions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art RGB-based approach MegaPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

| **[RefPose: Leveraging Reference Geometric Correspondences for Accurate 6D Pose Estimation of Unseen Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10841v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of unseen objects from monocular RGB images remains a challenging problem, especially due to the lack of prior object-specific knowledge. To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to object pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric correspondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using object templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric correspondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage, RefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the generated references and iteratively refines the pose through a render-and-compare approach. To enhance this estimation, we introduce a correlation volume-guided attention mechanism that effectively captures correlations between the query and reference images. Unlike traditional methods that depend on pre-defined object models, RefPose dynamically adapts to new object shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence. This results in robust performance across previously unseen objects. Extensive evaluation on the BOP benchmark datasets shows that RefPose achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining a competitive runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

These requirements make generalization to novel objects difficult for which neither 3D models nor multi-view images may be available. To address this, we propose a novel method One2Any that estimates the relative 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) object pose using only a single reference-single query RGB-D image, without prior knowledge of its 3D model, multi-view data, or category constraints. We treat object pose estimation as an encoding-decoding process, first, we obtain a comprehensive Reference Object Pose Embedding (ROPE) that encodes an object shape, orientation, and texture from a single reference view. Using this embedding, a U-Net-based pose decoding module produces Reference Object Coordinate (ROC) for new views, enabling fast and accurate pose estimation. This simple encoding-decoding framework allows our model to be trained on any pair-wise pose data, enabling large-scale training and demonstrating great scalability. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model generalizes well to novel objects, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness even rivaling methods that require multi-view or CAD inputs, at a fraction of compute.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

The complexity of a pose estimation task depends on the unknown variables related to the target object. While instance-level methods already excel for opaque and Lambertian objects, category-level and open-set methods, where texture, shape, and size are partially or entirely unknown, still struggle with these basic material properties. Since texture is unknown in these scenarios, it cannot be used for disambiguating object symmetries, another core challenge of 6D object pose estimation. The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of unknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions. This paper compares datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithms for solving 6D pose estimation on the category-level. Based on this comparison, we analyze how to bridge category-level and open-set object pose estimation to reach generalization and provide actionable recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Austrian Robotics Workshop 2025</p></details> |

Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have shown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal. However, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems: (1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is significantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and occlusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack crucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations, we propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns correspondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and robot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware point clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand. These point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also incorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in six real-world tasks, surpassing other baselines by a large margin. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness of CordViP to different objects, viewpoints, and scenarios.

In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have similar rankings on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21--29% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still -35% behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023), and the 2D detection stage is consequently the main bottleneck of existing pipelines for 6D localization/detection of unseen objects.

While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Most recent 6D object pose methods rely on refinement to get accurate results. However, most existing refinement methods either suffer from noises in establishing correspondences, or rely on retraining for novel objects. SCFlow2 is based on the SCFlow model designed for refinement with shape constraint, but formulates the additional depth as a regularization in the iteration via 3D scene flow for RGBD frames. The key design of SCFlow2 is an introduction of geometry constraints into the training of recurrent matching network, by combining the rigid-motion embeddings in 3D scene flow and 3D shape prior of the target. We train SCFlow2 on a combination of dataset Objaverse, GSO and ShapeNet, and evaluate on BOP datasets with novel objects. After using our method as a post-processing, most state-of-the-art methods produce significantly better results, without any retraining or fine-tuning.

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |

Based on our novel positional depth encoding, we enable stable depth density and depth distribution invariant feature extraction. We achieve performance improvements and SOTA results across a spectrum of relevant RGBD downstream tasks - without the necessity of finetuning the encoder. Most notably, we achieve 56.05 mIoU on SUN-RGBD segmentation, 88.3 RMSE on Void's depth completion, and 83.8 Top 1 accuracy on NYUv2 scene classification. In 6D-object pose estimation, we outperform our predecessors of DinoV2, EVA-02, and Omnivore and achieve SOTA results for non-finetuned encoders in several related RGBD downstream tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Recently, the emergence of deep learning reveals the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict reliable 6D poses. Given that direct pose regression networks currently exhibit suboptimal performance, most methods still resort to traditional techniques to varying degrees. For example, top-performing methods often adopt an indirect strategy by first establishing 2D-3D or 3D-3D correspondences followed by applying the RANSAC-based PnP or Kabsch algorithms, and further employing ICP for refinement. Despite the performance enhancement, the integration of traditional techniques makes the networks time-consuming and not end-to-end trainable. Orthogonal to them, this paper introduces a fully learning-based object pose estimator. In this work, we first perform an in-depth investigation of both direct and indirect methods and propose a simple yet effective Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDRN) to learn the 6D pose from monocular images in an end-to-end manner. Afterwards, we introduce a geometry-guided pose refinement module, enhancing pose accuracy when extra depth data is available. Guided by the predicted coordinate map, we build an end-to-end differentiable architecture that establishes robust and accurate 3D-3D correspondences between the observed and rendered RGB-D images to refine the pose. Our enhanced pose estimation pipeline GDRNPP (GDRN Plus Plus) conquered the leaderboard of the BOP Challenge for two consecutive years, becoming the first to surpass all prior methods that relied on traditional techniques in both accuracy and speed.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Omni6D, a comprehensive RGBD dataset featuring a wide range of categories and varied backgrounds, elevating the task to a more realistic context. 1) The dataset comprises an extensive spectrum of 166 categories, 4688 instances adjusted to the canonical pose, and over 0.8 million captures, significantly broadening the scope for evaluation. 2) We introduce a symmetry-aware metric and conduct systematic benchmarks of existing algorithms on Omni6D, offering a thorough exploration of new challenges and insights. 3) Additionally, we propose an effective fine-tuning approach that adapts models from previous datasets to our extensive vocabulary setting.

While prior works use large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rewards, these approaches are largely limited to simple tasks with well-defined rewards, such as pick-and-place. This limitation arises because LLMs struggle to interpret complex scenes compressed into text or code due to their restricted input modality, while VLM-based rewards, though better at visual perception, remain limited by their less expressive output modality. To address these challenges, we leverage the imagination capability of general-purpose video generation models. Given an initial simulation frame and a textual task description, the video generation model produces a video demonstrating task completion with correct semantics. We then extract rich supervisory signals from the generated video, including 6D object pose sequences, 2D segmentations, and estimated depth, to facilitate task learning in simulation. Our approach significantly improves supervision quality for complex embodied tasks, enabling large-scale training in simulators.</p></details> |  |

Zero-shot approaches eliminate the need for training but depend on pre-existing 3D object models, which are often impractical to obtain. To address this, we propose a language-guided few-shot 3D reconstruction method, reconstructing a 3D mesh from few input images. In the proposed pipeline, receives a set of input images and a language query. A combination of GroundingDINO and Segment Anything Model outputs segmented masks from which a sparse point cloud is reconstructed with VGGSfM. Subsequently, the mesh is reconstructed with the Gaussian Splatting method SuGAR. In a final cleaning step, artifacts are removed, resulting in the final 3D mesh of the queried object. We evaluate the method in terms of accuracy and quality of the geometry and texture. Furthermore, we study the impact of imaging conditions such as viewing angle, number of input images, and image overlap on 3D object reconstruction quality, efficiency, and computational scalability.</p></details> | under review |

Existing studies either require multi-stage pose regression or rely on 2D-3D feature matching. Though these approaches have shown promising results, they rely heavily on appearance information, requiring complex input (i.e., multi-view reference input, depth, or CAD models) and intricate pipeline (i.e., feature extraction-SfM-2D to 3D matching-PnP). We propose AxisPose, a model-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation, which fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing methods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM and PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by leveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects without reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation Module (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes through a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the gradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain the geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated tri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module (TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose achieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N instances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with great potential for generalization to unseen-object level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active 6D Pose Estimation for Textureless Objects using Multi-View RGB Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03726v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of textureless objects from RBG images is an important problem in robotics. Due to appearance ambiguities, rotational symmetries, and severe occlusions, single-view based 6D pose estimators are still unable to handle a wide range of objects, motivating research towards multi-view pose estimation and next-best-view prediction that addresses these limitations. In this work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for estimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our approach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a sequential two-step process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency. First, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth ambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify the subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through canonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then introduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera viewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty and enhancing pose accuracy. We evaluate our method on the public ROBI dataset as well as on a transparent object dataset that we created. When evaluated using the same camera viewpoints, our multi-view pose estimation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by leveraging our next-best-view strategy, our method achieves high object pose accuracy with substantially fewer viewpoints than heuristic-based policies.</p></details> |  |

We set out to improve the state-of-the-art by addressing challenges such as reflections and specular highlights in industrial applications. Our novel BOP-compatible dataset, featuring a diverse set of metallic objects (cans, household, and industrial items) under various lighting and background conditions, provides additional geometric and visual cues. We demonstrate that these cues can be effectively leveraged to enhance overall performance. To illustrate the usefulness of the additional features, we improve upon the GDRNPP algorithm by introducing an additional keypoint prediction and material estimator head in order to improve spatial scene understanding. Evaluations on the new dataset show improved accuracy for metallic objects, supporting the hypothesis that additional geometric and visual cues can improve learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Increasing the Task Flexibility of Heavy-Duty Manipulators Using Visual 6D Pose Estimation of Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19169v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in visual 6D pose estimation of objects using deep neural networks have enabled novel ways of vision-based control for heavy-duty robotic applications. In this study, we present a pipeline for the precise tool positioning of heavy-duty, long-reach (HDLR) manipulators using advanced machine vision. A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration to estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI). Based on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with motion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool positioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and control methods prevalent in the industry. The proposed methodology comprises orientation and position alignment based on the visually estimated OOI poses, whereas camera-to-robot calibration is conducted based on motion utilizing visual SLAM. The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from rigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via image-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation, only synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world setting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results demonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2 mm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to increase the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR manipulators.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances improving speed and accuracy in pose estimation, finding a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy poses significant challenges in dynamic environments. Most current algorithms lack scalability in estimation time, especially for diverse datasets, and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are often too slow. This study focuses on developing a fast and scalable set of pose estimators based on GDRNPP to meet or exceed current benchmarks in accuracy and robustness, particularly addressing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off essential in real-time scenarios. We propose the AMIS algorithm to tailor the utilized model according to an application-specific trade-off between inference time and accuracy. We further show the effectiveness of the AMIS-based model choice on four prominent benchmark datasets (LM-O, YCB-V, T-LESS, and ITODD).</p></details> |  |

While existing methods can estimate the precise 6D pose of objects, they heavily rely on curated CAD models or reference images, the preparation of which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, 3D models or reference images may not be available in advance and instant robot reaction is desired. In this work, we propose a novel framework named HIPPo, which eliminates the need for curated CAD models and reference images by harnessing image-to-3D priors from Diffusion Models, enabling model-free zero-shot 6D pose estimation. Specifically, we construct HIPPo Dreamer, a rapid image-to-mesh model built on a multiview Diffusion Model and a 3D reconstruction foundation model. Our HIPPo Dreamer can generate a 3D mesh of any unseen objects from a single glance in just a few seconds. Then, as more observations are acquired, we propose to continuously refine the diffusion prior mesh model by joint optimization of object geometry and appearance. This is achieved by a measurement-guided scheme that gradually replaces the plausible diffusion priors with more reliable online observations. Consequently, HIPPo can instantly estimate and track the 6D pose of a novel object and maintain a complete mesh for immediate robotic applications. Thorough experiments on various benchmarks show that HIPPo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 6D object pose estimation when prior reference images are limited.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes an improved 6D object detection and pose estimation pipeline based on the existing 6D-VNet framework, enhanced by integrating a Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC) and a High-Resolution Network (HRNet) backbone. By leveraging the strengths of HTC's multi-stage refinement process and HRNet's ability to maintain high-resolution representations, our approach significantly improves detection accuracy and pose estimation precision. Furthermore, we introduce advanced post-processing techniques and a novel model integration strategy that collectively contribute to superior performance on public and private benchmarks. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models, making it a valuable contribution to the domain of 6D object detection and pose estimation.</p></details> |  |

Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve ambiguous cases due to geometrically symmetric objects that is based on visual features. We comprehensively evaluate FreeZe across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, which include over a hundred 3D objects and 20,000 images captured in various scenarios. FreeZe consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches, including competitors extensively trained on synthetic 6D pose estimation data.

Traditional methods often rely on deep learning with grid based data structures but struggle to capture complex dependencies among extracted features. To overcome this, we introduce a graph based representation derived directly from images, where spatial temporal features of each pixel serve as nodes, and relationships between them are defined through node connectivity and spatial interactions. We also employ feature selection mechanisms that use spatial attention and self attention distillation, along with a Legendre convolution layer leveraging the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials for numerical stability.

However, they present a major challenge due to their distinct refractive and reflective properties when it comes to accurately estimating the 6D pose. To solve this, we present ReFlow6D, a novel method for transparent object 6D pose estimation that harnesses the refractive-intermediate representation. Unlike conventional approaches, our method leverages a feature space impervious to changes in RGB image space and independent of depth information. Drawing inspiration from image matting, we model the deformation of the light path through transparent objects, yielding a unique object-specific intermediate representation guided by light refraction that is independent of the environment in which objects are observed. By integrating these intermediate features into the pose estimation network, we show that ReFlow6D achieves precise 6D pose estimation of transparent objects, using only RGB images as input. Our method further introduces a novel transparent object compositing loss, fostering the generation of superior refractive-intermediate features. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TOD and Trans32K-6D datasets. Robot grasping experiments further demonstrate that ReFlow6D's pose estimation accuracy effectively translates to real-world robotics task.

Existing real-world datasets primarily focus on table-top grasping scenarios, where a robot arm is placed in a fixed position and the objects are centralized within the FOV of fixed external camera(s). Assessing performance on such datasets may not accurately reflect the challenges encountered in everyday grasping and mobile manipulation tasks within kitchen environments such as retrieving objects from higher shelves, sinks, dishwashers, ovens, refrigerators, or microwaves. To address this gap, we present KITchen, a novel benchmark designed specifically for estimating the 6D poses of objects located in diverse positions within kitchen settings. For this purpose, we recorded a comprehensive dataset comprising around 205k real-world RGBD images for 111 kitchen objects captured in two distinct kitchens, utilizing a humanoid robot with its egocentric perspectives. Subsequently, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline, to streamline the labeling process of such datasets, resulting in the generation of 2D object labels, 2D object segmentation masks, and 6D object poses with minimal human effort. The benchmark, the dataset, and the annotation pipeline will be publicly available at https://kitchen-dataset.github.io/KITchen.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publishing at The 2024 IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots</p></details> |

Our approach relies on the evaluation of discrepancies in the geometry of the observed object, in particular its respective estimated back-projection in 3D, against a putative functional shape representation comprising mixtures of Gaussian Processes, that act as a template. Each Gaussian Process is trained to yield a fragment of the object's surface in a radial fashion with respect to designated reference points. We further define a pose confidence measure as the average probability of pixel back-projections in the Gaussian mixture. The goal of our experiments is two-fold. a) We demonstrate that our functional representation is sufficiently accurate as a shape template on which the probability of back-projected object points can be evaluated, and, b) we show that the resulting confidence scores based on these probabilities are indeed a consistent quality measure of pose.</p></details> |  |

Most current approaches are restricted to specific instances with known models or require ground truth depth information or point cloud captures from LIDAR. We tackle the harder problem of pose estimation for category-level objects from a single RGB image. We propose a novel solution that eliminates the need for specific object models or depth information. Our method utilises score-based diffusion models to generate object pose hypotheses to model the distribution of possible poses for the object. Unlike previous methods that rely on costly trained likelihood estimators to remove outliers before pose aggregation using mean pooling, we introduce a simpler approach using Mean Shift to estimate the mode of the distribution as the final pose estimate. Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the REAL275 dataset by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

Through evaluation of the model performance with respect to the distribution of object poses and occlusions, we discover regions of high error and generate realistic training samples to specifically target these regions.

In particular, partial observability, occlusions, and object symmetries eventually result in pose ambiguity. To account for this multimodality, this work proposes training a diffusion-based generative model for 6D object pose estimation. During inference, the trained generative model allows for sampling multiple particles, i.e., pose hypotheses. To distill this information into a single pose estimate, we propose two novel and effective pose selection strategies that do not require any additional training or computationally intensive operations. Moreover, while many existing methods for pose estimation primarily focus on the image domain and only incorporate depth information for final pose refinement, our model solely operates on point cloud data. The model thereby leverages recent advancements in point cloud processing and operates upon an SE(3)-equivariant latent space that forms the basis for the particle selection strategies and allows for improved inference times. Our thorough experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach on the Linemod dataset and showcase the effectiveness of our design choices.

Occlusion and incomplete object visibility are common challenges in this task, but existing pose refinement methods often struggle to handle these issues effectively. To tackle this problem, we propose a global motion-guided recurrent flow estimation method called GMFlow for pose estimation. GMFlow overcomes local ambiguities caused by occlusion or missing parts by seeking global explanations. We leverage the object's structural information to extend the motion of visible parts of the rigid body to its invisible regions. Specifically, we capture global contextual information through a linear attention mechanism and guide local motion information to generate global motion estimates. Furthermore, we introduce object shape constraints in the flow iteration process, making flow estimation suitable for pose estimation scenarios. Experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in accuracy while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose can utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD model, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input. Specifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse estimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight U-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is designed. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images. GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly competitive results. The code for GS2Pose will soon be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce Modular Quantization-Aware Training (MQAT), an adaptive and mixed-precision quantization-aware training strategy that exploits the modular structure of modern 6D pose estimation architectures. MQAT guides a systematic gradated modular quantization sequence and determines module-specific bit precisions, leading to quantized models that outperform those produced by state-of-the-art uniform and mixed-precision quantization techniques. Our experiments showcase the generality of MQAT across datasets, architectures, and quantization algorithms. Remarkably, MQAT-trained quantized models achieve a significant accuracy boost (>7%) over the baseline full-precision network while reducing model size by a factor of 4x or more.

However, existing classic pose estimation methods are object-specific, which can only handle the specific objects seen during training. When applied to a novel object, these methods necessitate a cumbersome onboarding process, which involves extensive dataset preparation and model retraining. The extensive duration and resource consumption of onboarding limit their practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce ZeroPose, a novel zero-shot framework that performs pose estimation following a Discovery-Orientation-Registration (DOR) inference pipeline. This framework generalizes to novel objects without requiring model retraining. Given the CAD model of a novel object, ZeroPose enables in seconds onboarding time to extract visual and geometric embeddings from the CAD model as a prompt. With the prompting of the above embeddings, DOR can discover all related instances and estimate their 6D poses without additional human interaction or presupposing scene conditions. Compared with existing zero-shot methods solved by the render-and-compare paradigm, the DOR pipeline formulates the object pose estimation into a feature-matching problem, which avoids time-consuming online rendering and improves efficiency. Experimental results on the seven datasets show that ZeroPose as a zero-shot method achieves comparable performance with object-specific training methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot method with 50x inference speed improvement.</p></details> |  |

This problem is of particular interest for many practical applications in industrial tasks such as quality control, bin picking, and robotic manipulation, where both speed and accuracy are critical for real-world deployment. Current models, both classical and deep-learning-based, often struggle with the trade-off between accuracy and latency. Our research focuses on enhancing the speed of a prominent state-of-the-art deep learning model, GDRNPP, while keeping its high accuracy.

State-of-the-art 6D object pose estimators directly predict an object pose given an object observation. Due to the ill-posed nature of the pose estimation problem, where multiple different poses can correspond to a single observation, generating additional plausible estimates per observation can be valuable. To address this, we reformulate the state-of-the-art algorithm GDRNPP and introduce EPRO-GDR (End-to-End Probabilistic Geometry-Guided Regression). Instead of predicting a single pose per detection, we estimate a probability density distribution of the pose. Using the evaluation procedure defined by the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) Challenge, we test our approach on four of its core datasets and demonstrate superior quantitative results for EPRO-GDR on LM-O, YCB-V, and ITODD. Our probabilistic solution shows that predicting a pose distribution instead of a single pose can improve state-of-the-art single-view pose estimation while providing the additional benefit of being able to sample multiple meaningful pose candidates.</p></details> |  |

In this context, RGB image and point-cloud observations are two commonly used modalities in visual-based robotic manipulation, but each of these modalities have their own limitations. Commercial point-cloud observations often suffer from issues like sparse sampling and noisy output due to the limits of the emission-reception imaging principle. On the other hand, RGB images, while rich in texture information, lack essential depth and 3D information crucial for robotic manipulation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an image-only robotic manipulation framework that leverages an eye-on-hand monocular camera installed on the robot's parallel gripper. By moving with the robot gripper, this camera gains the ability to actively perceive object from multiple perspectives during the manipulation process. This enables the estimation of 6D object poses, which can be utilized for manipulation. While, obtaining images from more and diverse viewpoints typically improves pose estimation, it also increases the manipulation time. To address this trade-off, we employ a reinforcement learning policy to synchronize the manipulation strategy with active perception, achieving a balance between 6D pose accuracy and manipulation efficiency. Our experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments showcase the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our approach. %, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve robust real-world robotic manipulation through active pose estimation.

To detect and grasp novel objects, zero-shot pose estimators determine poses without prior knowledge. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have shown considerable advances in robotics applications by establishing an understanding between language input and image input. In our work, we take advantage of VLMs zero-shot capabilities and translate this ability to 6D object pose estimation. We propose a novel framework for promptable zero-shot 6D object pose estimation using language embeddings. The idea is to derive a coarse location of an object based on the relevancy map of a language-embedded NeRF reconstruction and to compute the pose estimate with a point cloud registration method. Additionally, we provide an analysis of LERF's suitability for open-set object pose estimation. We examine hyperparameters, such as activation thresholds for relevancy maps and investigate the zero-shot capabilities on an instance- and category-level. Furthermore, we plan to conduct robotic grasping experiments in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |

Object 3D reconstruction methods offer an alternative, among which recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) afford a compelling potential. Yet its performance still suffers and tends to overfit with fewer input views. Embracing this challenge, we introduce SGPose, a novel framework for sparse view object pose estimation using Gaussian-based methods. Given as few as ten views, SGPose generates a geometric-aware representation by starting with a random cuboid initialization, eschewing reliance on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline-derived geometry as required by traditional 3DGS methods. SGPose removes the dependence on CAD models by regressing dense 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model from sparse input and random initialization, while the geometric-consistent depth supervision and online synthetic view warping are key to the success. Experiments on typical benchmarks, especially on the Occlusion LM-O dataset, demonstrate that SGPose outperforms existing methods even under sparse view constraints, under-scoring its potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

GS-Pose begins with a set of posed RGB images of a previously unseen object and builds three distinct representations stored in a database. At inference, GS-Pose operates sequentially by locating the object in the input image, estimating its initial 6D pose using a retrieval approach, and refining the pose with a render-and-compare method. The key insight is the application of the appropriate object representation at each stage of the process. In particular, for the refinement step, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique that offers high rendering speed and relatively low optimization time. Off-the-shelf toolchains and commodity hardware, such as mobile phones, can be used to capture new objects to be added to the database. Extensive evaluations on the LINEMOD and OnePose-LowTexture datasets demonstrate excellent performance, establishing the new state-of-the-art.

We initially detect instance-wise keypoints with a YOLOv8s model to compute 6D pose estimates of known objects by solving PnP. We use a ray tracing approach to track a geometric scene graph consisting of mesh models of object instances. In contrast to classical point-to-point matching, this leads to more robust results, especially under occlusions between objects instances. We show that using this hybrid strategy leads to robust self-localization, pre-segmentation of the range sensor data and accurate pose tracking of objects using the same environmental representation. All detected objects are integrated into a semantic scene graph. This scene graph then serves as a front end to a semantic mapping framework to allow spatial reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certifying Robustness of Learning-Based Keypoint Detection and Pose Estimation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00117v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the certification of the local robustness of vision-based two-stage 6D object pose estimation. The two-stage method for object pose estimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural network-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods' robustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on their local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust estimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform the certification of local robustness into neural network verification for classification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output specifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate verification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear operations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of injecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull representation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict semantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we propagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then formulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the setting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each pixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear, classification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both sound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on realistic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to certify the robustness of large-scale, keypoint-based pose estimation given images in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Unlike most existing real-world object-centric datasets which only come with RGB capturing, the direct capture of the depth channel allows better 3D annotations and broader downstream applications. WildRGB-D comprises large-scale category-level RGB-D object videos, which are taken using an iPhone to go around the objects in 360 degrees. It contains around 8500 recorded objects and nearly 20000 RGB-D videos across 46 common object categories. These videos are taken with diverse cluttered backgrounds with three setups to cover as many real-world scenarios as possible: (i) a single object in one video; (ii) multiple objects in one video; and (iii) an object with a static hand in one video. The dataset is annotated with object masks, real-world scale camera poses, and reconstructed aggregated point clouds from RGBD videos. We benchmark four tasks with WildRGB-D including novel view synthesis, camera pose estimation, object 6d pose estimation, and object surface reconstruction. Our experiments show that the large-scale capture of RGB-D objects provides a large potential to advance 3D object learning.

The widely available, inexpensive and high-resolution RGB sensors and CNNs that allow for fast inference based on this modality make monocular approaches especially well suited for robotics applications. We observe that previous surveys on object pose estimation establish the state of the art for varying modalities, single- and multi-view settings, and datasets and metrics that consider a multitude of applications. We argue, however, that those works' broad scope hinders the identification of open challenges that are specific to monocular approaches and the derivation of promising future challenges for their application in robotics. By providing a unified view on recent publications from both robotics and computer vision, we find that occlusion handling, novel pose representations, and formalizing and improving category-level pose estimation are still fundamental challenges that are highly relevant for robotics. Moreover, to further improve robotic performance, large object sets, novel objects, refractive materials, and uncertainty estimates are central, largely unsolved open challenges. In order to address them, ontological reasoning, deformability handling, scene-level reasoning, realistic datasets, and the ecological footprint of algorithms need to be improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Transactions on Robotics: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609560 arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.11827</p></details> |
| **[Shape-biased Texture Agnostic Representations for Improved Textureless and Metallic Object Detection and 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04878v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in machine learning have greatly benefited object detection and 6D pose estimation. However, textureless and metallic objects still pose a significant challenge due to few visual cues and the texture bias of CNNs. To address his issue, we propose a strategy for inducing a shape bias to CNN training. In particular, by randomizing textures applied to object surfaces during data rendering, we create training data without consistent textural cues. This methodology allows for seamless integration into existing data rendering engines, and results in negligible computational overhead for data rendering and network training. Our findings demonstrate that the shape bias we induce via randomized texturing, improves over existing approaches using style transfer. We evaluate with three detectors and two pose estimators. For the most recent object detector and for pose estimation in general, estimation accuracy improves for textureless and metallic objects. Additionally we show that our approach increases the pose estimation accuracy in the presence of image noise and strong illumination changes. Code and datasets are publicly available at github.com/hoenigpeter/randomized_texturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[FoundPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with Foundation Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18809v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FoundPose, a model-based method for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single RGB image. The method can quickly onboard new objects using their 3D models without requiring any object- or task-specific training. In contrast, existing methods typically pre-train on large-scale, task-specific datasets in order to generalize to new objects and to bridge the image-to-model domain gap. We demonstrate that such generalization capabilities can be observed in a recent vision foundation model trained in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, our method estimates the object pose from image-to-model 2D-3D correspondences, which are established by matching patch descriptors from the recent DINOv2 model between the image and pre-rendered object templates. We find that reliable correspondences can be established by kNN matching of patch descriptors from an intermediate DINOv2 layer. Such descriptors carry stronger positional information than descriptors from the last layer, and we show their importance when semantic information is ambiguous due to object symmetries or a lack of texture. To avoid establishing correspondences against all object templates, we develop an efficient template retrieval approach that integrates the patch descriptors into the bag-of-words representation and can promptly propose a handful of similarly looking templates. Additionally, we apply featuremetric alignment to compensate for discrepancies in the 2D-3D correspondences caused by coarse patch sampling. The resulting method noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for refinement-free pose estimation on the standard BOP benchmark with seven diverse datasets and can be seamlessly combined with an existing render-and-compare refinement method to achieve RGB-only state-of-the-art results.

Both factors limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a pipeline that does not require CAD models and allows training a state-of-the-art pose estimator requiring only a small set of real images as input. Our method is based on a NeuS2 object representation, that we learn through a semi-automated procedure based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and object-agnostic segmentation. We exploit the novel-view synthesis ability of NeuS2 and simple cut-and-paste augmentation to automatically generate photorealistic object renderings, which we use to train the correspondence-based SurfEmb pose estimator. We evaluate our method on the LINEMOD-Occlusion dataset, extensively studying the impact of its individual components and showing competitive performance with respect to approaches based on CAD models and PBR data. We additionally demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of our pipeline on self-collected real-world objects, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art CAD-model-free approaches, with better accuracy and robustness to mild occlusions.

Our approach combines keypoint-based method with learnable pose regression through `keypoint-graph', which is a graph representation of the keypoints. KGpose first estimates 3D keypoints for each object using an attentional multi-modal feature fusion of RGB and point cloud features. These keypoints are estimated from each point of point cloud and converted into a graph representation. The network directly regresses 6D pose parameters for each point through a sequence of keypoint-graph embedding and local graph embedding which are designed with graph convolutions, followed by rotation and translation heads. The final pose for each object is selected from the candidates of point-wise predictions. The method achieves competitive results on the benchmark dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. KGpose enables multi-object pose estimation without requiring an extra localization step, offering a unified and efficient solution for understanding geometric contexts in complex scenes for robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

We use the textual prompt to identify the unseen object in the scenes and then obtain high-resolution multi-scale features. These features are used to extract cross-scene matches for registration. We evaluate our model on a benchmark with a large variety of unseen objects across four datasets, namely REAL275, Toyota-Light, Linemod, and YCB-Video.

In contrast to existing approaches, in our setting (i) the object of interest is specified solely through the textual prompt, (ii) no object model (e.g., CAD or video sequence) is required at inference, and (iii) the object is imaged from two RGBD viewpoints of different scenes. To operate in this setting, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model to segment the object of interest from the scenes and to estimate its relative 6D pose. The key of our approach is a carefully devised strategy to fuse object-level information provided by the prompt with local image features, resulting in a feature space that can generalize to novel concepts. We validate our approach on a new benchmark based on two popular datasets, REAL275 and Toyota-Light, which collectively encompass 34 object instances appearing in four thousand image pairs. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both a well-established hand-crafted method and a recent deep learning-based baseline in estimating the relative 6D pose of objects in different scenes.

We train a Diffusion Model to bridge this gap using a relatively small dataset of real-world images randomly collected from unlabeled everyday objects via the DIGIT sensor. Subsequently, we employ a simulator to generate images by uniformly sampling the surface of objects from the YCB Model Set. These simulated images are then translated into the real domain using the Diffusion Model and automatically labeled to train a classifier. During this training, we further align features of the two domains using an adversarial procedure. Our evaluation is conducted on a dataset of tactile images obtained from a set of ten 3D printed YCB objects. The results reveal a total accuracy of 81.9%, a significant improvement compared to the 34.7% achieved by the classifier trained solely on simulated images. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Learning based approaches typically require training data from a highly accurate CAD model or labeled training data acquired using a complex setup. We address this by learning to estimate pose from weakly labeled data without a known CAD model. We propose to use a NeRF to learn object shape implicitly which is later used to learn view-invariant features in conjunction with CNN using a contrastive loss. While NeRF helps in learning features that are view-consistent, CNN ensures that the learned features respect symmetry. During inference, CNN is used to predict view-invariant features which can be used to establish correspondences with the implicit 3d model in NeRF. The correspondences are then used to estimate the pose in the reference frame of NeRF. Our approach can also handle symmetric objects unlike other approaches using a similar training setup. Specifically, we learn viewpoint invariant, discriminative features using NeRF which are later used for pose estimation. We evaluated our approach on LM, LM-Occlusion, and T-Less dataset and achieved benchmark accuracy despite using weakly labeled data.</p></details> | 3DV 2024 |

This scarcity impedes comprehensive evaluation of model performance, limiting research advancements. Furthermore, the restricted number of available instances or categories curtails its applications. To address these issues, this paper introduces Omni6DPose, a substantial dataset characterized by its diversity in object categories, large scale, and variety in object materials. Omni6DPose is divided into three main components: ROPE (Real 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), which includes 332K images annotated with over 1.5M annotations across 581 instances in 149 categories; SOPE(Simulated 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), consisting of 475K images created in a mixed reality setting with depth simulation, annotated with over 5M annotations across 4162 instances in the same 149 categories; and the manually aligned real scanned objects used in both ROPE and SOPE. Omni6DPose is inherently challenging due to the substantial variations and ambiguities. To address this challenge, we introduce GenPose++, an enhanced version of the SOTA category-level pose estimation framework, incorporating two pivotal improvements: Semantic-aware feature extraction and Clustering-based aggregation. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive benchmarking analysis to evaluate the performance of previous methods on this large-scale dataset in the realms of 6D object pose estimation and pose tracking.</p></details> |  |

Given challenges like rust, high reflectivity, and absent textures, this paper introduces a point cloud based pose estimation framework (PS6D). PS6D centers on slender and multi-symmetric objects. It extracts multi-scale features through an attention-guided feature extraction module, designs a symmetry-aware rotation loss and a center distance sensitive translation loss to regress the pose of each point to the centroid of the instance, and then uses a two-stage clustering method to complete instance segmentation and pose estimation. Objects from the Sil\'eane and IPA datasets and typical workpieces from industrial practice are used to generate data and evaluate the algorithm. In comparison to the state-of-the-art approach, PS6D demonstrates an 11.5\% improvement in F$_{1_{inst}}$ and a 14.8\% improvement in Recall. The main part of PS6D has been deployed to the software of Mech-Mind, and achieves a 91.7\% success rate in bin-picking experiments, marking its application in industrial pose estimation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Domain randomization hereby plays an important role in reducing the simulation to reality gap. However, this generalization might not be effective in specialized domains like a production environment involving complex assemblies. Either the individual parts, trained with synthetic images, are integrated in much larger assemblies making them indistinguishable from their counterparts and result in false positives or are partially occluded just enough to give rise to false negatives. Domain knowledge is vital in these cases and if conceived effectively while generating synthetic data, can show a considerable improvement in bridging the simulation to reality gap. This paper focuses on synthetic data generation procedures for parts and assemblies used in a production environment. The basic procedures for synthetic data generation and their various combinations are evaluated and compared on images captured in a production environment, where results show up to 15% improvement using combinations of basic procedures. Reducing the simulation to reality gap in this way can aid to utilize the true potential of robot assisted production using artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, LaTeX; typos corrected; has not been presented in any conference or published in journal</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose MatchU, a Fuse-Describe-Match strategy for 6D pose estimation from RGB-D images. MatchU is a generic approach that fuses 2D texture and 3D geometric cues for 6D pose prediction of unseen objects. We rely on learning geometric 3D descriptors that are rotation-invariant by design. By encoding pose-agnostic geometry, the learned descriptors naturally generalize to unseen objects and capture symmetries. To tackle ambiguous associations using 3D geometry only, we fuse additional RGB information into our descriptor. This is achieved through a novel attention-based mechanism that fuses cross-modal information, together with a matching loss that leverages the latent space learned from RGB data to guide the descriptor learning process. Extensive experiments reveal the generalizability of both the RGB-D fusion strategy as well as the descriptor efficacy. Benefiting from the novel designs, MatchU surpasses all existing methods by a significant margin in terms of both accuracy and speed, even without the requirement of expensive re-training or rendering.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, in high risk scenarios such as human-robot interaction, industrial inspection, and automation, reliable pose estimates are crucial. In the last years, increasingly accurate and robust deep-learning-based approaches for 6D object pose estimation have been proposed. Many top-performing methods are not end-to-end trainable but consist of multiple stages. In the context of deep uncertainty quantification, deep ensembles are considered as state of the art since they have been proven to produce well-calibrated and robust uncertainty estimates. However, deep ensembles can only be applied to methods that can be trained end-to-end. In this work, we propose a method to quantify the uncertainty of multi-stage 6D object pose estimation approaches with deep ensembles. For the implementation, we choose SurfEmb as representative, since it is one of the top-performing 6D object pose estimation approaches in the BOP Challenge 2022. We apply established metrics and concepts for deep uncertainty quantification to evaluate the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel uncertainty calibration score for regression tasks to quantify the quality of the estimated uncertainty.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In this area, dense correspondence-based methods have achieved leading performance. However, they do not explicitly consider the local and global geometric information of different instances, resulting in poor generalization ability to unseen instances with significant shape variations. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel Instance-Adaptive and Geometric-Aware Keypoint Learning method for category-level 6D object pose estimation (AG-Pose), which includes two key designs: (1) The first design is an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Detection module, which can adaptively detect a set of sparse keypoints for various instances to represent their geometric structures. (2) The second design is a Geometric-Aware Feature Aggregation module, which can efficiently integrate the local and global geometric information into keypoint features. These two modules can work together to establish robust keypoint-level correspondences for unseen instances, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the model.Experimental results on CAMERA25 and REAL275 datasets show that the proposed AG-Pose outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin without category-specific shape priors.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

Our approach can be instantly applied at test-time to a novel object without fine-tuning, as long as its CAD model is given, or a small number of reference images are captured. We bridge the gap between these two setups with a neural implicit representation that allows for effective novel view synthesis, keeping the downstream pose estimation modules invariant under the same unified framework. Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation. Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin. In addition, it even achieves comparable results to instance-level methods despite the reduced assumptions. Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown appealing performance in generating high-quality images from random noise with high indeterminacy through step-by-step denoising. Inspired by their denoising capability, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework (6D-Diff) to handle the noise and indeterminacy in object pose estimation for better performance. In our framework, to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondence, we formulate 2D keypoints detection as a reverse diffusion (denoising) process. To facilitate such a denoising process, we design a Mixture-of-Cauchy-based forward diffusion process and condition the reverse process on the object features. Extensive experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 CAMERA-READY</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose HOIDiffusion for generating realistic and diverse 3D hand-object interaction data. Our model is a conditional diffusion model that takes both the 3D hand-object geometric structure and text description as inputs for image synthesis. This offers a more controllable and realistic synthesis as we can specify the structure and style inputs in a disentangled manner. HOIDiffusion is trained by leveraging a diffusion model pre-trained on large-scale natural images and a few 3D human demonstrations.

Specifically, previous methods for novel objects do not make good use of the target object's 3D shape information since they focus on generalization by processing the shape indirectly, making them less effective. We present GenFlow, an approach that enables both accuracy and generalization to novel objects with the guidance of the target object's shape. Our method predicts optical flow between the rendered image and the observed image and refines the 6D pose iteratively. It boosts the performance by a constraint of the 3D shape and the generalizable geometric knowledge learned from an end-to-end differentiable system. We further improve our model by designing a cascade network architecture to exploit the multi-scale correlations and coarse-to-fine refinement. GenFlow ranked first on the unseen object pose estimation benchmarks in both the RGB and RGB-D cases. It also achieves performance competitive with existing state-of-the-art methods for the seen object pose estimation without any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Uncertain pose estimates can lead to task failures; however, a certain degree of error in the pose estimates is often acceptable. Hence, by quantifying errors in the object pose estimate and acceptable errors for task success, robots can make informed decisions. This is a challenging problem as both the object pose uncertainty and acceptable error for the robotic task are often multi-modal and cannot be parameterized with commonly used uni-modal distributions. In this paper, we introduce a framework for evaluating robotic task success under object pose uncertainty, representing both the estimated error space of the object pose and the acceptable error space for task success using multi-modal non-parametric probability distributions. The proposed framework pre-computes the acceptable error space for task success using dynamic simulations and subsequently integrates the pre-computed acceptable error space over the estimated error space of the object pose to predict the likelihood of the task success. We evaluated the proposed framework on two mobile manipulation tasks. Our results show that by representing the estimated and the acceptable error space using multi-modal non-parametric distributions, we achieve higher task success rates and fewer failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

GigaPose first leverages discriminative "templates", rendered images of the CAD models, to recover the out-of-plane rotation and then uses patch correspondences to estimate the four remaining parameters. Our approach samples templates in only a two-degrees-of-freedom space instead of the usual three and matches the input image to the templates using fast nearest-neighbor search in feature space, results in a speedup factor of 35x compared to the state of the art. Moreover, GigaPose is significantly more robust to segmentation errors. Our extensive evaluation on the seven core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated with existing refinement methods. Additionally, we show the potential of GigaPose with 3D models predicted by recent work on 3D reconstruction from a single image, relaxing the need for CAD models and making 6D pose object estimation much more convenient.

Despite the impressive progress enabled by deep learning, single-view RGB pose estimation models perform poorly in cluttered dynamic environments. Imbuing the rich temporal information contained in the video of scenes has the potential to enhance models ability to deal with the adverse effects of occlusion and the dynamic nature of the environments. Moreover, joint object detection and pose estimation models are better suited to leverage the co-dependent nature of the tasks for improving the accuracy of both tasks. To this end, we propose attention-based temporal fusion for multi-object 6D pose estimation that accumulates information across multiple frames of a video sequence. Our MOTPose method takes a sequence of images as input and performs joint object detection and pose estimation for all objects in one forward pass. It learns to aggregate both object embeddings and object parameters over multiple time steps using cross-attention-based fusion modules. We evaluate our method on the physically-realistic cluttered bin-picking dataset SynPick and the YCB-Video dataset and demonstrate improved pose estimation accuracy as well as better object detection accuracy</p></details> |  |

Fortunately, the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has showcased remarkable zero-shot transfer performance, which provides a promising solution to tackle this task. Motivated by this, we introduce SAM-6D, a novel framework designed to realize the task through two steps, including instance segmentation and pose estimation. Given the target objects, SAM-6D employs two dedicated sub-networks, namely Instance Segmentation Model (ISM) and Pose Estimation Model (PEM), to perform these steps on cluttered RGB-D images. ISM takes SAM as an advanced starting point to generate all possible object proposals and selectively preserves valid ones through meticulously crafted object matching scores in terms of semantics, appearance and geometry. By treating pose estimation as a partial-to-partial point matching problem, PEM performs a two-stage point matching process featuring a novel design of background tokens to construct dense 3D-3D correspondence, ultimately yielding the pose estimates. Without bells and whistles, SAM-6D outperforms the existing methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark for both instance segmentation and pose estimation of novel objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2024.

Current methods for scene understanding typically rely on a combination of trained models paired with either an explicit or learnt volumetric representation, all of which have their own drawbacks and limitations. We introduce DreamUp3D, a novel Object-Centric Generative Model (OCGM) designed explicitly to perform inference on a 3D scene informed only by a single RGB-D image. DreamUp3D is a self-supervised model, trained end-to-end, and is capable of segmenting objects, providing 3D object reconstructions, generating object-centric latent representations and accurate per-object 6D pose estimates. We compare DreamUp3D to baselines including NeRFs, pre-trained CLIP-features, ObSurf, and ObPose, in a range of tasks including 3D scene reconstruction, object matching and object pose estimation. Our experiments show that our model outperforms all baselines by a significant margin in real-world scenarios displaying its applicability for 3D scene understanding tasks while meeting the strict demands exhibited in robotics applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Sketch2PoseNet: Efficient and Generalized Sketch to 3D Human Pose Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26196v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 |
| **[PRGCN: A Graph Memory Network for Cross-Sequence Pattern Reuse in 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19475v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network (PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

As an important component of Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics: MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset, where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.</p></details> |  |

A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano.

Both categories of datasets exhibit inadequacies in furnishing adequate human identities and authentic in-the-wild background scenes, which are crucial for accurately simulating real-world distributions. In this work, we show that synthetic data created by generative models is complementary to CG-rendered data for achieving remarkable generalization performance on diverse real-world scenes. We propose an effective data generation pipeline based on recent diffusion models, termed HumanWild, which can effortlessly generate human images and corresponding 3D mesh annotations. Specifically, we first collect a large-scale human-centric dataset with comprehensive annotations, e.g, text captions, the depth map, and surface normal images. To generate a wide variety of human images with initial labels, we train a customized, multi-condition ControlNet model. The key to this process is using a 3D parametric model, e.g, SMPL-X, to create various condition inputs easily. Our data generation pipeline is both flexible and customizable, making it adaptable to multiple real-world tasks, such as human interaction in complex scenes and humans captured by wide-angle lenses. By relying solely on generative models, we can produce large-scale, in-the-wild human images with high-quality annotations, significantly reducing the need for manual image collection and annotation. The generated dataset encompasses a wide range of viewpoints, environments, and human identities, ensuring its versatility across different scenarios. We hope that our work could pave the way for scaling up 3D human recovery to in-the-wild scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI, project page: https://yongtaoge.github.io/projects/humanwild</p></details> |

State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large, non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27 hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models. Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCVW 2025</p></details> |

Current state-of-the-art methods typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity; however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE. Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better computational trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Differentially Private 2D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10190v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation (HPE) has become essential in numerous applications including healthcare, activity recognition, and human-computer interaction. However, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present significant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional anonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data utility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal privacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied naively. In this work, we present the first comprehensive framework for differentially private 2D human pose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance, we adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace. Next, we incorporate Feature Differential Privacy(FDP) to selectively privatize only sensitive features while retaining public visual cues. Finally, we propose a hybrid feature-projective DP framework that combines both approaches to balance privacy and accuracy for HPE. We evaluate our approach on the MPII dataset across varying privacy budgets, training strategies, and clipping norms. Our combined feature-projective method consistently outperforms vanilla DP-SGD and individual baselines, achieving up to 82.61\% mean PCKh@0.5 at $\epsilon = 0.8$, substantially closing the gap to the non-private performance. This work lays foundation for privacy-preserving human pose estimation in real-world, sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |

A finger-pointing gesture conveys vital information regarding some point of interest in the environment. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), users can easily direct robots to target locations, facilitating tasks in diverse domains such as search and rescue or factory assistance. State-of-the-art approaches for visual pointing estimation often rely on depth cameras, are limited to indoor environments, and provide discrete predictions between limited targets. In this paper, we explore the development of models that enable robots to understand pointing directives from humans using a single web camera, even in diverse indoor and outdoor environments. A novel perception framework is proposed which includes a designated data-based model termed PointingNet. PointingNet recognizes the occurrence of pointing through classification followed by approximating the position and direction of the index finger with an advanced regression model. The model relies on a novel segmentation model for masking any lifted arm. While state-of-the-art human pose estimation models provide poor pointing angle estimation error of 28deg, PointingNet exhibits a mean error of less than 2deg. With the pointing information, the target location is computed, followed by robot motion planning and execution. The framework is evaluated on two robotic systems, demonstrating accurate target reaching.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this, we propose Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization) without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The code is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/ajiaaa/ARSAM.</p></details> |  |

Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks (MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17 keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg \pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$) and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision.

Past work has shown promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors. Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users, primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains the sparse on-body measurements.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study the vulnerability of HPE systems to disappearance attacks, where the attacker aims to subtly alter the HPE training process via backdoor techniques so that any input image with some specific trigger will not be recognized as involving any human pose. As humans are typically at the center of HPE systems, a successful attack will severely threaten pedestrians' lives if a self-driving car incorrectly understands the front scene. To achieve the adversarial goal of disappearance, we propose \emph{IntC}, a general framework to craft an invisibility cloak in the HPE domain. By designing target HPE labels that do not represent any human pose, we propose three specific backdoor attacks based on our IntC framework. IntC-S and IntC-E, respectively designed for regression- and heatmap-based HPE techniques, concentrate the keypoints of triggered images in a tiny, imperceptible region. Further, to improve the attack's stealthiness, IntC-L designs the target poisons to capture the label outputs of typical landscape images without a human involved, achieving disappearance and reducing detectability simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our IntC methods in achieving the disappearance goal. By revealing the vulnerability of HPE to disappearance and backdoor attacks, we hope our work can raise awareness of the potential risks when HPE models are deployed in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the first attempt to estimate 3D human body mesh from sparse LiDAR point clouds. We found that the major challenge in estimating human pose and mesh from point clouds lies in the sparsity, noise, and incompletion of LiDAR point clouds. Facing these challenges, we propose an effective sparse-to-dense reconstruction scheme to reconstruct 3D human mesh. This involves estimating a sparse representation of a human (3D human pose) and gradually reconstructing the body mesh. To better leverage the 3D structural information of point clouds, we employ a cascaded graph transformer (graphormer) to introduce point cloud features during sparse-to-dense reconstruction. Experimental results on three publicly available databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

| **[Physics-Informed Learning for Human Whole-Body Kinematics Prediction via Sparse IMUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25704v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements. During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy, smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects</p></details> |  |
| **[SDPose: Exploiting Diffusion Priors for Out-of-Domain and Robust Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24980v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization, their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD. Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Generative Modeling of Shape-Dependent Self-Contact Human Poses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23393v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving single-view pose estimation in self-contact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations. This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods. Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | Accept at PRCV 2025 |
| **[Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20611v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods for 3D human pose estimation face significant computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of self-attention mechanism complexity with sequence length. Recently, the Mamba model has substantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding performance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM). However, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3D joint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution structure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To address these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in this paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction and length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing effective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint sequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba model by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling it to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a Spatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial relationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal topology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing human structural relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets for testing and comparison, and the results show that the proposed method greatly reduces computational cost while achieving higher accuracy. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose Prior Learner: Unsupervised Categorical Prior Learning for Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03858v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prior represents a set of beliefs or assumptions about a system, aiding inference and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce the challenge of unsupervised categorical prior learning in pose estimation, where AI models learn a general pose prior for an object category from images in a self-supervised manner. Although priors are effective in estimating pose, acquiring them can be difficult. We propose a novel method, named Pose Prior Learner (PPL), to learn a general pose prior for any object category. PPL uses a hierarchical memory to store compositional parts of prototypical poses, from which we distill a general pose prior. This prior improves pose estimation accuracy through template transformation and image reconstruction. PPL learns meaningful pose priors without any additional human annotations or interventions, outperforming competitive baselines on both human and animal pose estimation datasets. Notably, our experimental results reveal the effectiveness of PPL using learned prototypical poses for pose estimation on occluded images. Through iterative inference, PPL leverages the pose prior to refine estimated poses, regressing them to any prototypical poses stored in memory. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Among these factors, camera viewpoints and locations have been shown to contribute significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained model.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology</p></details> |

Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on free-living home settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.</p></details> |  |

As a result, methods that achieve near-optimal in-dataset accuracy often degrade on unseen datasets. In practice, however, systems must adapt to diverse viewpoints, environments, and camera setups--conditions that differ significantly from those encountered during training, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. Measuring cross-dataset performance is a vital process, but extremely labor-intensive when done manually for human pose estimation. To address these challenges, we automate this evaluation using PoseBench3D, a standardized testing framework that enables consistent and fair cross-dataset comparisons on previously unseen data. PoseBench3D streamlines testing across four widely used 3D HPE datasets via a single, configurable interface. Using this framework, we re-evaluate 18 methods and report over 100 cross-dataset results under Protocol 1: MPJPE and Protocol 2: PA-MPJPE, revealing systematic generalization gaps and the impact of common preprocessing and dataset setup choices.

In this paper, we introduce a novel video clipping strategy to extract frames of each player's racket swing in a badminton broadcast match. These clipped frames are then processed by three existing models: one for Human Pose Estimation to obtain human skeletal joints, another for shuttlecock trajectory tracking, and the other for court line detection to determine player positions on the court. Leveraging these data as inputs, we propose Badminton Stroke-type Transformer (BST) to classify player stroke-types in singles. To the best of our knowledge, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the largest publicly available badminton video dataset (ShuttleSet), another badminton dataset (BadmintonDB), and a tennis dataset (TenniSet). These results suggest that effectively leveraging ball trajectory is a promising direction for action recognition in racket sports.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main paper, 2 pages references, 8 pages supplementary material</p></details> |

In-context learning (ICL) is a promising framework for achieving this goal due to its test-time data efficiency and rapid adaptability. However, current ICL methods rely on labor-intensive teleoperated data for training, which restricts scalability. We propose using human play videos -- continuous, unlabeled videos of people interacting freely with their environment -- as a scalable and diverse training data source. We introduce MimicDroid, which enables humanoids to perform ICL using human play videos as the only training data. MimicDroid extracts trajectory pairs with similar manipulation behaviors and trains the policy to predict the actions of one trajectory conditioned on the other. Through this process, the model acquired ICL capabilities for adapting to novel objects and environments at test time. To bridge the embodiment gap, MimicDroid first retargets human wrist poses estimated from RGB videos to the humanoid, leveraging kinematic similarity. It also applies random patch masking during training to reduce overfitting to human-specific cues and improve robustness to visual differences. To evaluate few-shot learning for humanoids, we introduce an open-source simulation benchmark with increasing levels of generalization difficulty. MimicDroid outperformed state-of-the-art methods and achieved nearly twofold higher success rates in the real world.

There is rapid development of human pose estimation methods in computer vision thanks to advances in deep learning and machine learning. However, these methods are trained on datasets that feature adults in different contexts. This work tests and compares seven popular methods (AlphaPose, DeepLabCut/DeeperCut, Detectron2, HRNet, MediaPipe/BlazePose, OpenPose, and ViTPose) on videos of infants in supine position and in more complex settings. Surprisingly, all methods except DeepLabCut and MediaPipe have competitive performance without additional finetuning, with ViTPose performing best. Next to standard performance metrics (average precision and recall), we introduce errors expressed in the neck-mid-hip (torso length) ratio and additionally study missed and redundant detections, and the reliability of the internal confidence ratings of the different methods, which are relevant for downstream tasks. Among the networks with competitive performance, only AlphaPose could run close to real time (27 fps) on our machine.

Notably, language offers rich HPE priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module (GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage, modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation datasets. We will release the code soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[H$_{2}$OT: Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Video Pose Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06956v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module (TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

However, existing body models have simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses. We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code, and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Aware ViT-based Framework for Monocular 6-DoF Spacecraft Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06000v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers 6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Human-Level 3D Relative Pose Estimation: Generalizable, Training-Free, with Single Reference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18453v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can easily deduce the relative pose of a previously unseen object, without labeling or training, given only a single query-reference image pair. This is arguably achieved by incorporating i) 3D/2.5D shape perception from a single image, ii) render-and-compare simulation, and iii) rich semantic cue awareness to furnish (coarse) reference-query correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D generalizable relative pose estimation method by elaborating 3D/2.5D shape perception with a 2.5D shape from an RGB-D reference, fulfilling the render-and-compare paradigm with an off-the-shelf differentiable renderer, and leveraging the semantic cues from a pretrained model like DINOv2. Specifically, our differentiable renderer takes the 2.5D rotatable mesh textured by the RGB and the semantic maps (obtained by DINOv2 from the RGB input), then renders new RGB and semantic maps (with back-surface culling) under a novel rotated view. The refinement loss comes from comparing the rendered RGB and semantic maps with the query ones, back-propagating the gradients through the differentiable renderer to refine the 3D relative pose. As a result, \emph{our method can be readily applied to unseen objects, given only a single RGB-D reference, without labeling or training}. Extensive experiments on LineMOD, LM-O, and YCB-V show that our training-free method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised methods, especially under the rigorous \texttt{Acc@5/10/15}$^\circ$ metrics and the challenging cross-dataset settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE TPAMI.

| **[An End-to-End Framework for Video Multi-Person Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01095v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation. Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and improves inference efficiency by 300%.</p></details> |  |
| **[MV-SSM: Multi-View State Space Modeling for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00649v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging, particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning (GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP (+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations.

| **[Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation with Hierarchical Temporal Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21363v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1) Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[PersPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation with Perspective Encoding and Perspective Rotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17239v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding (PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly, which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject, thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework, PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach.

| **[Bring Your Rear Cameras for Egocentric 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11652v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric 3D human pose estimation has been actively studied using cameras installed in front of a head-mounted device (HMD). While frontal placement is the optimal and the only option for some tasks, such as hand tracking, it remains unclear if the same holds for full-body tracking due to self-occlusion and limited field-of-view coverage. Notably, even the state-of-the-art methods often fail to estimate accurate 3D poses in many scenarios, such as when HMD users tilt their heads upward -- a common motion in human activities. A key limitation of existing HMD designs is their neglect of the back of the body, despite its potential to provide crucial 3D reconstruction cues. Hence, this paper investigates the usefulness of rear cameras for full-body tracking. We also show that simply adding rear views to the frontal inputs is not optimal for existing methods due to their dependence on individual 2D joint detectors without effective multi-view integration. To address this issue, we propose a new transformer-based method that refines 2D joint heatmap estimation with multi-view information and heatmap uncertainty, thereby improving 3D pose tracking. Also, we introduce two new large-scale datasets, Ego4View-Syn and Ego4View-RW, for a rear-view evaluation. Our experiments show that the new camera configurations with back views provide superior support for 3D pose tracking compared to only frontal placements. The proposed method achieves significant improvement over the current state of the art (>10% on MPJPE).

This scenario poses a challenge in extracting and leveraging multi-scale features, which is often essential for precise inference. To address this challenge, we propose a new attention mechanism, named cascaded multi-scale attention (CMSA), tailored for use in CNN-ViT hybrid architectures, to handle low-resolution inputs effectively. The design of CMSA enables the extraction and seamless integration of features across various scales without necessitating the downsampling of the input image or feature maps. This is achieved through a novel combination of grouped multi-head self-attention mechanisms with window-based local attention and cascaded fusion of multi-scale features over different scales. This architecture allows for the effective handling of features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to perform tasks such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more with low-resolution images. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in these areas with fewer parameters, showcasing its potential for broad application in real-world scenarios where capturing high-resolution images is not feasible.

The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available, and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed, the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE-RAS 24th International Conference on Humanoid Robots, Sep 2025, Seoul (Korea), South Korea</p></details> |
| **[HyperDiff: Hypergraph Guided Diffusion Model for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14431v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process. Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty, alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learnable SMPLify: A Neural Solution for Optimization-Free Human Pose Inverse Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13562v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space. Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify, generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/Learnable-SMPLify.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refinement Module based on Parse Graph for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11069v7)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parse graphs have been widely used in human pose estimation (HPE) to model the hierarchical structure and context relations of the human body, which has been shown to effectively improve robustness and accuracy. But most methods rely on parse graphs built from predefined skeletons, causing two key issues: poor integratability with other models, and complex designs with redundant parameters for hierarchy and context relation modeling of body. To address these issues, we propose a novel Refinement Module based on Parse Graph (RMPG). RMPG abandons skeleton connections and refines features by building implicit hierarchical structures and context relations between sub-feature maps, with strong integratability. Furthermore, our hierarchical network design demonstrates that RMPG can model the body's hierarchical structure and context relations with a simpler architecture and fewer parameters. RMPG operates in two stages: the top-down decomposition recursively partitions the feature map into a tree-structured hierarchy, where each node corresponds to a sub-feature map; the bottom-up composition aggregates context information to progressively refine the feature representation. Extensive experiments show that RMPG can be flexibly embedded into various methods, including our hierarchical networks, and consistently improves performance across multiple mainstream HPE benchmarks. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable Diffusion-Based Approach for Human De-Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12663v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can infer the missing parts of an occluded object by leveraging prior knowledge and visible cues. However, enabling deep learning models to accurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task. De-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions. The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as 2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | MM 2025 |

To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly improves generalization performance without requiring additional data collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models (e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures. Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$, while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under review</p></details> |
| **[A Coarse-to-Fine Human Pose Estimation Method based on Two-stage Distillation and Progressive Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11212v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation. However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model. The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is more significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient High-Resolution Visual Representation Learning with State Space Model for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03174v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing long-range dependencies while preserving high-resolution visual representations is crucial for dense prediction tasks such as human pose estimation. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced global modeling through self-attention but suffer from quadratic computational complexity with respect to token count, limiting their efficiency and scalability to high-resolution inputs, especially on mobile and resource-constrained devices. State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, offer an efficient alternative by combining global receptive fields with linear computational complexity, enabling scalable and resource-friendly sequence modeling. However, when applied to dense prediction tasks, existing visual SSMs face key limitations: weak spatial inductive bias, long-range forgetting from hidden state decay, and low-resolution outputs that hinder fine-grained localization. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Visual State Space (DVSS) block, which augments visual state space models with multi-scale convolutional operations to enhance local spatial representations and strengthen spatial inductive biases. Through architectural exploration and theoretical analysis, we incorporate deformable operation into the DVSS block, identifying it as an efficient and effective mechanism to enhance semantic aggregation and mitigate long-range forgetting via input-dependent, adaptive spatial sampling. We embed DVSS into a multi-branch high-resolution architecture to build HRVMamba, a novel model for efficient high-resolution representation learning. Extensive experiments on human pose estimation, image classification, and semantic segmentation show that HRVMamba performs competitively against leading CNN-, ViT-, and SSM-based baselines.

Mamba, a recent sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$ fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and 2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area, 9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ESWEEK 2025 (CODES+ISSS) conference</p></details> |

However, mmWave radar relies on the collection of reflected signals from the target, and the radar signals containing information is difficult to be fully applied. This has been a long-standing hindrance to the improvement of pose estimation accuracy. To address this major challenge, this paper introduces a probability map guided multi-format feature fusion model, ProbRadarM3F. This is a novel radar feature extraction framework using a traditional FFT method in parallel with a probability map based positional encoding method. ProbRadarM3F fuses the traditional heatmap features and the positional features, then effectively achieves the estimation of 14 keypoints of the human body. Experimental evaluation on the HuPR dataset proves the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper, outperforming other methods experimented on this dataset with an AP of 69.9 %. The emphasis of our study is focusing on the position information that is not exploited before in radar singal. This provides direction to investigate other potential non-redundant information from mmWave rader.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present Garment Inertial Poser (GaIP), a method for estimating full-body poses from sparse and loosely attached IMU sensors. We first simulate IMU recordings using an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. Our transformer-based diffusion models synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses from this challenging loose IMU data. We also demonstrate that incorporating garment-related parameters during training on loose IMU data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Our experiments show that our diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperform state-of-the-art inertial full-body pose estimators, both quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research on motion capture from such realistic sensor placements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

This feature extractor is able to model inter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The extracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical constraints.

Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.</p></details> | 13pages,2figures |

Compared to traditional methods based on Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

| **[VOccl3D: A Video Benchmark Dataset for 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation under real Occlusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06757v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied, with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g., most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques, incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions, offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets.

We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26 three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals, with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021. As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification, resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.</p></details> |  |

We develop the complete pipeline for a single vision sensor based multi-pedestrian detection and tracking, pose estimation, and monocular depth perception. Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance, even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements, including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7% improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware and inclusive robot behaviour.</p></details> |  |
| **[BaroPoser: Real-time Human Motion Tracking from IMUs and Barometers in Everyday Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03313v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |

Additionally, innovative breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1) Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2) Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation technology.</p></details> | 10 pages, 20 figures |
| **[IMUCoCo: Enabling Flexible On-Body IMU Placement for Human Pose Estimation and Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01894v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IMUs are regularly used to sense human motion, recognize activities, and estimate full-body pose. Users are typically required to place sensors in predefined locations that are often dictated by common wearable form factors and the machine learning model's training process. Consequently, despite the increasing number of everyday devices equipped with IMUs, the limited adaptability has seriously constrained the user experience to only using a few well-explored device placements (e.g., wrist and ears). In this paper, we rethink IMU-based motion sensing by acknowledging that signals can be captured from any point on the human body. We introduce IMU over Continuous Coordinates (IMUCoCo), a novel framework that maps signals from a variable number of IMUs placed on the body surface into a unified feature space based on their spatial coordinates. These features can be plugged into downstream models for pose estimation and activity recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that IMUCoCo supports accurate pose estimation in a wide range of typical and atypical sensor placements. Overall, IMUCoCo supports significantly more flexible use of IMUs for motion sensing than the state-of-the-art, allowing users to place their sensors-laden devices according to their needs and preferences. The framework also supports the ability to change device locations depending on the context and suggests placement depending on the use case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection, Pose Estimation and Segmentation for Multiple Bodies: Closing the Virtuous Circle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01562v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation methods work well on isolated people but struggle with multiple-bodies-in-proximity scenarios. Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models.

| **[Mitigating Resolution-Drift in Federated Learning: Case of Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23461v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks. However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs (teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks that rely on preserving spatial detail.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Sharp to Blur: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for 2D Human Pose Estimation Under Extreme Motion Blur Using Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22438v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation, sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation, we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations. Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain adaptation in real-world motion blur environments. Our project codes are available at https://github.com/kmax2001/EvSharp2Blur.</p></details> |  |
| **[KASportsFormer: Kinematic Anatomy Enhanced Transformer for 3D Human Pose Estimation on Short Sports Scene Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20763v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts. Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser (LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/jw0r1n/KASportsFormer</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Testing-Time Optimization for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02339v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although data-driven methods have achieved success in 3D human pose estimation, they often suffer from domain gaps and exhibit limited generalization. In contrast, optimization-based methods excel in fine-tuning for specific cases but are generally inferior to data-driven methods in overall performance. We observe that previous optimization-based methods commonly rely on a projection constraint, which only ensures alignment in 2D space, potentially leading to the overfitting problem. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware testing-time Optimization (UAO) framework, which keeps the prior information of the pre-trained model and alleviates the overfitting problem using the uncertainty of joints. Specifically, during the training phase, we design an effective 2D-to-3D network for estimating the corresponding 3D pose while quantifying the uncertainty of each 3D joint. For optimization during testing, the proposed optimization framework freezes the pre-trained model and optimizes only a latent state. Projection loss is then employed to ensure the generated poses are well aligned in 2D space for high-quality optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the uncertainty of each joint to determine how much each joint is allowed for optimization. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework are validated through extensive experiments on challenging datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. Notably, our approach outperforms the previous best result by a large margin of 5.5\% on Human3.6M.

| **[A Structure-aware and Motion-adaptive Framework for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19852v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically, SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

Since calibrating multiple cameras and finding matches across their views are inherently interdependent, performing both in a unified framework poses a significant challenge. We address these issues as a single registration problem of matching two sets of 3D points, leveraging human motion in dynamic multi-person scenes. To this end, we utilize 3D human poses obtained from an off-the-shelf monocular 3D human pose estimator and transform them into 3D points on a unit sphere, to solve the rotation, time offset, and the association alternatingly. We employ a probabilistic approach that can jointly solve both problems of aligning spatiotemporal data and establishing correspondences through soft assignment between two views. The translation is determined by applying coplanarity constraints. The pairwise registration results are integrated into a multiview setup, and then a nonlinear optimization method is used to improve the accuracy of the camera poses, temporal offsets, and multi-person associations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method as a practical marker-free calibration tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Physics-based Human Pose Estimation from a Single Moving RGB Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17406v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods, while achieving state-of-the-art results, suffer from artifacts when the scene does not have a strictly flat ground plane or when the camera is moving. Moreover, these methods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without ground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry changes. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first non-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a dynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion with human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a physics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints for more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat scenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to obtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera trajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then refine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer. From our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle with this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar environments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses in world coordinates.</p></details> |  |

This ''data gap'' is a key challenge both for building intelligent artificial systems and for understanding human development. Egocentric video capturing children's experience--their ''training data''--is a key ingredient for comparison of humans and models and for the development of algorithmic innovations to bridge this gap. Yet there are few such datasets available, and extant data are low-resolution, have limited metadata, and importantly, represent only a small set of children's experiences. Here, we provide the first release of a large developmental egocentric video dataset--the BabyView dataset--recorded using a high-resolution camera with a large vertical field-of-view and gyroscope/accelerometer data. This 868 hour dataset includes egocentric videos from children spanning 6 months to 3 years of age in longitudinal, at-home contexts. We provide gold-standard annotations for the evaluation of speech transcription, speaker diarization, and human pose estimation, and evaluate models in each of these domains. We train self-supervised language and vision models and evaluate their transfer to out-of-distribution tasks, including syntactic structure learning, object recognition, depth estimation, and image segmentation. Although performance in each domain scales with dataset size, overall performance is relatively lower than when models are trained on curated datasets, especially in the visual domain. Our dataset stands as an open challenge for robust, human-like AI systems: how can such systems achieve human-levels of success on the same scale and distribution of training data as humans?</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables and Appendix.

While the airports are more likely to become hotspots for potential conflicts to break out which can cause serious delays to flights and several safety issues. An intelligent algorithm which renders security surveillance more effective in detecting conflicts would bring many benefits to the passengers in terms of their safety, finance, and travelling efficiency. This paper details the development of a machine learning model to classify conflicting behaviour in a crowd. HRNet is used to segment the images and then two approaches are taken to classify the poses of people in the frame via multiple classifiers. Among them, it was found that the support vector machine (SVM) achieved the most performant achieving precision of 94.37%. Where the model falls short is against ambiguous behaviour such as a hug or losing track of a subject in the frame. The resulting model has potential for deployment within an airport if improvements are made to cope with the vast number of potential passengers in view as well as training against further ambiguous behaviours which will arise in an airport setting. In turn, will provide the capability to enhance security surveillance and improve airport safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>One o...</summary><p>One of the authors has expressed privacy concerns and made a related request</p></details> |

Its place in art reflects its growing applications in industry, such as robotics. However, those interactions often remains too technical and machine-driven for people to really engage into. On the artistic side, new technologies are often not explored in their full potential and lag a bit behind, so that state-of-the-art research does not make its way up to museums and exhibitions. Machines should support people's imagination and poetry in a seamless interface to their body or soul. We propose an artistic sound installation featuring neuromorphic body sensing to support a direct yet non intrusive interaction with the visitor with the purpose of creating sound scapes together with the machine. We design a neuromorphic multihead human pose estimation neural sensor that shapes sound scapes and visual output with fine body movement control. In particular, the feature extractor is a spiking neural network tailored for a dedicated neuromorphic chip.

While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE ICRA 2025 (workshop: Enhancing Human Mobility: From Computer Vision-Based Motion Tracking to Wearable Assistive Robot Control), May 2025, Atlanta (Georgia), United States</p></details> |

Traditional methods for calisthenics skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods, achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, In International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing</p></details> |

While HAR has been extensively studied, action summarization using Wi-Fi and IMU signals in smart-home environments , which involves identifying and summarizing continuous actions, remains an emerging task. This paper introduces the novel XRF V2 dataset, designed for indoor daily activity Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and action summarization. XRF V2 integrates multimodal data from Wi-Fi signals, IMU sensors (smartphones, smartwatches, headphones, and smart glasses), and synchronized video recordings, offering a diverse collection of indoor activities from 16 volunteers across three distinct environments. To tackle TAL and action summarization, we propose the XRFMamba neural network, which excels at capturing long-term dependencies in untrimmed sensory sequences and achieves the best performance with an average mAP of 78.74, outperforming the recent WiFiTAD by 5.49 points in mAP@avg while using 35% fewer parameters. In action summarization, we introduce a new metric, Response Meaning Consistency (RMC), to evaluate action summarization performance. And it achieves an average Response Meaning Consistency (mRMC) of 0.802. We envision XRF V2 as a valuable resource for advancing research in human action localization, action forecasting, pose estimation, multimodal foundation models pre-training, synthetic data generation, and more.

Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet. Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.</p></details> |  |

Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis, due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait, to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs.

| **[PoseLLM: Enhancing Language-Guided Human Pose Estimation with MLP Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09139v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation, enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions. Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in language-guided pose estimation.

| **[AthletePose3D: A Benchmark Dataset for 3D Human Pose Estimation and Kinematic Validation in Athletic Movements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07499v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation is a critical task in computer vision and sports biomechanics, with applications spanning sports science, rehabilitation, and biomechanical research. While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%. We also validate the kinematic accuracy of monocular pose estimations through waveform analysis, highlighting strong correlations in joint angle estimations but limitations in velocity estimation. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of monocular pose estimation models in the context of sports, contributing valuable insights for advancing monocular pose estimation techniques in high-performance sports environments.

Our method integrates robust multi-view 2D pose tracking via a transformer-based top-down approach, employing epipolar geometry constraints and long-term video object segmentation for consistent identity tracking across views. Initial 3D poses are obtained through weighted triangulation and spline smoothing, followed by kinematic optimization to refine pose accuracy. We further enhance pose realism and robustness by introducing a multi-person physics-based trajectory optimization step, effectively addressing challenges such as rapid motions, occlusions, and close interactions. Experimental results on diverse datasets, including a new benchmark of elite boxing footage, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we release comprehensive annotated video datasets to advance future research in multi-person pose estimation for combat sports.</p></details> |  |
| **[mmEgoHand: Egocentric Hand Pose Estimation and Gesture Recognition with Head-mounted Millimeter-wave Radar and IMU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13805v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar have demonstrated its potential for human action recognition and pose estimation, offering privacy-preserving advantages over conventional cameras while maintaining occlusion robustness, with promising applications in human-computer interaction and wellness care. However, existing mmWave systems typically employ fixed-position configurations, restricting user mobility to predefined zones and limiting practical deployment scenarios. We introduce mmEgoHand, a head-mounted egocentric system for hand pose estimation to support applications such as gesture recognition, VR interaction, skill digitization and assessment, and robotic teleoperation. mmEgoHand synergistically integrates mmWave radar with inertial measurement units (IMUs) to enable dynamic perception. The IMUs actively compensate for radar interference induced by head movements, while our novel end-to-end Transformer architecture simultaneously estimates 3D hand keypoint coordinates through multi-modal sensor fusion. This dual-modality framework achieves spatial-temporal alignment of mmWave heatmaps with IMUs, overcoming viewpoint instability inherent in egocentric sensing scenarios. We further demonstrate that intermediate hand pose representations substantially improve performance in downstream task, e.g., VR gesture recognition. Extensive evaluations with 10 subjects performing 8 gestures across 3 distinct postures -- standing, sitting, lying -- achieve 90.8% recognition accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by a large margin.

In this paper, we propose Sparse Correlation and Joint Distillation (SCJD), a novel framework that balances efficiency and accuracy for 3D HPE. SCJD introduces Sparse Correlation Input Sequence Downsampling to reduce redundancy in student network inputs while preserving inter-frame correlations. For effective knowledge transfer, we propose Dynamic Joint Spatial Attention Distillation, which includes Dynamic Joint Embedding Distillation to enhance the student's feature representation using the teacher's multi-frame context feature, and Adjacent Joint Attention Distillation to improve the student network's focus on adjacent joint relationships for better spatial understanding. Additionally, Temporal Consistency Distillation aligns the temporal correlations between teacher and student networks through upsampling and global supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCJD achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/wileychan/SCJD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Close Human Interaction with Appearance and Proxemics Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02565v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.

Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the gait parameters of athletes.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent noise in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g., 30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation. Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts. Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted in IROS25, Hangzhou, China</p></details> |

This paper presents a test environment that combines a Vehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the feasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and vehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian localization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach through a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations of VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a commercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is generated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and projected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation technique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle perception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP domains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in movement trajectories and joint estimation stability. The validation includes dynamic test scenarios where human avatars, both walking and cycling, are monitored under controlled conditions. Our results show a strong alignment in HPE between RW and CP test conditions for stable motion patterns, while notable inaccuracies persist under dynamic movements and occlusions, particularly for complex cyclist postures. These findings contribute to refining CP testing approaches for evaluating next-generation AI-based vehicle perception and to enhancing interaction models of automated vehicles and VRUs in CP environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Preprint for 2025 IEEE IAVVC (International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference)</p></details> |
| **[Disentangled Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04444v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based methods for monocular 3D human pose estimation have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance by directly regressing the 3D joint coordinates from the 2D pose sequence. Although some methods decompose the task into bone length and bone direction prediction based on the human anatomical skeleton to explicitly incorporate more human body prior constraints, the performance of these methods is significantly lower than that of the SOTA diffusion-based methods. This can be attributed to the tree structure of the human skeleton. Direct application of the disentangled method could amplify the accumulation of hierarchical errors, propagating through each hierarchy. Meanwhile, the hierarchical information has not been fully explored by the previous methods. To address these problems, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser is proposed, termed DDHPose. In our approach: (1) We disentangle the 3D pose and diffuse the bone length and bone direction during the forward process of the diffusion model to effectively model the human pose prior. A disentanglement loss is proposed to supervise diffusion model learning. (2) For the reverse process, we propose Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser (HSTDenoiser) to improve the hierarchical modeling of each joint. Our HSTDenoiser comprises two components: the Hierarchical-Related Spatial Transformer (HRST) and the Hierarchical-Related Temporal Transformer (HRTT). HRST exploits joint spatial information and the influence of the parent joint on each joint for spatial modeling, while HRTT utilizes information from both the joint and its hierarchical adjacent joints to explore the hierarchical temporal correlations among joints.

Advancements in neural networks have significantly alleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports broadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it depends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive game analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match recordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to identify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's flying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying on human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or unavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration method capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted an existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to accurately track player movements. Together, these contributions enable the full 3D reconstruction of a table tennis rally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVSport 2025</p></details> |
| **[Systematic Comparison of Projection Methods for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation on Fisheye Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19747v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups, ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at: https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/fishnchips</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2025</p></details> |

Conventional methods either assume high-quality inputs or employ computationally expensive cascaded processing, which limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose STAR-Pose, a spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework specifically designed for video-based human pose estimation. Our method features a novel spatial-temporal Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention, which efficiently captures long-range temporal dependencies. Moreover, it is complemented by an adaptive fusion module that integrates parallel CNN branch for local texture enhancement. We also design a pose-aware compound loss to achieve task-oriented super-resolution. This loss guides the network to reconstruct structural features that are most beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than optimizing purely for visual quality. Extensive experiments on several mainstream video HPE datasets demonstrate that STAR-Pose outperforms existing approaches. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely low-resolution (64x48) conditions while delivering 2.8x to 4.4x faster inference than cascaded approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>14pag...</summary><p>14pages 3figures, alredy submiss to PRCV 2025</p></details> |

Prior work has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human, multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline, leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions. Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods, identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[PoseGRAF: Geometric-Reinforced Adaptive Fusion for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14596v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing monocular 3D pose estimation methods primarily rely on joint positional features, while overlooking intrinsic directional and angular correlations within the skeleton. As a result, they often produce implausible poses under joint occlusions or rapid motion changes. To address these challenges, we propose the PoseGRAF framework. We first construct a dual graph convolutional structure that separately processes joint and bone graphs, effectively capturing their local dependencies. A Cross-Attention module is then introduced to model interdependencies between bone directions and joint features. Building upon this, a dynamic fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate both feature types by leveraging the relational dependencies between joints and bones. An improved Transformer encoder is further incorporated in a residual manner to generate the final output. Experimental results on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches. Additional evaluations on in-the-wild videos further validate its generalizability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/iCityLab/PoseGRAF.</p></details> |  |

However, recent progress on multi-order game-theoretic interaction within deep neural networks (DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where the expressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increased kernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modern ConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning in pure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs. MogaNet encapsulates conceptually simple yet effective convolutions and gated aggregation into a compact module, where discriminative features are efficiently gathered and contextualized adaptively. MogaNet exhibits great scalability, impressive efficiency of parameters, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ViTs and ConvNets on ImageNet and various downstream vision benchmarks, including COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, 2D&3D human pose estimation, and video prediction. Notably, MogaNet hits 80.0% and 87.8% accuracy with 5.2M and 181M parameters on ImageNet-1K, outperforming ParC-Net and ConvNeXt-L, while saving 59% FLOPs and 17M parameters, respectively.

Accurate and efficient solutions are required for several real-world applications including animation, human-robot interaction, surveillance, and sports. However, challenges such as occlusions, 2D pose mismatches, random camera perspectives, and limited 3D labelled data have been hampering the models' performance and limiting their deployment in real-world scenarios. The higher availability of cameras has led researchers to explore multi-view solutions to take advantage of the different perspectives to reconstruct the pose. Most existing reviews have mainly focused on monocular 3D human pose estimation, so a comprehensive survey on multi-view approaches has been missing since 2012. According to the reviewed articles, the majority of the existing methods are fully-supervised approaches based on geometric constraints, which are often limited by 2D pose mismatches. To mitigate this, researchers have proposed incorporating temporal consistency or depth information. Alternatively, working directly with 3D features has been shown to completely overcome this issue, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity. Additionally, models with lower levels of supervision have been identified to help address challenges such as annotated data scarcity and generalisation to new setups. Therefore, no method currently addresses all challenges associated with 3D pose reconstruction, and a trade-off between complexity and performance exists. Further research is needed to develop approaches capable of quickly inferring a highly accurate 3D pose with bearable computation cost. Techniques such as active learning, low-supervision methods, temporal consistency, view selection, depth information estimation, and multi-modal approaches are strategies to consider when developing a new method for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 tables, 6 figures, accepted at Image and Vision Computing (IMAVIS)</p></details> |

However, accurate human joint estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda) Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation, window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error. This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose, with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, this process relies on human demonstrations captured through pose estimation or motion capture systems. In this paper, we explore a text-driven approach to mapping human motion to humanoids. To address the inherent discrepancies between the generated motion representations and the kinematic constraints of humanoid robots, we propose an angle signal network based on norm-position and rotation loss (NPR Loss). It generates joint angles, which serve as inputs to a reinforcement learning-based whole-body joint motion control policy. The policy ensures tracking of the generated motions while maintaining the robot's stability during execution. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, successfully transferring text-driven human motion to a real humanoid robot NAO.</p></details> |  |

In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often observed in single-branch structures.

Our work builds upon state-of-the-art advances in the area of human pose estimation, graph-attention neural networks, and transformer interpretablity. The downstream task is to assist rehabilitation by providing informative feedback to users while they are performing prescribed exercises. We utilize a contrastive learning strategy during training. Given a tuple of correctly and incorrectly executed exercises, our model is able to identify and highlight those joints that are involved in an incorrect movement and thus require the user's attention. We collected an in-house dataset, ExeCheck, with paired recordings of both correct and incorrect execution of exercises. In our experiments, we tested our method on this dataset as well as the UI-PRMD dataset and found ExeCheck outperformed the baseline method using pairwise sequence alignment in identifying joints of physical relevance in rehabilitation exercises.</p></details> |  |

Usually, action coordination is represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA) module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

In 3D HPE, occlusions, where parts of the body are not visible in the image, pose a significant challenge for accurate pose reconstruction. This paper presents a benchmark on the robustness of 3D HPE models under realistic occlusion conditions, involving combinations of occluded keypoints commonly observed in real-world scenarios. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D HPE models, spanning convolutional, transformer-based, graph-based, and diffusion-based architectures, using the BlendMimic3D dataset, a synthetic dataset with ground-truth 2D/3D annotations and occlusion labels. All models were originally trained on Human3.6M and tested here without retraining to assess their generalization. We introduce a protocol that simulates occlusion by adding noise into 2D keypoints based on real detector behavior, and conduct both global and per-joint sensitivity analyses. Our findings reveal that all models exhibit notable performance degradation under occlusion, with diffusion-based models underperforming despite their stochastic nature. Additionally, a per-joint occlusion analysis identifies consistent vulnerability in distal joints (e.g., wrists, feet) across models. Overall, this work highlights critical limitations of current 3D HPE models in handling occlusions, and provides insights for improving real-world robustness.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases, and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable, data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

Follow-up work includes analyses and contributions that enhance the efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability of 3DGS. In this summary, we present an overview of several key directions that have emerged in the wake of 3DGS. We highlight advances enabling resource-efficient training and rendering, the evolution toward dynamic (or four-dimensional, 4DGS) representations, and deeper exploration of the mathematical foundations underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process. Furthermore, we examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for 3D vision and graphics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article written for Frontiers of Science Award, International Congress on Basic Science, 2025</p></details> |

We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring robust multimodal perception.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Disentangled 4D Gaussian Splatting (Disentangled4DGS), a novel representation and rendering pipeline that achieves real-time performance without compromising visual fidelity. Disentangled4DGS decouples the temporal and spatial components of 4D Gaussians, avoiding the need for slicing first and four-dimensional matrix calculations in prior methods. By projecting temporal and spatial deformations into dynamic 2D Gaussians and deferring temporal processing, we minimize redundant computations of 4DGS. Our approach also features a gradient-guided flow loss and temporal splitting strategy to reduce artifacts. Experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in rendering speed and quality, achieving 343 FPS when render 1352*1014 resolution images on a single RTX3090 while reducing storage requirements by at least 4.5%. Our approach sets a new benchmark for dynamic novel view synthesis, outperforming existing methods on both multi-view and monocular dynamic scene datasets.</p></details> |  |

During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Findings).

| **[The Quest for Generalizable Motion Generation: Data, Model, and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26794v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locality in Image Diffusion Models Emerges from Data Statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09672v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that the generalization ability of image diffusion models arises from the locality properties of the trained neural network. In particular, when denoising a particular pixel, the model relies on a limited neighborhood of the input image around that pixel, which, according to the previous work, is tightly related to the ability of these models to produce novel images. Since locality is central to generalization, it is crucial to understand why diffusion models learn local behavior in the first place, as well as the factors that govern the properties of locality patterns. In this work, we present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a statistical property of the image dataset and is not due to the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, as suggested in previous work. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to deep neural denoisers. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that this locality arises directly from pixel correlations present in the image datasets. Moreover, locality patterns are drastically different on specialized datasets, approximating principal components of the data's covariance. We use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than prior expert-crafted alternatives. Our key takeaway is that while neural network architectures influence generation quality, their primary role is to capture locality patterns inherent in the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 20 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[ScoreAdv: Score-based Targeted Generation of Natural Adversarial Examples via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06078v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality, while maintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.</p></details> |  |

These substructures are typically small compared to the overall graph, enabling the problem to be approached by finding a sparse solution to a linear system associated with the graph Laplacian. In this work, we first propose a method for identifying specific local clusters when very few labeled data are given, which we term semi-supervised local clustering. We then extend this approach to the unsupervised setting when no prior information on labels is available. The proposed methods involve randomly sampling the graph, applying diffusion through local cluster extraction, then examining the overlap among the results to find each cluster. We establish the co-membership conditions for any pair of nodes, and rigorously prove the correctness of our methods. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve state of the art results in the low-label rates regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Consistency Policy: Decoupling Multi-Modal Diversity and Real-Time Efficiency in Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26670v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However, approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.</p></details> |  |

Deepfake Detection in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16556v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard the public in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

Emu3.5 is pre-trained end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA), which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction, accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance. Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://emu.world</p></details> |

Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time, systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF) strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our "precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future research in efficient generative super-resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models, Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most 512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21 percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer, more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 24th International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom 2026)</p></details> |

This has raised concerns about intellectual property protection and the generation of deceptive content. Recent studies, such as Glaze and Anti-DreamBooth, have proposed using adversarial noise to protect images from these attacks. However, recent purification-based methods, such as DiffPure and Noise Upscaling, have successfully attacked these latest defenses, showing the vulnerabilities of these methods. Moreover, present methods show limited transferability across models, making them less effective against unknown text-to-image models. To address these issues, we propose a novel anti-mimicry method, StyleGuard. We propose a novel style loss that optimizes the style-related features in the latent space to make it deviate from the original image, which improves model-agnostic transferability. Additionally, to enhance the perturbation's ability to bypass diffusion-based purification, we designed a novel upscale loss that involves ensemble purifiers and upscalers during training. Extensive experiments on the WikiArt and CelebA datasets demonstrate that StyleGuard outperforms existing methods in robustness against various transformations and purifications, effectively countering style mimicry in various models. Moreover, StyleGuard is effective on different style mimicry methods, including DreamBooth and Textual Inversion. The code is available at https://github.com/PolyLiYJ/StyleGuard.</p></details> | Accepted by NIPS2025 |

For visual content, this paradigm shifts from traditional pixel-level transmission toward leveraging the semantic structure of images to communicate visual meaning. Existing approaches generally follow one of two paths: transmitting only text descriptions, which often fail to capture precise spatial layouts and fine-grained appearance details; or transmitting text alongside dense latent visual features, which tends to introduce substantial semantic redundancy. A key challenge, therefore, is to reduce semantic redundancy while preserving semantic understanding and visual fidelity, thereby improving overall transmission efficiency. This paper introduces a diffusion-based semantic communication framework with adaptive retransmission. The system transmits concise text descriptions together with a limited set of key latent visual features, and employs a diffusion-based inpainting model to reconstruct the image. A receiver-side semantic consistency mechanism is designed to evaluate the alignment between the reconstructed image and the original text description. When a semantic discrepancy is detected, the receiver triggers a retransmission to request a small set of additional latent blocks and refine the image reconstruction. This approach significantly reduces bandwidth usage while preserving high semantic accuracy, achieving an efficient balance between reconstruction quality and transmission overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ICC 2026</p></details> |

This typically leads to a range of technological issues in many fields of electrochemical technology. Presently, a particularly relevant case is that of high-energy density next-generation batteries with metal anodes, that cannot yet reach practical cyclability targets, owing to uncontrolled elelctrode shape evolution. In this scenario, mathematical modelling is a key tool to lay the knowledge-base for materials-science advancements liable to lead to concretely stable battery material architectures. In this work, we introduce the Evolving Surface DIB (ESDIB) model, a reaction-diffusion system posed on a dynamically evolving electrode surface. Unlike previous fixed-surface formulations, the ESDIB model couples surface evolution to the local concentration of electrochemical species, allowing the geometry of the electrode itself to adapt in response to deposition. To handle the challenges related to the coupling between surface motion and species transport, we numerically solve the system by proposing an extension of the Lumped Evolving Surface Finite Element Method (LESFEM) for spatial discretisation, combined with an IMEX Euler scheme for time integration. The model is validated through six numerical experiments, each compared with laboratory images of electrodeposition. Results demonstrate that the ESDIB framework accurately captures branching and dendritic growth, providing a predictive and physically consistent tool for studying metal deposition phenomena in energy storage devices.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |

Meanwhile, within language, emotion plays a crucial role in expressing personal opinions in our daily lives and the inclusion of maliciously negative content can lead users astray, exacerbating negative emotions. Recognizing the success of diffusion models and the significance of emotion, we investigate a previously overlooked risk associated with text-to-image diffusion models, that is, utilizing emotion in the input texts to introduce negative content and provoke unfavorable emotions in users. Specifically, we identify a new backdoor attack, i.e., emotion-aware backdoor attack (EmoAttack), which introduces malicious negative content triggered by emotional texts during image generation. We formulate such an attack as a diffusion personalization problem to avoid extensive model retraining and propose the EmoBooth. Unlike existing personalization methods, our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained diffusion model by establishing a mapping between a cluster of emotional words and a given reference image containing malicious negative content. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we built a dataset and conducted extensive analysis and discussion about its effectiveness. Given consumers' widespread use of diffusion models, uncovering this threat is critical for society.</p></details> |  |

Even the more concerned diffusion models need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time, self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other doses. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel method of TUnable-geneRalizatioN Diffusion (TurnDiff) powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data for low-dose CT reconstruction. Firstly, a contextual subdata self-enhancing similarity strategy is designed for denoising centered on the LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising, TurnDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing. Comprehensive evaluation on both benchmark datasets and real-world data demonstrates that TurnDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction and generalization.</p></details> |  |

Previous works focus on designing discriminative models to maintain the identity consistency despite drastic changes in camera viewpoints. The core idea behind these methods is quite natural, but designing a view-robust model is a very challenging task. Moreover, they overlook the contribution of view-specific features in enhancing the model's ability to represent persons. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework named SD-ReID for AG-ReID, which leverages generative models to mimic the feature distribution of different views while extracting robust identity representations. More specifically, we first train a ViT-based model to extract person representations along with controllable conditions, including identity and view conditions. We then fine-tune the Stable Diffusion (SD) model to enhance person representations guided by these controllable conditions. Furthermore, we introduce the View-Refined Decoder (VRD) to bridge the gap between instance-level and global-level features. Finally, both person representations and all-view features are employed to retrieve target persons. Extensive experiments on five AG-ReID benchmarks (i.e., CARGO, AG-ReIDv1, AG-ReIDv2, LAGPeR and G2APS-ReID) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

To address this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.</p></details> | Demo paper |

Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion (PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters, overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result, scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen. Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR) while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Posterior Sampling by Combining Diffusion Models with Annealed Langevin Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26324v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior $p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior sampling is computationally intractable in general. To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an $L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[GRPO-Guard: Mitigating Implicit Over-Optimization in Flow Matching via Regulated Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22319v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions, preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g., SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jingw193.github.io/GRPO-Guard/</p></details> |
| **[Neurosymbolic Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13138v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors combine neural perception with symbolic reasoning to solve tasks like visual reasoning. However, standard NeSy predictors assume conditional independence between the symbols they extract, thus limiting their ability to model interactions and uncertainty - often leading to overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution generalisation. To overcome the limitations of the independence assumption, we introduce neurosymbolic diffusion models (NeSyDMs), a new class of NeSy predictors that use discrete diffusion to model dependencies between symbols. Our approach reuses the independence assumption from NeSy predictors at each step of the diffusion process, enabling scalable learning while capturing symbol dependencies and uncertainty quantification. Across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks - including high-dimensional visual path planning and rule-based autonomous driving - NeSyDMs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy among NeSy predictors and demonstrate strong calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distributional Multi-objective Black-box Optimization for Diffusion-model Inference-time Multi-Target Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26278v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions. This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG) algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations. Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Generative Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Based on Human Cognitive Laws](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26268v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks, which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and detail quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Model-Document Protocol for AI Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that redefines how models interact with documents. We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for reasoning. As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.</p></details> | 10 pages |

A Critical Examination of Efficiency Evaluation Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18480v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through empirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration strategies to advance research on DLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn by the authors to better delineate the related work from the paper's original contributions</p></details> |

A Psychophysics-Grounded Evaluation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26241v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially, under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans. Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g., free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition) that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs.</p></details> | 10 pages |

This capability closes the experimental feedback loop, ensuring that machine learning models receive reliable structure information for real-time decision-making and optimization. Herein, we present DiSE, an end-to-end diffusion-based generative model that integrates multiple spectroscopic modalities, including MS, 13C and 1H chemical shifts, HSQC, and COSY, to achieve automated yet accurate structure elucidation of organic compounds. By learning inherent correlations among spectra through data-driven approaches, DiSE achieves superior accuracy, strong generalization across chemically diverse datasets, and robustness to experimental data despite being trained on calculated spectra. DiSE thus represents a significant advance toward fully automated structure elucidation, with broad potential in natural product research, drug discovery, and self-driving laboratories.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPARKE: Scalable Prompt-Aware Diversity and Novelty Guidance in Diffusion Models via RKE Score](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10173v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant computational costs. We release our code on the project page: https://mjalali.github.io/SPARKE</p></details> |  |
| **[Don't Let It Fade: Preserving Edits in Diffusion Language Models via Token Timestep Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26200v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps, erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0). Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving stable and controllable diffusion text generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, such modern generative models suffer from expensive inference, inhibiting their use in numerous scientific applications like Boltzmann Generators (BGs) for molecular conformations that require fast likelihood evaluation. In this paper, we revisit classical normalizing flows in the context of BGs that offer efficient sampling and likelihoods, but whose training via maximum likelihood is often unstable and computationally challenging. We propose Regression Training of Normalizing Flows (RegFlow), a novel and scalable regression-based training objective that bypasses the numerical instability and computational challenge of conventional maximum likelihood training in favour of a simple $\ell_2$-regression objective. Specifically, RegFlow maps prior samples under our flow to targets computed using optimal transport couplings or a pre-trained continuous normalizing flow (CNF). To enhance numerical stability, RegFlow employs effective regularization strategies such as a new forward-backward self-consistency loss that enjoys painless implementation. Empirically, we demonstrate that RegFlow unlocks a broader class of architectures that were previously intractable to train for BGs with maximum likelihood. We also show RegFlow exceeds the performance, computational cost, and stability of maximum likelihood training in equilibrium sampling in Cartesian coordinates of alanine dipeptide, tripeptide, and tetrapeptide, showcasing its potential in molecular systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; ICML GenBio Best Paper Award 2025</p></details> |

Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 |

However, the dozens of sampling steps they require, make inference extremely slow. Sampling acceleration techniques, particularly single-step, provide a potential solution. Nonetheless, achieving one step in VSR remains challenging, due to the high training overhead on video data and stringent fidelity demands. To tackle the above issues, we propose DOVE, an efficient one-step diffusion model for real-world VSR. DOVE is obtained by fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model (i.e., CogVideoX). To effectively train DOVE, we introduce the latent-pixel training strategy. The strategy employs a two-stage scheme to gradually adapt the model to the video super-resolution task. Meanwhile, we design a video processing pipeline to construct a high-quality dataset tailored for VSR, termed HQ-VSR. Fine-tuning on this dataset further enhances the restoration capability of DOVE. Extensive experiments show that DOVE exhibits comparable or superior performance to multi-step diffusion-based VSR methods. It also offers outstanding inference efficiency, achieving up to a 28$\times$ speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR.

Researchers have investigated various methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However, discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization. Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA (Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques, SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness. Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.</p></details> |  |

Instead of explicitly utilizing the structure of special manifolds as studied in previous works, in this paper we investigate direct sampling of the Euclidean diffusion models for general manifold-structured data. We reveal the multiscale singularity of the score function in the ambient space, which hinders the accuracy of diffusion-generated samples. We then present an elaborate theoretical analysis of the singularity structure of the score function by decomposing it along the tangential and normal directions of the manifold. To mitigate the singularity and improve the sampling accuracy, we propose two novel methods: (1) Niso-DM, which reduces the scale discrepancies in the score function by utilizing a non-isotropic noise, and (2) Tango-DM, which trains only the tangential component of the score function using a tangential-only loss function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve superior performance on distributions over various manifolds with complex geometries.</p></details> |  |
| **[A two-dimensional fractional-order element-free Galerkin method for nonlocal elasticity and complex domain problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26161v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a meshfree two-dimensional fractional-order Element-Free Galerkin (2D f-EFG) method as a viable alternative to conventional mesh-based FEM for a numerical solution of (spatial) fractional-order differential equations (FDEs). The previously developed one-dimensional f-EFG solver offers a limited demonstration of the true efficacy of EFG formulations for FDEs, as it is restricted to simple 1D line geometries. In contrast, the 2D f-EFG solver proposed and developed here effectively demonstrates the potential of meshfree approaches for solving FDEs. The proposed solver can handle complex and irregular 2D domains that are challenging for mesh-based methods. As an example, the developed framework is employed to investigate nonlocal elasticity governed by fractional-order constitutive relations in a square and circular plate. Furthermore, the proposed approach mitigates key drawbacks of FEM, including high computational cost, mesh generation, and reduced accuracy in irregular domains. The 2D f-EFG employs 2D Moving Least Squares (MLS) approximants, which are particularly effective in approximating fractional derivatives from nodal values. The 2D f-EFG solver is employed here for the numerical solution of fractional-order linear and nonlinear partial differential equations corresponding to the nonlocal elastic response of a plate. The solver developed here is validated with the benchmark results available in the literature. While the example chosen here focuses on nonlocal elasticity, the numerical method can be extended for diverse applications of fractional-order derivatives in multiscale modeling, multiphysics coupling, anomalous diffusion, and complex material behavior.</p></details> |  |

AMG is an efficient iterative solver for large-scale sparse linear systems, particularly those derived from elliptic and parabolic PDE discretizations. However, its performance heavily relies on numerous parameters, which are often set empirically and are highly sensitive to AMG's effectiveness. Traditional parameter optimization methods are either computationally expensive or lack theoretical support. To address this, we propose a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based strategy to optimize AMG parameters and introduce evaluation metrics to assess their effectiveness. Trained on small-scale datasets, GPR predicts nearly optimal parameters, bypassing the time-consuming parameter sweeping process. We also use kernel learning techniques to build a kernel function library and determine the optimal kernel function through linear combination, enhancing prediction accuracy. In numerical experiments, we tested typical PDEs such as the constant-coefficient Poisson equation, variable-coefficient Poisson equation, diffusion equation, and Helmholtz equation. Results show that GPR-predicted parameters match grid search results in iteration counts while significantly reducing computational time. A comprehensive analysis using metrics like mean squared error, prediction interval coverage, and Bayesian information criterion confirms GPR's efficiency and reliability. These findings validate GPR's effectiveness in AMG parameter optimization and provide theoretical support for AMG's practical application.</p></details> |  |

Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space, each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution, enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://fullpart3d.github.io</p></details> |

Despite progress, three key limitations persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3) Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene composition with unprecedented controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://copart3d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[3D Equivariant Visuomotor Policy Learning via Spherical Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16969v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant models have recently been shown to improve the data efficiency of diffusion policy by a significant margin. However, prior work that explored this direction focused primarily on point cloud inputs generated by multiple cameras fixed in the workspace. This type of point cloud input is not compatible with the now-common setting where the primary input modality is an eye-in-hand RGB camera like a GoPro. This paper closes this gap by incorporating into the diffusion policy model a process that projects features from the 2D RGB camera image onto a sphere. This enables us to reason about symmetries in $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ without explicitly reconstructing a point cloud. We perform extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both performance and sample efficiency. Our work, Image-to-Sphere Policy ($\textbf{ISP}$), is the first $\mathrm{SO}(3)$-equivariant policy learning framework for robotic manipulation that works using only monocular RGB inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks, especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content. Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of PReMA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cycle Diffusion Model for Counterfactual Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24267v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints, enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation, counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Super-Capacity SRS Channel Inpainting via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26097v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for reliable multiuser MIMO operation. In 5G NR, reciprocity-based beamforming via uplink Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) face resource and coverage constraints, motivating sparse non-uniform SRS allocation. Prior masked-autoencoder (MAE) approaches improve coverage but overfit to training masks and degrade under unseen distortions (e.g., additional masking, interference, clipping, non-Gaussian noise). We propose a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that integrates system-model knowledge at inference via a likelihood-gradient term, enabling a single trained model to adapt across mismatched conditions. On standardized CDL channels, the score-based diffusion variant consistently outperforms a UNet score-model baseline and the one-step MAE under distribution shift, with improvements up to 14 dB NMSE in challenging settings (e.g., Laplace noise, user interference), while retaining competitive accuracy under matched conditions. These results demonstrate that diffusion-guided inpainting is a robust and generalizable approach for super-capacity SRS design in 5G NR systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing Diffusion Transformers for Visual Correspondence by Modulating Massive Activations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18584v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained stable diffusion models (SD) have shown great advances in visual correspondence. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for accurate dense correspondence. Distinct from SD, DiTs exhibit a critical phenomenon in which very few feature activations exhibit significantly larger values than others, known as \textit{massive activations}, leading to uninformative representations and significant performance degradation for DiTs. The massive activations consistently concentrate at very few fixed dimensions across all image patch tokens, holding little local information. We trace these dimension-concentrated massive activations and find that such concentration can be effectively localized by the zero-initialized Adaptive Layer Norm (AdaLN-zero). Building on these findings, we propose Diffusion Transformer Feature (DiTF), a training-free framework designed to extract semantic-discriminative features from DiTs. Specifically, DiTF employs AdaLN to adaptively localize and normalize massive activations with channel-wise modulation. In addition, we develop a channel discard strategy to further eliminate the negative impacts from massive activations. Experimental results demonstrate that our DiTF outperforms both DINO and SD-based models and establishes a new state-of-the-art performance for DiTs in different visual correspondence tasks (\eg, with +9.4\% on Spair-71k and +4.4\% on AP-10K-C.S.).</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

We prove that the discrete energy and its continuum counterpart differ by at most $O(\varepsilon)$; the prefactor involves only the $W^{1,1}$-norm of the connectivity density as $\varepsilon\to0$, so the error bound remains valid even when that density has strong local fluctuations. As an application, we introduce a neural-network procedure that reconstructs the connectivity density from edge-weight data and then embeds the resulting continuum model into a brain-dynamics framework. In this setting, the usual constant diffusion coefficient is replaced by the spatially varying coefficient produced by the learned density, yielding dynamics that differ significantly from those obtained with conventional constant-diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional Negative Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative guidance strength and text-image alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: The First Workshop on Generative and Protective AI for Content Creation</p></details> |

In this paper, we present GameFactory, a framework for action-controlled scene-generalizable game video generation. We first address the fundamental challenge of action controllability by introducing GF-Minecraft, an action-annotated game video dataset without human bias, and developing an action control module that enables precise control over both keyboard and mouse inputs. We further extend to support autoregressive generation for unlimited-length interactive videos. More importantly, GameFactory tackles the critical challenge of scene-generalizable action control, which most existing methods fail to address. To enable the creation of entirely new and diverse games beyond fixed styles and scenes, we leverage the open-domain generative priors from pre-trained video diffusion models. To bridge the domain gap between open-domain priors and small-scale game datasets, we propose a multi-phase training strategy with a domain adapter that decouples game style learning from action control. This decoupling ensures that action control learning is no longer bound to specific game styles, thereby achieving scene-generalizable action control. Experimental results demonstrate that GameFactory effectively generates open-domain action-controllable game videos, representing a significant step forward in AI-driven game generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Highlight, Project Page: https://yujiwen.github.io/gamefactory</p></details> |
| **[Time Weaver: A Conditional Time Series Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02682v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine generating a city's electricity demand pattern based on weather, the presence of an electric vehicle, and location, which could be used for capacity planning during a winter freeze. Such real-world time series are often enriched with paired heterogeneous contextual metadata (e.g., weather and location). Current approaches to time series generation often ignore this paired metadata. Additionally, the heterogeneity in metadata poses several practical challenges in adapting existing conditional generation approaches from the image, audio, and video domains to the time series domain. To address this gap, we introduce TIME WEAVER, a novel diffusion-based model that leverages the heterogeneous metadata in the form of categorical, continuous, and even time-variant variables to significantly improve time series generation. Additionally, we show that naive extensions of standard evaluation metrics from the image to the time series domain are insufficient. These metrics do not penalize conditional generation approaches for their poor specificity in reproducing the metadata-specific features in the generated time series. Thus, we innovate a novel evaluation metric that accurately captures the specificity of conditional generation and the realism of the generated time series. We show that TIME WEAVER outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by up to 30% in downstream classification tasks on real-world energy, medical, air quality, and traffic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Posterior Sampling: Time Series Generation with Hard Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12652v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stress-testing models and protecting user privacy by using synthetic data. In engineering and safety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints ($\sim100$) without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 70\% and 22\%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[OnlyFlow: Optical Flow based Motion Conditioning for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10501v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of text-to-video generation tasks with precise control for various applications such as camera movement control and video-to-video editing. Most methods tacking this problem rely on providing user-defined controls, such as binary masks or camera movement embeddings. In our approach we propose OnlyFlow, an approach leveraging the optical flow firstly extracted from an input video to condition the motion of generated videos. Using a text prompt and an input video, OnlyFlow allows the user to generate videos that respect the motion of the input video as well as the text prompt. This is implemented through an optical flow estimation model applied on the input video, which is then fed to a trainable optical flow encoder. The output feature maps are then injected into the text-to-video backbone model. We perform quantitative, qualitative and user preference studies to show that OnlyFlow positively compares to state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of tasks, even though OnlyFlow was not specifically trained for such tasks. OnlyFlow thus constitutes a versatile, lightweight yet efficient method for controlling motion in text-to-video generation. Models and code will be made available on GitHub and HuggingFace.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 supplementary page, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[GenIR: Generative Visual Feedback for Mental Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06220v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind. That is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation for future research in this direction</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT), allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image. BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.</p></details> |  |

| **[Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges. Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models. Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed STM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreeArt3D: Training-Free Articulated Object Generation using 3D Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25765v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR, and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in both quality and versatility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Guided Conditional Diffusion Networks for Microwave Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25729v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A conditional latent-diffusion based framework for solving the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem associated with microwave imaging is introduced. This generative machine-learning model explicitly mirrors the non-uniqueness of the ill-posed inverse problem. Unlike existing inverse solvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a single reconstruction, the proposed latent-diffusion model generates multiple plausible permittivity maps conditioned on measured scattered-field data, thereby generating several potential instances in the range-space of the non-unique inverse mapping. A forward electromagnetic solver is integrated into the reconstruction pipeline as a physics-based evaluation mechanism. The space of candidate reconstructions form a distribution of possibilities consistent with the conditioning data and the member of this space yielding the lowest scattered-field data discrepancy between the predicted and measured scattered fields is reported as the final solution. Synthetic and experimental labeled datasets are used for training and evaluation of the model. An innovative labeled synthetic dataset is created that exemplifies a varied set of scattering features. Training of the model using this new dataset produces high quality permittivity reconstructions achieving improved generalization with excellent fidelity to shape recognition. The results highlight the potential of hybrid generative physics frameworks as a promising direction for robust, data-driven microwave imaging.</p></details> |  |

Binaspect generates interpretable "azimuth maps" by calculating modified interaural time and level difference spectrograms, and clustering those time-frequency (TF) bins into stable time-azimuth histogram representations. This allows multiple active sources to appear as distinct azimuthal clusters, while degradations manifest as broadened, diffused, or shifted distributions. Crucially, Binaspect operates blindly on audio, requiring no prior knowledge of head models. These visualizations enable researchers and engineers to observe how binaural cues are degraded by codec and renderer design choices, among other downstream processes. We demonstrate the tool on bitrate ladders, ambisonic rendering, and VBAP source positioning, where degradations are clearly revealed. In addition to their diagnostic value, the proposed representations can be exported as structured features suitable for training machine learning models in quality prediction, spatial audio classification, and other binaural tasks. Binaspect is released under an open-source license with full reproducibility scripts at https://github.com/QxLabIreland/Binaspect.</p></details> |  |

Recent training-free methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing (LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance to enhance global structure during the denoising process.

Current methods suffer from two fundamental limitations: the scarcity of full-band RIR datasets and the inability of existing models to generate acoustically accurate responses from diverse input modalities. We present PromptReverb, a two-stage generative framework that addresses these challenges. Our approach combines a variational autoencoder that upsamples band-limited RIRs to full-band quality (48 kHz), and a conditional diffusion transformer model based on rectified flow matching that generates RIRs from descriptions in natural language. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that PromptReverb produces RIRs with superior perceptual quality and acoustic accuracy compared to existing methods, achieving 8.8% mean RT60 error compared to -37% for widely used baselines and yielding more realistic room-acoustic parameters. Our method enables practical applications in virtual reality, architectural acoustics, and audio production where flexible, high-quality RIR synthesis is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables; v2: corrected spelling of a co-author name; no content changes</p></details> |

Deep learning methods have recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data, inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues, we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3) controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold 3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers $3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in training.</p></details> | technical report |

Furthermore, we investigate the differential behaviour with respect to alternative operations for all classes of optimal 4-bit s-boxes, as defined by Leander and Poschmann (2007). Our examination reveals that certain classes contain weak permutations w.r.t. alternative differential attacks. Finally, we leverage these vulnerabilities to execute a series of experiments showing the effectiveness of the cryptanalysis performed with a parallel alternative operation compared to the classical one.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Discrete Mathematics</p></details> |

We study the resulting computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and transparent proofs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Off-policy Reinforcement Learning with Model-based Exploration Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25529v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration. The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning, leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across complex control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonparametric estimation of homogenized invariant measures from multiscale data via Hermite expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25521v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of density estimation in the context of multiscale Langevin diffusion processes, where a single-scale homogenized surrogate model can be derived. In particular, our aim is to learn the density of the invariant measure of the homogenized dynamics from a continuous-time trajectory generated by the full multiscale system. We propose a spectral method based on a truncated Fourier expansion with Hermite functions as orthonormal basis. The Fourier coefficients are computed directly from the data owing to the ergodic theorem. We prove that the resulting density estimator is robust and converges to the invariant density of the homogenized model as the scale separation parameter vanishes, provided the time horizon and the number of Fourier modes are suitably chosen in relation to the multiscale parameter. The accuracy and reliability of this methodology is further demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScribbleVS: Scribble-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Dynamic Competitive Pseudo Label Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10237v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In clinical medicine, precise image segmentation can provide substantial support to clinicians. However, obtaining high-quality segmentation typically demands extensive pixel-level annotations, which are labor-intensive and expensive. Scribble annotations offer a more cost-effective alternative by improving labeling efficiency. Nonetheless, using such sparse supervision for training reliable medical image segmentation models remains a significant challenge. Some studies employ pseudo-labeling to enhance supervision, but these methods are susceptible to noise interference. To address these challenges, we introduce ScribbleVS, a framework designed to learn from scribble annotations. We introduce a Regional Pseudo Labels Diffusion Module to expand the scope of supervision and reduce the impact of noise present in pseudo labels. Additionally, we introduce a Dynamic Competitive Selection module for enhanced refinement in selecting pseudo labels. Experiments conducted on the ACDC, MSCMRseg, WORD, and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate promising results, achieving segmentation precision comparable to fully supervised models. The codes of this study are available at https://github.com/ortonwang/ScribbleVS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Temporal Consistency and Fidelity at Inference-time in Perceptual Video Restoration by Zero-shot Image-based Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25420v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for single-image restoration, but their application to zero-shot video restoration suffers from temporal inconsistencies due to the stochastic nature of sampling and complexity of incorporating explicit temporal modeling. In this work, we address the challenge of improving temporal coherence in video restoration using zero-shot image-based diffusion models without retraining or modifying their architecture. We propose two complementary inference-time strategies: (1) Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) based on the neuroscience-inspired perceptual straightening hypothesis, which steers the diffusion denoising process towards smoother temporal evolution by incorporating a curvature penalty in a perceptual space to improve temporal perceptual scores, such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and perceptual straightness; and (2) Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling (MPES), which aims at reducing stochastic variation by ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity (distortion) scores, such as PSNR and SSIM, without sacrificing sharpness. Together, these training-free techniques provide a practical path toward temporally stable high-fidelity perceptual video restoration using large pretrained diffusion models. We performed extensive experiments over multiple datasets and degradation types, systematically evaluating each strategy to understand their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while PSG enhances temporal naturalness, particularly in case of temporal blur, MPES consistently improves fidelity and spatio-temporal perception--distortion trade-off across all tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmegAMP: Targeted AMP Discovery through Biologically Informed Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17247v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based antimicrobial peptide (AMP) discovery faces critical challenges such as limited controllability, lack of representations that efficiently model antimicrobial properties, and low experimental hit rates. To address these challenges, we introduce OmegAMP, a framework designed for reliable AMP generation with increased controllability. Its diffusion-based generative model leverages a novel conditioning mechanism to achieve fine-grained control over desired physicochemical properties and to direct generation towards specific activity profiles, including species-specific effectiveness. This is further enhanced by a biologically informed encoding space that significantly improves overall generative performance. Complementing these generative capabilities, OmegAMP leverages a novel synthetic data augmentation strategy to train classifiers for AMP filtering, drastically reducing false positive rates and thereby increasing the likelihood of experimental success. Our in silico experiments demonstrate that OmegAMP delivers state-of-the-art performance across key stages of the AMP discovery pipeline, enabling us to achieve an unprecedented success rate in wet lab experiments. We tested 25 candidate peptides, 24 of them (96%) demonstrated antimicrobial activity, proving effective even against multi-drug resistant strains. Our findings underscore OmegAMP's potential to significantly advance computational frameworks in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Leakage and Complexity: Towards Realistic and Efficient Information Cascade Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25348v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup, dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks, Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage popularity conversions--a practical task critical for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
