| **[UnPose: Uncertainty-Guided Diffusion Priors for Zero-Shot Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15972v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However, acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available, we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent 3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2025.

| **[Learning Point Cloud Representations with Pose Continuity for Depth-Based Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14358v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25 benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at https://github.com/zhujunli1993/HRC-Pose.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 Workshop on Recovering 6D Object Pose (R6D)</p></details> |
| **[MR6D: Benchmarking 6D Pose Estimation for Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13775v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators, interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/anas-gouda/mr6d.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted CVPR 2025 Workshop on Recovering 6D Object Pose (R6D)</p></details> |
| **[RCGNet: RGB-based Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation with Geometric Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13623v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally, we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.</p></details> | Accepted by IROS2025 |
| **[Novel Object 6D Pose Estimation with a Single Reference View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05578v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing novel object 6D pose estimation methods typically rely on CAD models or dense reference views, which are both difficult to acquire. Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in a common coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative object-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting. Code will be released at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/SinRef-6D.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures (including supplementary material)</p></details> |
| **[Level-Set Parameters: Novel Representation for 3D Shape Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13502v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D shape analysis has been largely focused on traditional 3D representations of point clouds and meshes, but the discrete nature of these data makes the analysis susceptible to variations in input resolutions. Recent development of neural fields brings in level-set parameters from signed distance functions as a novel, continuous, and numerical representation of 3D shapes, where the shape surfaces are defined as zero-level-sets of those functions. This motivates us to extend shape analysis from the traditional 3D data to these novel parameter data. Since the level-set parameters are not Euclidean like point clouds, we establish correlations across different shapes by formulating them as a pseudo-normal distribution, and learn the distribution prior from the respective dataset. To further explore the level-set parameters with shape transformations, we propose to condition a subset of these parameters on rotations and translations, and generate them with a hypernetwork. This simplifies the pose-related shape analysis compared to using traditional data. We demonstrate the promise of the novel representations through applications in shape classification (arbitrary poses), retrieval, and 6D object pose estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask6D: Masked Pose Priors For 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06486v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous end-to-end pose estimation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2024. 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[SenseShift6D: Multimodal RGB-D Benchmarking for Robust 6D Pose Estimation across Environment and Sensor Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05751v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures, 9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels. For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire 101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive, self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain real-world environments. Our dataset is available at: huggingface.co/datasets/Yegyu/SenseShift6D Associated scripts can be found at: github.com/yegyu-han/SenseShift6D</p></details> |  |
| **[Computer Vision for Objects used in Group Work: Challenges and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00224v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive and spatially aware technologies are transforming educational frameworks, particularly in K-12 settings where hands-on exploration fosters deeper conceptual understanding. However, during collaborative tasks, existing systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale. This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods' object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results, and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AIED 2025 Late Breaking Results Track</p></details> |
| **[Monocular One-Shot Metric-Depth Alignment for RGB-Based Robot Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17110v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision, which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras), and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[XYZ-IBD: A High-precision Bin-picking Dataset for Object 6D Pose Estimation Capturing Real-world Industrial Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00599v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce XYZ-IBD, a bin-picking dataset for 6D pose estimation that captures real-world industrial complexity, including challenging object geometries, reflective materials, severe occlusions, and dense clutter. The dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on household objects, which approach saturation,XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved realistic industrial conditions. The dataset features 15 texture-less, metallic, and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density, replicating the challenges of real-world bin-picking. XYZ-IBD was collected using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view real-world scenes, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks. By capturing the complexity of real-world bin-picking scenarios, XYZ-IBD introduces more realistic and challenging problems for future research. The dataset and benchmark are publicly available at https://xyz-ibd.github.io/XYZ-IBD/.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Hand Object Pose Estimation via Visual-Tactile Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10787v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate in-hand pose estimation is crucial for robotic object manipulation, but visual occlusion remains a major challenge for vision-based approaches. This paper presents an approach to robotic in-hand object pose estimation, combining visual and tactile information to accurately determine the position and orientation of objects grasped by a robotic hand. We address the challenge of visual occlusion by fusing visual information from a wrist-mounted RGB-D camera with tactile information from vision-based tactile sensors mounted on the fingertips of a robotic gripper. Our approach employs a weighting and sensor fusion module to combine point clouds from heterogeneous sensor types and control each modality's contribution to the pose estimation process. We use an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm adapted for weighted point clouds to estimate the 6D object pose. Our experiments show that incorporating tactile information significantly improves pose estimation accuracy, particularly when occlusion is high. Our method achieves an average pose estimation error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only baselines by up to 20%. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to perform precise object manipulation in a real-world insertion task.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Accurate and efficient zero-shot 6D pose estimation with frozen foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09784v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable 8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[CHIP: A multi-sensor dataset for 6D pose estimation of chairs in industrial settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09699v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D pose estimation of complex objects in 3D environments is essential for effective robotic manipulation. Yet, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating 6D pose estimation methods under realistic industrial conditions, as most datasets focus on household objects in domestic settings, while the few available industrial datasets are limited to artificial setups with objects placed on tables. To bridge this gap, we introduce CHIP, the first dataset designed for 6D pose estimation of chairs manipulated by a robotic arm in a real-world industrial environment. CHIP includes seven distinct chairs captured using three different RGBD sensing technologies and presents unique challenges, such as distractor objects with fine-grained differences and severe occlusions caused by the robotic arm and human operators. CHIP comprises 77,811 RGBD images annotated with ground-truth 6D poses automatically derived from the robot's kinematics, averaging 11,115 annotations per chair. We benchmark CHIP using three zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods, assessing performance across different sensor types, localization priors, and occlusion levels. Results show substantial room for improvement, highlighting the unique challenges posed by the dataset. CHIP will be publicly released.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[UA-Pose: Uncertainty-Aware 6D Object Pose Estimation and Online Object Completion with Partial References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07996v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects. However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed 3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating 6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are incomplete or partially captured.

| **[You Only Estimate Once: Unified, One-stage, Real-Time Category-level Articulated Object 6D Pose Estimation for Robotic Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05719v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[MTevent: A Multi-Task Event Camera Dataset for 6D Pose Estimation and Moving Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11282v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots are reaching unprecedented speeds, with platforms like Unitree B2, and Fraunhofer O3dyn achieving maximum speeds between 5 and 10 m/s. However, effectively utilizing such speeds remains a challenge due to the limitations of RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and fail to provide real-time responsiveness. Event cameras, with their asynchronous operation, and low-latency sensing, offer a promising alternative for high-speed robotic perception. In this work, we introduce MTevent, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation and moving object detection in highly dynamic environments with large detection distances. Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an RGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16 unique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles, varying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine high-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions, making it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To establish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's FoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with ground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in such dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve perception models and foster further research in high-speed robotic vision.

The vast majority of existing methods rely on instance-specific CAD models or require depth sensors to resolve geometric ambiguities, making them impractical for real-world agricultural applications. In this work, we introduce PLANTPose, a novel framework for category-level 6D pose estimation that operates purely on RGB input. PLANTPose predicts both the 6D pose and deformation parameters relative to a base mesh, allowing a single category-level CAD model to adapt to unseen instances. This enables accurate pose estimation across varying shapes without relying on instance-specific data. To enhance realism and improve generalization, we also leverage Stable Diffusion to refine synthetic training images with realistic texturing, mimicking variations due to ripeness and environmental factors and bridging the domain gap between synthetic data and the real world. Our evaluations on a challenging benchmark that includes bananas of various shapes, sizes, and ripeness status demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in handling large intraclass variations while maintaining accurate 6D pose predictions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art RGB-based approach MegaPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

| **[RefPose: Leveraging Reference Geometric Correspondences for Accurate 6D Pose Estimation of Unseen Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10841v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of unseen objects from monocular RGB images remains a challenging problem, especially due to the lack of prior object-specific knowledge. To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to object pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric correspondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using object templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric correspondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage, RefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the generated references and iteratively refines the pose through a render-and-compare approach. To enhance this estimation, we introduce a correlation volume-guided attention mechanism that effectively captures correlations between the query and reference images. Unlike traditional methods that depend on pre-defined object models, RefPose dynamically adapts to new object shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence. This results in robust performance across previously unseen objects. Extensive evaluation on the BOP benchmark datasets shows that RefPose achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining a competitive runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[One2Any: One-Reference 6D Pose Estimation for Any Object](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04109v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation remains challenging for many applications due to dependencies on complete 3D models, multi-view images, or training limited to specific object categories. These requirements make generalization to novel objects difficult for which neither 3D models nor multi-view images may be available. To address this, we propose a novel method One2Any that estimates the relative 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) object pose using only a single reference-single query RGB-D image, without prior knowledge of its 3D model, multi-view data, or category constraints. We treat object pose estimation as an encoding-decoding process, first, we obtain a comprehensive Reference Object Pose Embedding (ROPE) that encodes an object shape, orientation, and texture from a single reference view. Using this embedding, a U-Net-based pose decoding module produces Reference Object Coordinate (ROC) for new views, enabling fast and accurate pose estimation. This simple encoding-decoding framework allows our model to be trained on any pair-wise pose data, enabling large-scale training and demonstrating great scalability. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model generalizes well to novel objects, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness even rivaling methods that require multi-view or CAD inputs, at a fraction of compute.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Category-Level and Open-Set Object Pose Estimation for Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19572v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation enables a variety of tasks in computer vision and robotics, including scene understanding and robotic grasping. The complexity of a pose estimation task depends on the unknown variables related to the target object. While instance-level methods already excel for opaque and Lambertian objects, category-level and open-set methods, where texture, shape, and size are partially or entirely unknown, still struggle with these basic material properties. Since texture is unknown in these scenarios, it cannot be used for disambiguating object symmetries, another core challenge of 6D object pose estimation. The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of unknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions.

| **[CordViP: Correspondence-based Visuomotor Policy for Dexterous Manipulation in Real-World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08449v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving human-level dexterity in robots is a key objective in the field of robotic manipulation. Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have shown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal. However, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems: (1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is significantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and occlusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack crucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations, we propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns correspondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and robot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware point clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand. These point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also incorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in six real-world tasks, surpassing other baselines by a large margin. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness of CordViP to different objects, viewpoints, and scenarios.

In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have similar rankings on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21--29% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still -35% behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023), and the 2D detection stage is consequently the main bottleneck of existing pipelines for 6D localization/detection of unseen objects. The online evaluation system stays open and is available at http://bop.felk.cvut.cz/</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.09799</p></details> |

While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Most recent 6D object pose methods rely on refinement to get accurate results. However, most existing refinement methods either suffer from noises in establishing correspondences, or rely on retraining for novel objects. SCFlow2 is based on the SCFlow model designed for refinement with shape constraint, but formulates the additional depth as a regularization in the iteration via 3D scene flow for RGBD frames. The key design of SCFlow2 is an introduction of geometry constraints into the training of recurrent matching network, by combining the rigid-motion embeddings in 3D scene flow and 3D shape prior of the target. We train SCFlow2 on a combination of dataset Objaverse, GSO and ShapeNet, and evaluate on BOP datasets with novel objects. After using our method as a post-processing, most state-of-the-art methods produce significantly better results, without any retraining or fine-tuning.

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Vanishing Depth, a self-supervised training approach that extends pretrained RGB encoders to incorporate and align metric depth into their feature embeddings. Based on our novel positional depth encoding, we enable stable depth density and depth distribution invariant feature extraction. We achieve performance improvements and SOTA results across a spectrum of relevant RGBD downstream tasks - without the necessity of finetuning the encoder. Most notably, we achieve 56.05 mIoU on SUN-RGBD segmentation, 88.3 RMSE on Void's depth completion, and 83.8 Top 1 accuracy on NYUv2 scene classification. In 6D-object pose estimation, we outperform our predecessors of DinoV2, EVA-02, and Omnivore and achieve SOTA results for non-finetuned encoders in several related RGBD downstream tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Unlike existing methods that rely on textured 3D models or multiple viewpoints, Any6D leverages a joint object alignment process to enhance 2D-3D alignment and metric scale estimation for improved pose accuracy. Our approach integrates a render-and-compare strategy to generate and refine pose hypotheses, enabling robust performance in scenarios with occlusions, non-overlapping views, diverse lighting conditions, and large cross-environment variations.

| **[GDRNPP: A Geometry-guided and Fully Learning-based Object Pose Estimator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12145v5)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D pose estimation of rigid objects is a long-standing and challenging task in computer vision. Recently, the emergence of deep learning reveals the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict reliable 6D poses. Given that direct pose regression networks currently exhibit suboptimal performance, most methods still resort to traditional techniques to varying degrees. For example, top-performing methods often adopt an indirect strategy by first establishing 2D-3D or 3D-3D correspondences followed by applying the RANSAC-based PnP or Kabsch algorithms, and further employing ICP for refinement. Despite the performance enhancement, the integration of traditional techniques makes the networks time-consuming and not end-to-end trainable. Orthogonal to them, this paper introduces a fully learning-based object pose estimator. In this work, we first perform an in-depth investigation of both direct and indirect methods and propose a simple yet effective Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDRN) to learn the 6D pose from monocular images in an end-to-end manner. Afterwards, we introduce a geometry-guided pose refinement module, enhancing pose accuracy when extra depth data is available. Guided by the predicted coordinate map, we build an end-to-end differentiable architecture that establishes robust and accurate 3D-3D correspondences between the observed and rendered RGB-D images to refine the pose. Our enhanced pose estimation pipeline GDRNPP (GDRN Plus Plus) conquered the leaderboard of the BOP Challenge for two consecutive years, becoming the first to surpass all prior methods that relied on traditional techniques in both accuracy and speed.

Recent advancements have expanded this estimation from instance-level to category-level, allowing models to generalize across unseen instances within the same category. However, this generalization is limited by the narrow range of categories covered by existing datasets, such as NOCS, which also tend to overlook common real-world challenges like occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Omni6D, a comprehensive RGBD dataset featuring a wide range of categories and varied backgrounds, elevating the task to a more realistic context. 1) The dataset comprises an extensive spectrum of 166 categories, 4688 instances adjusted to the canonical pose, and over 0.8 million captures, significantly broadening the scope for evaluation. 2) We introduce a symmetry-aware metric and conduct systematic benchmarks of existing algorithms on Omni6D, offering a thorough exploration of new challenges and insights. 3) Additionally, we propose an effective fine-tuning approach that adapts models from previous datasets to our extensive vocabulary setting. We believe this initiative will pave the way for new insights and substantial progress in both the industrial and academic fields, pushing forward the boundaries of general 6D pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 (poster).

| **[LuciBot: Automated Robot Policy Learning from Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09871v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generating training supervision for embodied tasks is crucial, as manual designing is tedious and not scalable. While prior works use large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rewards, these approaches are largely limited to simple tasks with well-defined rewards, such as pick-and-place. This limitation arises because LLMs struggle to interpret complex scenes compressed into text or code due to their restricted input modality, while VLM-based rewards, though better at visual perception, remain limited by their less expressive output modality. To address these challenges, we leverage the imagination capability of general-purpose video generation models. Given an initial simulation frame and a textual task description, the video generation model produces a video demonstrating task completion with correct semantics. We then extract rich supervisory signals from the generated video, including 6D object pose sequences, 2D segmentations, and estimated depth, to facilitate task learning in simulation. Our approach significantly improves supervision quality for complex embodied tasks, enabling large-scale training in simulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal 3D Mesh Reconstruction from Images and Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07190v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation for unseen objects is essential in robotics but traditionally relies on trained models that require large datasets, high computational costs, and struggle to generalize. Zero-shot approaches eliminate the need for training but depend on pre-existing 3D object models, which are often impractical to obtain. To address this, we propose a language-guided few-shot 3D reconstruction method, reconstructing a 3D mesh from few input images. In the proposed pipeline, receives a set of input images and a language query. A combination of GroundingDINO and Segment Anything Model outputs segmented masks from which a sparse point cloud is reconstructed with VGGSfM. Subsequently, the mesh is reconstructed with the Gaussian Splatting method SuGAR. In a final cleaning step, artifacts are removed, resulting in the final 3D mesh of the queried object. We evaluate the method in terms of accuracy and quality of the geometry and texture. Furthermore, we study the impact of imaging conditions such as viewing angle, number of input images, and image overlap on 3D object reconstruction quality, efficiency, and computational scalability.</p></details> | under review |
| **[AxisPose: Model-Free Matching-Free Single-Shot 6D Object Pose Estimation via Axis Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06660v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation, which plays a vital role in robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving, has been of great interest in computer vision. Existing studies either require multi-stage pose regression or rely on 2D-3D feature matching. Though these approaches have shown promising results, they rely heavily on appearance information, requiring complex input (i.e., multi-view reference input, depth, or CAD models) and intricate pipeline (i.e., feature extraction-SfM-2D to 3D matching-PnP). We propose AxisPose, a model-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation, which fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing methods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM and PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by leveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects without reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation Module (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes through a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the gradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain the geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated tri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module (TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose achieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N instances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with great potential for generalization to unseen-object level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active 6D Pose Estimation for Textureless Objects using Multi-View RGB Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03726v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of textureless objects from RBG images is an important problem in robotics. Due to appearance ambiguities, rotational symmetries, and severe occlusions, single-view based 6D pose estimators are still unable to handle a wide range of objects, motivating research towards multi-view pose estimation and next-best-view prediction that addresses these limitations. In this work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for estimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our approach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a sequential two-step process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency. First, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth ambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify the subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through canonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then introduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera viewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty and enhancing pose accuracy. We evaluate our method on the public ROBI dataset as well as on a transparent object dataset that we created. When evaluated using the same camera viewpoints, our multi-view pose estimation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by leveraging our next-best-view strategy, our method achieves high object pose accuracy with substantially fewer viewpoints than heuristic-based policies.</p></details> |  |

Our novel BOP-compatible dataset, featuring a diverse set of metallic objects (cans, household, and industrial items) under various lighting and background conditions, provides additional geometric and visual cues. We demonstrate that these cues can be effectively leveraged to enhance overall performance. To illustrate the usefulness of the additional features, we improve upon the GDRNPP algorithm by introducing an additional keypoint prediction and material estimator head in order to improve spatial scene understanding. Evaluations on the new dataset show improved accuracy for metallic objects, supporting the hypothesis that additional geometric and visual cues can improve learning.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we present a pipeline for the precise tool positioning of heavy-duty, long-reach (HDLR) manipulators using advanced machine vision. A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration to estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI). Based on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with motion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool positioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and control methods prevalent in the industry. The proposed methodology comprises orientation and position alignment based on the visually estimated OOI poses, whereas camera-to-robot calibration is conducted based on motion utilizing visual SLAM. The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from rigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via image-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation, only synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world setting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results demonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2 mm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to increase the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR manipulators.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances improving speed and accuracy in pose estimation, finding a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy poses significant challenges in dynamic environments. Most current algorithms lack scalability in estimation time, especially for diverse datasets, and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are often too slow. This study focuses on developing a fast and scalable set of pose estimators based on GDRNPP to meet or exceed current benchmarks in accuracy and robustness, particularly addressing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off essential in real-time scenarios. We propose the AMIS algorithm to tailor the utilized model according to an application-specific trade-off between inference time and accuracy. We further show the effectiveness of the AMIS-based model choice on four prominent benchmark datasets (LM-O, YCB-V, T-LESS, and ITODD).</p></details> |  |

While existing methods can estimate the precise 6D pose of objects, they heavily rely on curated CAD models or reference images, the preparation of which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, 3D models or reference images may not be available in advance and instant robot reaction is desired. In this work, we propose a novel framework named HIPPo, which eliminates the need for curated CAD models and reference images by harnessing image-to-3D priors from Diffusion Models, enabling model-free zero-shot 6D pose estimation. Specifically, we construct HIPPo Dreamer, a rapid image-to-mesh model built on a multiview Diffusion Model and a 3D reconstruction foundation model. Our HIPPo Dreamer can generate a 3D mesh of any unseen objects from a single glance in just a few seconds. Then, as more observations are acquired, we propose to continuously refine the diffusion prior mesh model by joint optimization of object geometry and appearance. This is achieved by a measurement-guided scheme that gradually replaces the plausible diffusion priors with more reliable online observations. Consequently, HIPPo can instantly estimate and track the 6D pose of a novel object and maintain a complete mesh for immediate robotic applications. Thorough experiments on various benchmarks show that HIPPo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 6D object pose estimation when prior reference images are limited.</p></details> |  |

Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve ambiguous cases due to geometrically symmetric objects that is based on visual features. We comprehensively evaluate FreeZe across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, which include over a hundred 3D objects and 20,000 images captured in various scenarios.

To solve this, we present ReFlow6D, a novel method for transparent object 6D pose estimation that harnesses the refractive-intermediate representation. Unlike conventional approaches, our method leverages a feature space impervious to changes in RGB image space and independent of depth information. Drawing inspiration from image matting, we model the deformation of the light path through transparent objects, yielding a unique object-specific intermediate representation guided by light refraction that is independent of the environment in which objects are observed. By integrating these intermediate features into the pose estimation network, we show that ReFlow6D achieves precise 6D pose estimation of transparent objects, using only RGB images as input. Our method further introduces a novel transparent object compositing loss, fostering the generation of superior refractive-intermediate features. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TOD and Trans32K-6D datasets. Robot grasping experiments further demonstrate that ReFlow6D's pose estimation accuracy effectively translates to real-world robotics task.

| **[KITchen: A Real-World Benchmark and Dataset for 6D Object Pose Estimation in Kitchen Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16238v3)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent progress on 6D object pose estimation methods for robotic grasping, a substantial performance gap persists between the capabilities of these methods on existing datasets and their efficacy in real-world grasping and mobile manipulation tasks, particularly when robots rely solely on their monocular egocentric field of view (FOV). Existing real-world datasets primarily focus on table-top grasping scenarios, where a robot arm is placed in a fixed position and the objects are centralized within the FOV of fixed external camera(s). Assessing performance on such datasets may not accurately reflect the challenges encountered in everyday grasping and mobile manipulation tasks within kitchen environments such as retrieving objects from higher shelves, sinks, dishwashers, ovens, refrigerators, or microwaves. To address this gap, we present KITchen, a novel benchmark designed specifically for estimating the 6D poses of objects located in diverse positions within kitchen settings. For this purpose, we recorded a comprehensive dataset comprising around 205k real-world RGBD images for 111 kitchen objects captured in two distinct kitchens, utilizing a humanoid robot with its egocentric perspectives. Subsequently, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline, to streamline the labeling process of such datasets, resulting in the generation of 2D object labels, 2D object segmentation masks, and 6D object poses with minimal human effort. The benchmark, the dataset, and the annotation pipeline will be publicly available at https://kitchen-dataset.github.io/KITchen.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publishing at The 2024 IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots</p></details> |

Our approach relies on the evaluation of discrepancies in the geometry of the observed object, in particular its respective estimated back-projection in 3D, against a putative functional shape representation comprising mixtures of Gaussian Processes, that act as a template. Each Gaussian Process is trained to yield a fragment of the object's surface in a radial fashion with respect to designated reference points. We further define a pose confidence measure as the average probability of pixel back-projections in the Gaussian mixture. The goal of our experiments is two-fold. a) We demonstrate that our functional representation is sufficiently accurate as a shape template on which the probability of back-projected object points can be evaluated, and, b) we show that the resulting confidence scores based on these probabilities are indeed a consistent quality measure of pose.</p></details> |  |

Most current approaches are restricted to specific instances with known models or require ground truth depth information or point cloud captures from LIDAR. We tackle the harder problem of pose estimation for category-level objects from a single RGB image. We propose a novel solution that eliminates the need for specific object models or depth information. Our method utilises score-based diffusion models to generate object pose hypotheses to model the distribution of possible poses for the object. Unlike previous methods that rely on costly trained likelihood estimators to remove outliers before pose aggregation using mean pooling, we introduce a simpler approach using Mean Shift to estimate the mode of the distribution as the final pose estimate. Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the REAL275 dataset by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

It is particularly challenging in bin-picking applications, where objects may be textureless and in difficult poses, and occlusion between objects of the same type may cause confusion even in well-trained models. We propose a novel method of hard example synthesis that is model-agnostic, using existing simulators and the modeling of pose error in both the camera-to-object viewsphere and occlusion space. Through evaluation of the model performance with respect to the distribution of object poses and occlusions, we discover regions of high error and generate realistic training samples to specifically target these regions. With our training approach, we demonstrate an improvement in correct detection rate of up to 20% across several ROBI-dataset objects using state-of-the-art pose estimation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

In particular, partial observability, occlusions, and object symmetries eventually result in pose ambiguity. To account for this multimodality, this work proposes training a diffusion-based generative model for 6D object pose estimation. During inference, the trained generative model allows for sampling multiple particles, i.e., pose hypotheses. To distill this information into a single pose estimate, we propose two novel and effective pose selection strategies that do not require any additional training or computationally intensive operations. Moreover, while many existing methods for pose estimation primarily focus on the image domain and only incorporate depth information for final pose refinement, our model solely operates on point cloud data. The model thereby leverages recent advancements in point cloud processing and operates upon an SE(3)-equivariant latent space that forms the basis for the particle selection strategies and allows for improved inference times. Our thorough experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach on the Linemod dataset and showcase the effectiveness of our design choices.

Occlusion and incomplete object visibility are common challenges in this task, but existing pose refinement methods often struggle to handle these issues effectively. To tackle this problem, we propose a global motion-guided recurrent flow estimation method called GMFlow for pose estimation. GMFlow overcomes local ambiguities caused by occlusion or missing parts by seeking global explanations. We leverage the object's structural information to extend the motion of visible parts of the rigid body to its invisible regions. Specifically, we capture global contextual information through a linear attention mechanism and guide local motion information to generate global motion estimates. Furthermore, we introduce object shape constraints in the flow iteration process, making flow estimation suitable for pose estimation scenarios. Experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in accuracy while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GS2Pose: Two-stage 6D Object Pose Estimation Guided by Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03807v3)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a new method for accurate and robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects, named GS2Pose. By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose can utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD model, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input. Specifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse estimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight U-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is designed. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images. GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly competitive results. The code for GS2Pose will soon be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Existing 6D pose estimation networks are often too large for such deployments, necessitating compression while maintaining reliable performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Modular Quantization-Aware Training (MQAT), an adaptive and mixed-precision quantization-aware training strategy that exploits the modular structure of modern 6D pose estimation architectures. MQAT guides a systematic gradated modular quantization sequence and determines module-specific bit precisions, leading to quantized models that outperform those produced by state-of-the-art uniform and mixed-precision quantization techniques. Our experiments showcase the generality of MQAT across datasets, architectures, and quantization algorithms. Remarkably, MQAT-trained quantized models achieve a significant accuracy boost (>7%) over the baseline full-precision network while reducing model size by a factor of 4x or more.

| **[ZeroPose: CAD-Prompted Zero-shot Object 6D Pose Estimation in Cluttered Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17934v3)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robotics and industry applications have a high demand for the capability to estimate the 6D pose of novel objects from the cluttered scene. However, existing classic pose estimation methods are object-specific, which can only handle the specific objects seen during training. When applied to a novel object, these methods necessitate a cumbersome onboarding process, which involves extensive dataset preparation and model retraining. The extensive duration and resource consumption of onboarding limit their practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce ZeroPose, a novel zero-shot framework that performs pose estimation following a Discovery-Orientation-Registration (DOR) inference pipeline. This framework generalizes to novel objects without requiring model retraining. Given the CAD model of a novel object, ZeroPose enables in seconds onboarding time to extract visual and geometric embeddings from the CAD model as a prompt. With the prompting of the above embeddings, DOR can discover all related instances and estimate their 6D poses without additional human interaction or presupposing scene conditions. Compared with existing zero-shot methods solved by the render-and-compare paradigm, the DOR pipeline formulates the object pose estimation into a feature-matching problem, which avoids time-consuming online rendering and improves efficiency. Experimental results on the seven datasets show that ZeroPose as a zero-shot method achieves comparable performance with object-specific training methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot method with 50x inference speed improvement.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a technical description of the European Space Agency's (ESA) project "AI for AR in Satellite AIT," which combines real-time computer vision and AR systems to assist technicians during satellite assembly. Leveraging Microsoft HoloLens 2 as the AR interface, the system delivers context-aware instructions and real-time feedback, tackling the complexities of object recognition and 6D pose estimation in AIT workflows. All AI models demonstrated over 70% accuracy, with the detection model exceeding 95% accuracy, indicating a high level of performance and reliability. A key contribution of this work lies in the effective use of synthetic data for training AI models in AR applications, addressing the significant challenges of obtaining real-world datasets in highly dynamic satellite environments, as well as the creation of the Segmented Anything Model for Automatic Labelling (SAMAL), which facilitates the automatic annotation of real data, achieving speeds up to 20 times faster than manual human annotation. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of AI-driven AR systems in automating critical satellite assembly tasks, setting a foundation for future innovations in the space industry.</p></details> |  |

This problem is of particular interest for many practical applications in industrial tasks such as quality control, bin picking, and robotic manipulation, where both speed and accuracy are critical for real-world deployment. Current models, both classical and deep-learning-based, often struggle with the trade-off between accuracy and latency. Our research focuses on enhancing the speed of a prominent state-of-the-art deep learning model, GDRNPP, while keeping its high accuracy. We employ several techniques to reduce the model size and improve inference time. These techniques include using smaller and quicker backbones, pruning unnecessary parameters, and distillation to transfer knowledge from a large, high-performing model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed configuration maintains accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art while significantly improving inference time. This advancement could lead to more efficient and practical applications in various industrial scenarios, thereby enhancing the overall applicability of 6D Object Pose Estimation models in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art 6D object pose estimators directly predict an object pose given an object observation. Due to the ill-posed nature of the pose estimation problem, where multiple different poses can correspond to a single observation, generating additional plausible estimates per observation can be valuable. To address this, we reformulate the state-of-the-art algorithm GDRNPP and introduce EPRO-GDR (End-to-End Probabilistic Geometry-Guided Regression). Instead of predicting a single pose per detection, we estimate a probability density distribution of the pose. Using the evaluation procedure defined by the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) Challenge, we test our approach on four of its core datasets and demonstrate superior quantitative results for EPRO-GDR on LM-O, YCB-V, and ITODD. Our probabilistic solution shows that predicting a pose distribution instead of a single pose can improve state-of-the-art single-view pose estimation while providing the additional benefit of being able to sample multiple meaningful pose candidates.</p></details> |  |

However, recent methods for directly regressing poses from RGB images using dense features have achieved state-of-the-art results. Stereo vision, which provides an additional perspective on the object, can help reduce pose ambiguity and occlusion. Moreover, stereo can directly infer the distance of an object, while mono-vision requires internalized knowledge of the object's size. To extend the state-of-the-art in 6D object pose estimation to stereo, we created a BOP compatible stereo version of the YCB-V dataset. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation algorithms by utilizing stereo vision and can easily be adopted for other dense feature-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>4th I...</summary><p>4th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (ICPRAI)</p></details> |

In this context, RGB image and point-cloud observations are two commonly used modalities in visual-based robotic manipulation, but each of these modalities have their own limitations. Commercial point-cloud observations often suffer from issues like sparse sampling and noisy output due to the limits of the emission-reception imaging principle. On the other hand, RGB images, while rich in texture information, lack essential depth and 3D information crucial for robotic manipulation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an image-only robotic manipulation framework that leverages an eye-on-hand monocular camera installed on the robot's parallel gripper. By moving with the robot gripper, this camera gains the ability to actively perceive object from multiple perspectives during the manipulation process. This enables the estimation of 6D object poses, which can be utilized for manipulation. While, obtaining images from more and diverse viewpoints typically improves pose estimation, it also increases the manipulation time. To address this trade-off, we employ a reinforcement learning policy to synchronize the manipulation strategy with active perception, achieving a balance between 6D pose accuracy and manipulation efficiency. Our experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments showcase the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our approach. %, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve robust real-world robotic manipulation through active pose estimation. We believe that our method will inspire further research on real-world-oriented robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

To detect and grasp novel objects, zero-shot pose estimators determine poses without prior knowledge. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have shown considerable advances in robotics applications by establishing an understanding between language input and image input. In our work, we take advantage of VLMs zero-shot capabilities and translate this ability to 6D object pose estimation. We propose a novel framework for promptable zero-shot 6D object pose estimation using language embeddings. The idea is to derive a coarse location of an object based on the relevancy map of a language-embedded NeRF reconstruction and to compute the pose estimate with a point cloud registration method. Additionally, we provide an analysis of LERF's suitability for open-set object pose estimation. We examine hyperparameters, such as activation thresholds for relevancy maps and investigate the zero-shot capabilities on an instance- and category-level. Furthermore, we plan to conduct robotic grasping experiments in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Gaussian for Monocular 6D Pose Estimation from Sparse Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02581v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular object pose estimation, as a pivotal task in computer vision and robotics, heavily depends on accurate 2D-3D correspondences, which often demand costly CAD models that may not be readily available. Object 3D reconstruction methods offer an alternative, among which recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) afford a compelling potential. Yet its performance still suffers and tends to overfit with fewer input views. Embracing this challenge, we introduce SGPose, a novel framework for sparse view object pose estimation using Gaussian-based methods. Given as few as ten views, SGPose generates a geometric-aware representation by starting with a random cuboid initialization, eschewing reliance on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline-derived geometry as required by traditional 3DGS methods. SGPose removes the dependence on CAD models by regressing dense 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model from sparse input and random initialization, while the geometric-consistent depth supervision and online synthetic view warping are key to the success. Experiments on typical benchmarks, especially on the Occlusion LM-O dataset, demonstrate that SGPose outperforms existing methods even under sparse view constraints, under-scoring its potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

GS-Pose begins with a set of posed RGB images of a previously unseen object and builds three distinct representations stored in a database. At inference, GS-Pose operates sequentially by locating the object in the input image, estimating its initial 6D pose using a retrieval approach, and refining the pose with a render-and-compare method. The key insight is the application of the appropriate object representation at each stage of the process. In particular, for the refinement step, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique that offers high rendering speed and relatively low optimization time. Off-the-shelf toolchains and commodity hardware, such as mobile phones, can be used to capture new objects to be added to the database.

We initially detect instance-wise keypoints with a YOLOv8s model to compute 6D pose estimates of known objects by solving PnP. We use a ray tracing approach to track a geometric scene graph consisting of mesh models of object instances. In contrast to classical point-to-point matching, this leads to more robust results, especially under occlusions between objects instances. We show that using this hybrid strategy leads to robust self-localization, pre-segmentation of the range sensor data and accurate pose tracking of objects using the same environmental representation. All detected objects are integrated into a semantic scene graph. This scene graph then serves as a front end to a semantic mapping framework to allow spatial reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certifying Robustness of Learning-Based Keypoint Detection and Pose Estimation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00117v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the certification of the local robustness of vision-based two-stage 6D object pose estimation. The two-stage method for object pose estimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural network-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods' robustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on their local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust estimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform the certification of local robustness into neural network verification for classification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output specifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate verification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear operations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of injecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull representation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict semantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we propagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then formulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the setting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each pixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear, classification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both sound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on realistic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to certify the robustness of large-scale, keypoint-based pose estimation given images in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Unlike most existing real-world object-centric datasets which only come with RGB capturing, the direct capture of the depth channel allows better 3D annotations and broader downstream applications. WildRGB-D comprises large-scale category-level RGB-D object videos, which are taken using an iPhone to go around the objects in 360 degrees. It contains around 8500 recorded objects and nearly 20000 RGB-D videos across 46 common object categories.

The widely available, inexpensive and high-resolution RGB sensors and CNNs that allow for fast inference based on this modality make monocular approaches especially well suited for robotics applications. We observe that previous surveys on object pose estimation establish the state of the art for varying modalities, single- and multi-view settings, and datasets and metrics that consider a multitude of applications. We argue, however, that those works' broad scope hinders the identification of open challenges that are specific to monocular approaches and the derivation of promising future challenges for their application in robotics. By providing a unified view on recent publications from both robotics and computer vision, we find that occlusion handling, novel pose representations, and formalizing and improving category-level pose estimation are still fundamental challenges that are highly relevant for robotics. Moreover, to further improve robotic performance, large object sets, novel objects, refractive materials, and uncertainty estimates are central, largely unsolved open challenges.

However, textureless and metallic objects still pose a significant challenge due to few visual cues and the texture bias of CNNs. To address his issue, we propose a strategy for inducing a shape bias to CNN training. In particular, by randomizing textures applied to object surfaces during data rendering, we create training data without consistent textural cues. This methodology allows for seamless integration into existing data rendering engines, and results in negligible computational overhead for data rendering and network training. Our findings demonstrate that the shape bias we induce via randomized texturing, improves over existing approaches using style transfer. We evaluate with three detectors and two pose estimators. For the most recent object detector and for pose estimation in general, estimation accuracy improves for textureless and metallic objects. Additionally we show that our approach increases the pose estimation accuracy in the presence of image noise and strong illumination changes.

| **[FoundPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with Foundation Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18809v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FoundPose, a model-based method for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single RGB image. The method can quickly onboard new objects using their 3D models without requiring any object- or task-specific training. In contrast, existing methods typically pre-train on large-scale, task-specific datasets in order to generalize to new objects and to bridge the image-to-model domain gap. We demonstrate that such generalization capabilities can be observed in a recent vision foundation model trained in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, our method estimates the object pose from image-to-model 2D-3D correspondences, which are established by matching patch descriptors from the recent DINOv2 model between the image and pre-rendered object templates. We find that reliable correspondences can be established by kNN matching of patch descriptors from an intermediate DINOv2 layer. Such descriptors carry stronger positional information than descriptors from the last layer, and we show their importance when semantic information is ambiguous due to object symmetries or a lack of texture. To avoid establishing correspondences against all object templates, we develop an efficient template retrieval approach that integrates the patch descriptors into the bag-of-words representation and can promptly propose a handful of similarly looking templates. Additionally, we apply featuremetric alignment to compensate for discrepancies in the 2D-3D correspondences caused by coarse patch sampling. The resulting method noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for refinement-free pose estimation on the standard BOP benchmark with seven diverse datasets and can be seamlessly combined with an existing render-and-compare refinement method to achieve RGB-only state-of-the-art results.

Both factors limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a pipeline that does not require CAD models and allows training a state-of-the-art pose estimator requiring only a small set of real images as input. Our method is based on a NeuS2 object representation, that we learn through a semi-automated procedure based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and object-agnostic segmentation. We exploit the novel-view synthesis ability of NeuS2 and simple cut-and-paste augmentation to automatically generate photorealistic object renderings, which we use to train the correspondence-based SurfEmb pose estimator. We evaluate our method on the LINEMOD-Occlusion dataset, extensively studying the impact of its individual components and showing competitive performance with respect to approaches based on CAD models and PBR data. We additionally demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of our pipeline on self-collected real-world objects, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art CAD-model-free approaches, with better accuracy and robustness to mild occlusions. To allow the robotics community to benefit from this system, we will publicly release it at https://www.github.com/ethz-asl/neusurfemb.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2024. 8 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Our approach combines keypoint-based method with learnable pose regression through `keypoint-graph', which is a graph representation of the keypoints. KGpose first estimates 3D keypoints for each object using an attentional multi-modal feature fusion of RGB and point cloud features. These keypoints are estimated from each point of point cloud and converted into a graph representation. The network directly regresses 6D pose parameters for each point through a sequence of keypoint-graph embedding and local graph embedding which are designed with graph convolutions, followed by rotation and translation heads. The final pose for each object is selected from the candidates of point-wise predictions. The method achieves competitive results on the benchmark dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. KGpose enables multi-object pose estimation without requiring an extra localization step, offering a unified and efficient solution for understanding geometric contexts in complex scenes for robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable using natural language descriptions to support 6D pose estimation of unseen objects, these solutions underperform compared to model-based methods. In this work we present Horyon, an open-vocabulary VLM-based architecture that addresses relative pose estimation between two scenes of an unseen object, described by a textual prompt only. We use the textual prompt to identify the unseen object in the scenes and then obtain high-resolution multi-scale features. These features are used to extract cross-scene matches for registration. We evaluate our model on a benchmark with a large variety of unseen objects across four datasets, namely REAL275, Toyota-Light, Linemod, and YCB-Video. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, outperforming by 12.6 in Average Recall the previous best-performing approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

In contrast to existing approaches, in our setting (i) the object of interest is specified solely through the textual prompt, (ii) no object model (e.g., CAD or video sequence) is required at inference, and (iii) the object is imaged from two RGBD viewpoints of different scenes. To operate in this setting, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model to segment the object of interest from the scenes and to estimate its relative 6D pose. The key of our approach is a carefully devised strategy to fuse object-level information provided by the prompt with local image features, resulting in a feature space that can generalize to novel concepts. We validate our approach on a new benchmark based on two popular datasets, REAL275 and Toyota-Light, which collectively encompass 34 object instances appearing in four thousand image pairs. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both a well-established hand-crafted method and a recent deep learning-based baseline in estimating the relative 6D pose of objects in different scenes.

We train a Diffusion Model to bridge this gap using a relatively small dataset of real-world images randomly collected from unlabeled everyday objects via the DIGIT sensor. Subsequently, we employ a simulator to generate images by uniformly sampling the surface of objects from the YCB Model Set. These simulated images are then translated into the real domain using the Diffusion Model and automatically labeled to train a classifier. During this training, we further align features of the two domains using an adversarial procedure. Our evaluation is conducted on a dataset of tactile images obtained from a set of ten 3D printed YCB objects. The results reveal a total accuracy of 81.9%, a significant improvement compared to the 34.7% achieved by the classifier trained solely on simulated images. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. We further validate our approach using the classifier on a 6D object pose estimation task from tactile data.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, accepted to ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Learning based approaches typically require training data from a highly accurate CAD model or labeled training data acquired using a complex setup. We address this by learning to estimate pose from weakly labeled data without a known CAD model. We propose to use a NeRF to learn object shape implicitly which is later used to learn view-invariant features in conjunction with CNN using a contrastive loss. While NeRF helps in learning features that are view-consistent, CNN ensures that the learned features respect symmetry. During inference, CNN is used to predict view-invariant features which can be used to establish correspondences with the implicit 3d model in NeRF. The correspondences are then used to estimate the pose in the reference frame of NeRF. Our approach can also handle symmetric objects unlike other approaches using a similar training setup. Specifically, we learn viewpoint invariant, discriminative features using NeRF which are later used for pose estimation. We evaluated our approach on LM, LM-Occlusion, and T-Less dataset and achieved benchmark accuracy despite using weakly labeled data.</p></details> | 3DV 2024 |

This scarcity impedes comprehensive evaluation of model performance, limiting research advancements. Furthermore, the restricted number of available instances or categories curtails its applications. To address these issues, this paper introduces Omni6DPose, a substantial dataset characterized by its diversity in object categories, large scale, and variety in object materials. Omni6DPose is divided into three main components: ROPE (Real 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), which includes 332K images annotated with over 1.5M annotations across 581 instances in 149 categories; SOPE(Simulated 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), consisting of 475K images created in a mixed reality setting with depth simulation, annotated with over 5M annotations across 4162 instances in the same 149 categories; and the manually aligned real scanned objects used in both ROPE and SOPE. Omni6DPose is inherently challenging due to the substantial variations and ambiguities. To address this challenge, we introduce GenPose++, an enhanced version of the SOTA category-level pose estimation framework, incorporating two pivotal improvements: Semantic-aware feature extraction and Clustering-based aggregation. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive benchmarking analysis to evaluate the performance of previous methods on this large-scale dataset in the realms of 6D object pose estimation and pose tracking.</p></details> |  |

Given challenges like rust, high reflectivity, and absent textures, this paper introduces a point cloud based pose estimation framework (PS6D). PS6D centers on slender and multi-symmetric objects. It extracts multi-scale features through an attention-guided feature extraction module, designs a symmetry-aware rotation loss and a center distance sensitive translation loss to regress the pose of each point to the centroid of the instance, and then uses a two-stage clustering method to complete instance segmentation and pose estimation. Objects from the Sil\'eane and IPA datasets and typical workpieces from industrial practice are used to generate data and evaluate the algorithm. In comparison to the state-of-the-art approach, PS6D demonstrates an 11.5\% improvement in F$_{1_{inst}}$ and a 14.8\% improvement in Recall. The main part of PS6D has been deployed to the software of Mech-Mind, and achieves a 91.7\% success rate in bin-picking experiments, marking its application in industrial pose estimation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Domain randomization hereby plays an important role in reducing the simulation to reality gap. However, this generalization might not be effective in specialized domains like a production environment involving complex assemblies. Either the individual parts, trained with synthetic images, are integrated in much larger assemblies making them indistinguishable from their counterparts and result in false positives or are partially occluded just enough to give rise to false negatives. Domain knowledge is vital in these cases and if conceived effectively while generating synthetic data, can show a considerable improvement in bridging the simulation to reality gap. This paper focuses on synthetic data generation procedures for parts and assemblies used in a production environment. The basic procedures for synthetic data generation and their various combinations are evaluated and compared on images captured in a production environment, where results show up to 15% improvement using combinations of basic procedures. Reducing the simulation to reality gap in this way can aid to utilize the true potential of robot assisted production using artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, LaTeX; typos corrected; has not been presented in any conference or published in journal</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose MatchU, a Fuse-Describe-Match strategy for 6D pose estimation from RGB-D images. MatchU is a generic approach that fuses 2D texture and 3D geometric cues for 6D pose prediction of unseen objects. We rely on learning geometric 3D descriptors that are rotation-invariant by design. By encoding pose-agnostic geometry, the learned descriptors naturally generalize to unseen objects and capture symmetries. To tackle ambiguous associations using 3D geometry only, we fuse additional RGB information into our descriptor. This is achieved through a novel attention-based mechanism that fuses cross-modal information, together with a matching loss that leverages the latent space learned from RGB data to guide the descriptor learning process. Extensive experiments reveal the generalizability of both the RGB-D fusion strategy as well as the descriptor efficacy. Benefiting from the novel designs, MatchU surpasses all existing methods by a significant margin in terms of both accuracy and speed, even without the requirement of expensive re-training or rendering.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, in high risk scenarios such as human-robot interaction, industrial inspection, and automation, reliable pose estimates are crucial. In the last years, increasingly accurate and robust deep-learning-based approaches for 6D object pose estimation have been proposed. Many top-performing methods are not end-to-end trainable but consist of multiple stages. In the context of deep uncertainty quantification, deep ensembles are considered as state of the art since they have been proven to produce well-calibrated and robust uncertainty estimates. However, deep ensembles can only be applied to methods that can be trained end-to-end. In this work, we propose a method to quantify the uncertainty of multi-stage 6D object pose estimation approaches with deep ensembles. For the implementation, we choose SurfEmb as representative, since it is one of the top-performing 6D object pose estimation approaches in the BOP Challenge 2022. We apply established metrics and concepts for deep uncertainty quantification to evaluate the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel uncertainty calibration score for regression tasks to quantify the quality of the estimated uncertainty.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Specifically, we first uniformly sample point cloud and extract local geometry features with the designed local feature extractor base on graph convolution network. To improve robustness to occlusion, we adopt Transformer to perform the exchange of global information, making each local feature contains global information. Finally, we introduce geometry-aware module in Transformer Encoder, which to form an effective constrain for point cloud feature learning and makes the global information exchange more tightly coupled with point cloud tasks. Extensive experiments indicate the effectiveness of TransPose, our pose estimation pipeline achieves competitive results on three benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NEUROCOMPUTING</p></details> |

In this area, dense correspondence-based methods have achieved leading performance. However, they do not explicitly consider the local and global geometric information of different instances, resulting in poor generalization ability to unseen instances with significant shape variations. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel Instance-Adaptive and Geometric-Aware Keypoint Learning method for category-level 6D object pose estimation (AG-Pose), which includes two key designs: (1) The first design is an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Detection module, which can adaptively detect a set of sparse keypoints for various instances to represent their geometric structures. (2) The second design is a Geometric-Aware Feature Aggregation module, which can efficiently integrate the local and global geometric information into keypoint features. These two modules can work together to establish robust keypoint-level correspondences for unseen instances, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the model.Experimental results on CAMERA25 and REAL275 datasets show that the proposed AG-Pose outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin without category-specific shape priors.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

We bridge the gap between these two setups with a neural implicit representation that allows for effective novel view synthesis, keeping the downstream pose estimation modules invariant under the same unified framework. Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation. Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin.

Inspired by their denoising capability, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework (6D-Diff) to handle the noise and indeterminacy in object pose estimation for better performance. In our framework, to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondence, we formulate 2D keypoints detection as a reverse diffusion (denoising) process. To facilitate such a denoising process, we design a Mixture-of-Cauchy-based forward diffusion process and condition the reverse process on the object features.

Specifically, previous methods for novel objects do not make good use of the target object's 3D shape information since they focus on generalization by processing the shape indirectly, making them less effective. We present GenFlow, an approach that enables both accuracy and generalization to novel objects with the guidance of the target object's shape. Our method predicts optical flow between the rendered image and the observed image and refines the 6D pose iteratively. It boosts the performance by a constraint of the 3D shape and the generalizable geometric knowledge learned from an end-to-end differentiable system. We further improve our model by designing a cascade network architecture to exploit the multi-scale correlations and coarse-to-fine refinement. GenFlow ranked first on the unseen object pose estimation benchmarks in both the RGB and RGB-D cases. It also achieves performance competitive with existing state-of-the-art methods for the seen object pose estimation without any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Uncertain pose estimates can lead to task failures; however, a certain degree of error in the pose estimates is often acceptable. Hence, by quantifying errors in the object pose estimate and acceptable errors for task success, robots can make informed decisions. This is a challenging problem as both the object pose uncertainty and acceptable error for the robotic task are often multi-modal and cannot be parameterized with commonly used uni-modal distributions. In this paper, we introduce a framework for evaluating robotic task success under object pose uncertainty, representing both the estimated error space of the object pose and the acceptable error space for task success using multi-modal non-parametric probability distributions. The proposed framework pre-computes the acceptable error space for task success using dynamic simulations and subsequently integrates the pre-computed acceptable error space over the estimated error space of the object pose to predict the likelihood of the task success. We evaluated the proposed framework on two mobile manipulation tasks. Our results show that by representing the estimated and the acceptable error space using multi-modal non-parametric distributions, we achieve higher task success rates and fewer failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

GigaPose first leverages discriminative "templates", rendered images of the CAD models, to recover the out-of-plane rotation and then uses patch correspondences to estimate the four remaining parameters. Our approach samples templates in only a two-degrees-of-freedom space instead of the usual three and matches the input image to the templates using fast nearest-neighbor search in feature space, results in a speedup factor of 35x compared to the state of the art. Moreover, GigaPose is significantly more robust to segmentation errors. Our extensive evaluation on the seven core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated with existing refinement methods. Additionally, we show the potential of GigaPose with 3D models predicted by recent work on 3D reconstruction from a single image, relaxing the need for CAD models and making 6D pose object estimation much more convenient.

Despite the impressive progress enabled by deep learning, single-view RGB pose estimation models perform poorly in cluttered dynamic environments. Imbuing the rich temporal information contained in the video of scenes has the potential to enhance models ability to deal with the adverse effects of occlusion and the dynamic nature of the environments. Moreover, joint object detection and pose estimation models are better suited to leverage the co-dependent nature of the tasks for improving the accuracy of both tasks. To this end, we propose attention-based temporal fusion for multi-object 6D pose estimation that accumulates information across multiple frames of a video sequence. Our MOTPose method takes a sequence of images as input and performs joint object detection and pose estimation for all objects in one forward pass. It learns to aggregate both object embeddings and object parameters over multiple time steps using cross-attention-based fusion modules. We evaluate our method on the physically-realistic cluttered bin-picking dataset SynPick and the YCB-Video dataset and demonstrate improved pose estimation accuracy as well as better object detection accuracy</p></details> |  |

Fortunately, the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has showcased remarkable zero-shot transfer performance, which provides a promising solution to tackle this task. Motivated by this, we introduce SAM-6D, a novel framework designed to realize the task through two steps, including instance segmentation and pose estimation. Given the target objects, SAM-6D employs two dedicated sub-networks, namely Instance Segmentation Model (ISM) and Pose Estimation Model (PEM), to perform these steps on cluttered RGB-D images. ISM takes SAM as an advanced starting point to generate all possible object proposals and selectively preserves valid ones through meticulously crafted object matching scores in terms of semantics, appearance and geometry. By treating pose estimation as a partial-to-partial point matching problem, PEM performs a two-stage point matching process featuring a novel design of background tokens to construct dense 3D-3D correspondence, ultimately yielding the pose estimates.

Current methods for scene understanding typically rely on a combination of trained models paired with either an explicit or learnt volumetric representation, all of which have their own drawbacks and limitations. We introduce DreamUp3D, a novel Object-Centric Generative Model (OCGM) designed explicitly to perform inference on a 3D scene informed only by a single RGB-D image. DreamUp3D is a self-supervised model, trained end-to-end, and is capable of segmenting objects, providing 3D object reconstructions, generating object-centric latent representations and accurate per-object 6D pose estimates. We compare DreamUp3D to baselines including NeRFs, pre-trained CLIP-features, ObSurf, and ObPose, in a range of tasks including 3D scene reconstruction, object matching and object pose estimation. Our experiments show that our model outperforms all baselines by a significant margin in real-world scenarios displaying its applicability for 3D scene understanding tasks while meeting the strict demands exhibited in robotics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving 2D-3D Dense Correspondences with Diffusion Models for 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06436v1)** | 2024-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating 2D-3D correspondences between RGB images and 3D space is a fundamental problem in 6D object pose estimation. Recent pose estimators use dense correspondence maps and Point-to-Point algorithms to estimate object poses. The accuracy of pose estimation depends heavily on the quality of the dense correspondence maps and their ability to withstand occlusion, clutter, and challenging material properties. Currently, dense correspondence maps are estimated using image-to-image translation models based on GANs, Autoencoders, or direct regression models. However, recent advancements in image-to-image translation have led to diffusion models being the superior choice when evaluated on benchmarking datasets. In this study, we compare image-to-image translation networks based on GANs and diffusion models for the downstream task of 6D object pose estimation. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion-based image-to-image translation model outperforms the GAN, revealing potential for further improvements in 6D object pose estimation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the First Austrian Symposium on AI, Robotics, and Vision 2024</p></details> |
| **[LocPoseNet: Robust Location Prior for Unseen Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16290v3)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object location prior is critical for the standard 6D object pose estimation setting. The prior can be used to initialize the 3D object translation and facilitate 3D object rotation estimation. Unfortunately, the object detectors that are used for this purpose do not generalize to unseen objects. Therefore, existing 6D pose estimation methods for unseen objects either assume the ground-truth object location to be known or yield inaccurate results when it is unavailable. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a method, LocPoseNet, able to robustly learn location prior for unseen objects. Our method builds upon a template matching strategy, where we propose to distribute the reference kernels and convolve them with a query to efficiently compute multi-scale correlations. We then introduce a novel translation estimator, which decouples scale-aware and scale-robust features to predict different object location parameters. Our method outperforms existing works by a large margin on LINEMOD and GenMOP. We further construct a challenging synthetic dataset, which allows us to highlight the better robustness of our method to various noise sources.

| **[Leveraging Positional Encoding for Robust Multi-Reference-Based Object 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16284v1)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating the pose of an object is a crucial task in computer vision and robotics. There are two main deep learning approaches for this: geometric representation regression and iterative refinement. However, these methods have some limitations that reduce their effectiveness. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and propose new strategies to overcome them. To tackle the issue of blurry geometric representation, we use positional encoding with high-frequency components for the object's 3D coordinates. To address the local minimum problem in refinement methods, we introduce a normalized image plane-based multi-reference refinement strategy that's independent of intrinsic matrix constraints. Lastly, we utilize adaptive instance normalization and a simple occlusion augmentation method to help our model concentrate on the target object. Our experiments on Linemod, Linemod-Occlusion, and YCB-Video datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods. We will soon release the code.</p></details> |  |

To evaluate the robustness of SNEs on noisy data, we create a large-scale synthetic surface normal (SSN) dataset containing 20 scenarios (ten indoor scenarios and ten outdoor scenarios with and without random Gaussian noise added to depth images). Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3F2N+ achieves greater performance than all other geometry-based surface normal estimators, with average angular errors of 7.85$^\circ$, 8.95$^\circ$, 9.25$^\circ$, and 11.98$^\circ$ on the clean-indoor, clean-outdoor, noisy-indoor, and noisy-outdoor datasets, respectively. We conduct three additional experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating our proposed 3F2N+ into downstream robot perception tasks, including freespace detection, 6D object pose estimation, and point cloud completion.

Building on successful instance-level approaches, research is shifting towards category-level pose estimation for practical applications. Current category-level datasets, however, fall short in annotation quality and pose variety. Addressing this, we introduce HouseCat6D, a new category-level 6D pose dataset. It features 1) multi-modality with Polarimetric RGB and Depth (RGBD+P), 2) encompasses 194 diverse objects across 10 household categories, including two photometrically challenging ones, and 3) provides high-quality pose annotations with an error range of only 1.35 mm to 1.74 mm. The dataset also includes 4) 41 large-scale scenes with comprehensive viewpoint and occlusion coverage, 5) a checkerboard-free environment, and 6) dense 6D parallel-jaw robotic grasp annotations. Additionally, we present benchmark results for leading category-level pose estimation networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visually Guided Model Predictive Robot Control via 6D Object Pose Localization and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05344v1)** | 2023-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of this work is to enable manipulation tasks with respect to the 6D pose of a dynamically moving object using a camera mounted on a robot. Examples include maintaining a constant relative 6D pose of the robot arm with respect to the object, grasping the dynamically moving object, or co-manipulating the object together with a human. Fast and accurate 6D pose estimation is crucial to achieve smooth and stable robot control in such situations. The contributions of this work are three fold. First, we propose a new visual perception module that asynchronously combines accurate learning-based 6D object pose localizer and a high-rate model-based 6D pose tracker. The outcome is a low-latency accurate and temporally consistent 6D object pose estimation from the input video stream at up to 120 Hz. Second, we develop a visually guided robot arm controller that combines the new visual perception module with a torque-based model predictive control algorithm. Asynchronous combination of the visual and robot proprioception signals at their corresponding frequencies results in stable and robust 6D object pose guided robot arm control. Third, we experimentally validate the proposed approach on a challenging 6D pose estimation benchmark and demonstrate 6D object pose-guided control with dynamically moving objects on a real 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE(3) Diffusion Model-based Point Cloud Registration for Robust 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17359v1)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce an SE(3) diffusion model-based point cloud registration framework for 6D object pose estimation in real-world scenarios. Our approach formulates the 3D registration task as a denoising diffusion process, which progressively refines the pose of the source point cloud to obtain a precise alignment with the model point cloud. Training our framework involves two operations: An SE(3) diffusion process and an SE(3) reverse process. The SE(3) diffusion process gradually perturbs the optimal rigid transformation of a pair of point clouds by continuously injecting noise (perturbation transformation). By contrast, the SE(3) reverse process focuses on learning a denoising network that refines the noisy transformation step-by-step, bringing it closer to the optimal transformation for accurate pose estimation. Unlike standard diffusion models used in linear Euclidean spaces, our diffusion model operates on the SE(3) manifold. This requires exploiting the linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{se}(3)$ associated with SE(3) to constrain the transformation transitions during the diffusion and reverse processes. Additionally, to effectively train our denoising network, we derive a registration-specific variational lower bound as the optimization objective for model learning. Furthermore, we show that our denoising network can be constructed with a surrogate registration model, making our approach applicable to different deep registration networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our diffusion registration framework presents outstanding pose estimation performance on the real-world TUD-L, LINEMOD, and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS-2023</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Based Object 6D-Pose Estimation during Non-Prehensile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13572v3)** | 2023-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method to track the 6D pose of an object over time, while the object is under non-prehensile manipulation by a robot. At any given time during the manipulation of the object, we assume access to the robot joint controls and an image from a camera. We use the robot joint controls to perform a physics-based prediction of how the object might be moving. We then combine this prediction with the observation coming from the camera, to estimate the object pose as accurately as possible. We use a particle filtering approach to combine the control information with the visual information. We compare the proposed method with two baselines: (i) using only an image-based pose estimation system at each time-step, and (ii) a particle filter which does not perform the computationally expensive physics predictions, but assumes the object moves with constant velocity. Our results show that making physics-based predictions is worth the computational cost, resulting in more accurate tracking, and estimating object pose even when the object is not clearly visible to the camera.</p></details> |  |

| **[Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation with Hierarchical Temporal Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21363v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1) Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[PersPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation with Perspective Encoding and Perspective Rotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17239v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding (PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly, which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject, thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework, PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach.

| **[Bring Your Rear Cameras for Egocentric 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11652v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric 3D human pose estimation has been actively studied using cameras installed in front of a head-mounted device (HMD). While frontal placement is the optimal and the only option for some tasks, such as hand tracking, it remains unclear if the same holds for full-body tracking due to self-occlusion and limited field-of-view coverage. Notably, even the state-of-the-art methods often fail to estimate accurate 3D poses in many scenarios, such as when HMD users tilt their heads upward -- a common motion in human activities. A key limitation of existing HMD designs is their neglect of the back of the body, despite its potential to provide crucial 3D reconstruction cues. Hence, this paper investigates the usefulness of rear cameras for full-body tracking. We also show that simply adding rear views to the frontal inputs is not optimal for existing methods due to their dependence on individual 2D joint detectors without effective multi-view integration. To address this issue, we propose a new transformer-based method that refines 2D joint heatmap estimation with multi-view information and heatmap uncertainty, thereby improving 3D pose tracking. Also, we introduce two new large-scale datasets, Ego4View-Syn and Ego4View-RW, for a rear-view evaluation. Our experiments show that the new camera configurations with back views provide superior support for 3D pose tracking compared to only frontal placements. The proposed method achieves significant improvement over the current state of the art (>10% on MPJPE).

This scenario poses a challenge in extracting and leveraging multi-scale features, which is often essential for precise inference. To address this challenge, we propose a new attention mechanism, named cascaded multi-scale attention (CMSA), tailored for use in CNN-ViT hybrid architectures, to handle low-resolution inputs effectively. The design of CMSA enables the extraction and seamless integration of features across various scales without necessitating the downsampling of the input image or feature maps. This is achieved through a novel combination of grouped multi-head self-attention mechanisms with window-based local attention and cascaded fusion of multi-scale features over different scales. This architecture allows for the effective handling of features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to perform tasks such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more with low-resolution images. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in these areas with fewer parameters, showcasing its potential for broad application in real-world scenarios where capturing high-resolution images is not feasible.

The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available, and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed, the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE-RAS 24th International Conference on Humanoid Robots, Sep 2025, Seoul (Korea), South Korea</p></details> |
| **[HyperDiff: Hypergraph Guided Diffusion Model for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14431v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process. Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty, alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learnable SMPLify: A Neural Solution for Optimization-Free Human Pose Inverse Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13562v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space. Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify, generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/Learnable-SMPLify.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refinement Module based on Parse Graph for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11069v7)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parse graphs have been widely used in human pose estimation (HPE) to model the hierarchical structure and context relations of the human body, which has been shown to effectively improve robustness and accuracy. But most methods rely on parse graphs built from predefined skeletons, causing two key issues: poor integratability with other models, and complex designs with redundant parameters for hierarchy and context relation modeling of body. To address these issues, we propose a novel Refinement Module based on Parse Graph (RMPG). RMPG abandons skeleton connections and refines features by building implicit hierarchical structures and context relations between sub-feature maps, with strong integratability. Furthermore, our hierarchical network design demonstrates that RMPG can model the body's hierarchical structure and context relations with a simpler architecture and fewer parameters. RMPG operates in two stages: the top-down decomposition recursively partitions the feature map into a tree-structured hierarchy, where each node corresponds to a sub-feature map; the bottom-up composition aggregates context information to progressively refine the feature representation. Extensive experiments show that RMPG can be flexibly embedded into various methods, including our hierarchical networks, and consistently improves performance across multiple mainstream HPE benchmarks. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable Diffusion-Based Approach for Human De-Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12663v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can infer the missing parts of an occluded object by leveraging prior knowledge and visible cues. However, enabling deep learning models to accurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task. De-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions. The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as 2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | MM 2025 |

To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly improves generalization performance without requiring additional data collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models (e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures. Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$, while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under review</p></details> |
| **[A Coarse-to-Fine Human Pose Estimation Method based on Two-stage Distillation and Progressive Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11212v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation. However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model. The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is more significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient High-Resolution Visual Representation Learning with State Space Model for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03174v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing long-range dependencies while preserving high-resolution visual representations is crucial for dense prediction tasks such as human pose estimation. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced global modeling through self-attention but suffer from quadratic computational complexity with respect to token count, limiting their efficiency and scalability to high-resolution inputs, especially on mobile and resource-constrained devices. State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, offer an efficient alternative by combining global receptive fields with linear computational complexity, enabling scalable and resource-friendly sequence modeling. However, when applied to dense prediction tasks, existing visual SSMs face key limitations: weak spatial inductive bias, long-range forgetting from hidden state decay, and low-resolution outputs that hinder fine-grained localization. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Visual State Space (DVSS) block, which augments visual state space models with multi-scale convolutional operations to enhance local spatial representations and strengthen spatial inductive biases. Through architectural exploration and theoretical analysis, we incorporate deformable operation into the DVSS block, identifying it as an efficient and effective mechanism to enhance semantic aggregation and mitigate long-range forgetting via input-dependent, adaptive spatial sampling. We embed DVSS into a multi-branch high-resolution architecture to build HRVMamba, a novel model for efficient high-resolution representation learning. Extensive experiments on human pose estimation, image classification, and semantic segmentation show that HRVMamba performs competitively against leading CNN-, ViT-, and SSM-based baselines.

| **[eMamba: Efficient Acceleration Framework for Mamba Models in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10370v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$ fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm technology.

| **[ProbRadarM3F: mmWave Radar based Human Skeletal Pose Estimation with Probability Map Guided Multi-Format Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05164v5)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is a non-intrusive privacy and relatively convenient and inexpensive device, which has been demonstrated to be applicable in place of RGB cameras in human indoor pose estimation tasks. However, mmWave radar relies on the collection of reflected signals from the target, and the radar signals containing information is difficult to be fully applied. This has been a long-standing hindrance to the improvement of pose estimation accuracy. To address this major challenge, this paper introduces a probability map guided multi-format feature fusion model, ProbRadarM3F. This is a novel radar feature extraction framework using a traditional FFT method in parallel with a probability map based positional encoding method. ProbRadarM3F fuses the traditional heatmap features and the positional features, then effectively achieves the estimation of 14 keypoints of the human body. Experimental evaluation on the HuPR dataset proves the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper, outperforming other methods experimented on this dataset with an AP of 69.9 %. The emphasis of our study is focusing on the position information that is not exploited before in radar singal. This provides direction to investigate other potential non-redundant information from mmWave rader.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present Garment Inertial Poser (GaIP), a method for estimating full-body poses from sparse and loosely attached IMU sensors. We first simulate IMU recordings using an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. Our transformer-based diffusion models synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses from this challenging loose IMU data. We also demonstrate that incorporating garment-related parameters during training on loose IMU data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Our experiments show that our diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperform state-of-the-art inertial full-body pose estimators, both quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research on motion capture from such realistic sensor placements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[MultiFormer: A Multi-Person Pose Estimation System Based on CSI and Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22555v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation based on Channel State Information (CSI) has emerged as a promising approach for non-intrusive and precise human activity monitoring, yet faces challenges including accurate multi-person pose recognition and effective CSI feature learning. This paper presents MultiFormer, a wireless sensing system that accurately estimates human pose through CSI. The proposed system adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor with multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model inter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The extracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on on the public MM-Fi dataset and our self-collected dataset show that the MultiFormer achieves higher accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, especially for high-mobility keypoints (wrists, elbows) that are particularly difficult for previous methods to accurately estimate.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffPose-Animal: A Language-Conditioned Diffusion Framework for Animal Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08783v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.</p></details> | 13pages,2figures |
| **[StarPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial-Temporal Autoregressive Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02056v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

| **[VOccl3D: A Video Benchmark Dataset for 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation under real Occlusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06757v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied, with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g., most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques, incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions, offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets.

| **[RadProPoser: A Framework for Human Pose Estimation with Uncertainty Quantification from Raw Radar Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03578v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving, illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy, multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26 three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals, with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021. As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification, resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.</p></details> |  |

We develop the complete pipeline for a single vision sensor based multi-pedestrian detection and tracking, pose estimation, and monocular depth perception. Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance, even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements, including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7% improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware and inclusive robot behaviour.</p></details> |  |
| **[BaroPoser: Real-time Human Motion Tracking from IMUs and Barometers in Everyday Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03313v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |

Additionally, innovative breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1) Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2) Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation technology.</p></details> | 10 pages, 20 figures |
| **[IMUCoCo: Enabling Flexible On-Body IMU Placement for Human Pose Estimation and Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01894v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IMUs are regularly used to sense human motion, recognize activities, and estimate full-body pose. Users are typically required to place sensors in predefined locations that are often dictated by common wearable form factors and the machine learning model's training process. Consequently, despite the increasing number of everyday devices equipped with IMUs, the limited adaptability has seriously constrained the user experience to only using a few well-explored device placements (e.g., wrist and ears). In this paper, we rethink IMU-based motion sensing by acknowledging that signals can be captured from any point on the human body. We introduce IMU over Continuous Coordinates (IMUCoCo), a novel framework that maps signals from a variable number of IMUs placed on the body surface into a unified feature space based on their spatial coordinates. These features can be plugged into downstream models for pose estimation and activity recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that IMUCoCo supports accurate pose estimation in a wide range of typical and atypical sensor placements. Overall, IMUCoCo supports significantly more flexible use of IMUs for motion sensing than the state-of-the-art, allowing users to place their sensors-laden devices according to their needs and preferences. The framework also supports the ability to change device locations depending on the context and suggests placement depending on the use case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection, Pose Estimation and Segmentation for Multiple Bodies: Closing the Virtuous Circle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01562v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation methods work well on isolated people but struggle with multiple-bodies-in-proximity scenarios. Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models.

| **[Mitigating Resolution-Drift in Federated Learning: Case of Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23461v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks. However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs (teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks that rely on preserving spatial detail.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Sharp to Blur: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for 2D Human Pose Estimation Under Extreme Motion Blur Using Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22438v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation, sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation, we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations. Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain adaptation in real-world motion blur environments.

| **[KASportsFormer: Kinematic Anatomy Enhanced Transformer for 3D Human Pose Estimation on Short Sports Scene Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20763v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts. Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser (LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/jw0r1n/KASportsFormer</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Testing-Time Optimization for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02339v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although data-driven methods have achieved success in 3D human pose estimation, they often suffer from domain gaps and exhibit limited generalization. In contrast, optimization-based methods excel in fine-tuning for specific cases but are generally inferior to data-driven methods in overall performance. We observe that previous optimization-based methods commonly rely on a projection constraint, which only ensures alignment in 2D space, potentially leading to the overfitting problem. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware testing-time Optimization (UAO) framework, which keeps the prior information of the pre-trained model and alleviates the overfitting problem using the uncertainty of joints. Specifically, during the training phase, we design an effective 2D-to-3D network for estimating the corresponding 3D pose while quantifying the uncertainty of each 3D joint. For optimization during testing, the proposed optimization framework freezes the pre-trained model and optimizes only a latent state. Projection loss is then employed to ensure the generated poses are well aligned in 2D space for high-quality optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the uncertainty of each joint to determine how much each joint is allowed for optimization. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework are validated through extensive experiments on challenging datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. Notably, our approach outperforms the previous best result by a large margin of 5.5\% on Human3.6M.

| **[A Structure-aware and Motion-adaptive Framework for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19852v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically, SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

Since calibrating multiple cameras and finding matches across their views are inherently interdependent, performing both in a unified framework poses a significant challenge. We address these issues as a single registration problem of matching two sets of 3D points, leveraging human motion in dynamic multi-person scenes. To this end, we utilize 3D human poses obtained from an off-the-shelf monocular 3D human pose estimator and transform them into 3D points on a unit sphere, to solve the rotation, time offset, and the association alternatingly. We employ a probabilistic approach that can jointly solve both problems of aligning spatiotemporal data and establishing correspondences through soft assignment between two views. The translation is determined by applying coplanarity constraints. The pairwise registration results are integrated into a multiview setup, and then a nonlinear optimization method is used to improve the accuracy of the camera poses, temporal offsets, and multi-person associations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method as a practical marker-free calibration tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Physics-based Human Pose Estimation from a Single Moving RGB Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17406v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods, while achieving state-of-the-art results, suffer from artifacts when the scene does not have a strictly flat ground plane or when the camera is moving. Moreover, these methods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without ground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry changes. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first non-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a dynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion with human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a physics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints for more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat scenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to obtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera trajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then refine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer. From our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle with this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar environments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses in world coordinates.</p></details> |  |

This ''data gap'' is a key challenge both for building intelligent artificial systems and for understanding human development. Egocentric video capturing children's experience--their ''training data''--is a key ingredient for comparison of humans and models and for the development of algorithmic innovations to bridge this gap. Yet there are few such datasets available, and extant data are low-resolution, have limited metadata, and importantly, represent only a small set of children's experiences. Here, we provide the first release of a large developmental egocentric video dataset--the BabyView dataset--recorded using a high-resolution camera with a large vertical field-of-view and gyroscope/accelerometer data. This 868 hour dataset includes egocentric videos from children spanning 6 months to 3 years of age in longitudinal, at-home contexts. We provide gold-standard annotations for the evaluation of speech transcription, speaker diarization, and human pose estimation, and evaluate models in each of these domains. We train self-supervised language and vision models and evaluate their transfer to out-of-distribution tasks, including syntactic structure learning, object recognition, depth estimation, and image segmentation. Although performance in each domain scales with dataset size, overall performance is relatively lower than when models are trained on curated datasets, especially in the visual domain. Our dataset stands as an open challenge for robust, human-like AI systems: how can such systems achieve human-levels of success on the same scale and distribution of training data as humans?</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables and Appendix.

While the airports are more likely to become hotspots for potential conflicts to break out which can cause serious delays to flights and several safety issues. An intelligent algorithm which renders security surveillance more effective in detecting conflicts would bring many benefits to the passengers in terms of their safety, finance, and travelling efficiency. This paper details the development of a machine learning model to classify conflicting behaviour in a crowd. HRNet is used to segment the images and then two approaches are taken to classify the poses of people in the frame via multiple classifiers. Among them, it was found that the support vector machine (SVM) achieved the most performant achieving precision of 94.37%. Where the model falls short is against ambiguous behaviour such as a hug or losing track of a subject in the frame. The resulting model has potential for deployment within an airport if improvements are made to cope with the vast number of potential passengers in view as well as training against further ambiguous behaviours which will arise in an airport setting. In turn, will provide the capability to enhance security surveillance and improve airport safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>One o...</summary><p>One of the authors has expressed privacy concerns and made a related request</p></details> |

Its place in art reflects its growing applications in industry, such as robotics. However, those interactions often remains too technical and machine-driven for people to really engage into. On the artistic side, new technologies are often not explored in their full potential and lag a bit behind, so that state-of-the-art research does not make its way up to museums and exhibitions.

While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE ICRA 2025 (workshop: Enhancing Human Mobility: From Computer Vision-Based Motion Tracking to Wearable Assistive Robot Control), May 2025, Atlanta (Georgia), United States</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Calisthenics Skills Classification through Foreground Instance Selection and Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12292v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Calisthenics skill classification is the computer vision task of inferring the skill performed by an athlete from images, enabling automatic performance assessment and personalized analytics. Traditional methods for calisthenics skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods, achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, In International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing</p></details> |

Their low-latency and high dynamic range allow for improved response time in safety-critical situations caused by distracted walking or other unusual movements. However, the availability of data covering such scenarios remains limited. To address this gap, we present SEPose -- a comprehensive synthetic event-based human pose estimation dataset for fixed pedestrian perception generated using dynamic vision sensors in the CARLA simulator. With nearly 350K annotated pedestrians with body pose keypoints from the perspective of fixed traffic cameras, SEPose is a comprehensive synthetic multi-person pose estimation dataset that spans busy and light crowds and traffic across diverse lighting and weather conditions in 4-way intersections in urban, suburban, and rural environments.

While HAR has been extensively studied, action summarization using Wi-Fi and IMU signals in smart-home environments , which involves identifying and summarizing continuous actions, remains an emerging task. This paper introduces the novel XRF V2 dataset, designed for indoor daily activity Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and action summarization. XRF V2 integrates multimodal data from Wi-Fi signals, IMU sensors (smartphones, smartwatches, headphones, and smart glasses), and synchronized video recordings, offering a diverse collection of indoor activities from 16 volunteers across three distinct environments. To tackle TAL and action summarization, we propose the XRFMamba neural network, which excels at capturing long-term dependencies in untrimmed sensory sequences and achieves the best performance with an average mAP of 78.74, outperforming the recent WiFiTAD by 5.49 points in mAP@avg while using 35% fewer parameters. In action summarization, we introduce a new metric, Response Meaning Consistency (RMC), to evaluate action summarization performance. And it achieves an average Response Meaning Consistency (mRMC) of 0.802. We envision XRF V2 as a valuable resource for advancing research in human action localization, action forecasting, pose estimation, multimodal foundation models pre-training, synthetic data generation, and more.

| **[Joint angle model based learning to refine kinematic human pose estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11075v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet. Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProGait: A Multi-Purpose Video Dataset and Benchmark for Transfemoral Prosthesis Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10223v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis, due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait, to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset. We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models, demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for prosthesis-specific tasks.

This paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints. To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric, outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset. Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks.

| **[PoseLLM: Enhancing Language-Guided Human Pose Estimation with MLP Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09139v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation, enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions. Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in language-guided pose estimation.

While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%. We also validate the kinematic accuracy of monocular pose estimations through waveform analysis, highlighting strong correlations in joint angle estimations but limitations in velocity estimation. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of monocular pose estimation models in the context of sports, contributing valuable insights for advancing monocular pose estimation techniques in high-performance sports environments.

Our method integrates robust multi-view 2D pose tracking via a transformer-based top-down approach, employing epipolar geometry constraints and long-term video object segmentation for consistent identity tracking across views. Initial 3D poses are obtained through weighted triangulation and spline smoothing, followed by kinematic optimization to refine pose accuracy. We further enhance pose realism and robustness by introducing a multi-person physics-based trajectory optimization step, effectively addressing challenges such as rapid motions, occlusions, and close interactions. Experimental results on diverse datasets, including a new benchmark of elite boxing footage, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we release comprehensive annotated video datasets to advance future research in multi-person pose estimation for combat sports.</p></details> |  |
| **[mmEgoHand: Egocentric Hand Pose Estimation and Gesture Recognition with Head-mounted Millimeter-wave Radar and IMU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13805v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar have demonstrated its potential for human action recognition and pose estimation, offering privacy-preserving advantages over conventional cameras while maintaining occlusion robustness, with promising applications in human-computer interaction and wellness care. However, existing mmWave systems typically employ fixed-position configurations, restricting user mobility to predefined zones and limiting practical deployment scenarios. We introduce mmEgoHand, a head-mounted egocentric system for hand pose estimation to support applications such as gesture recognition, VR interaction, skill digitization and assessment, and robotic teleoperation. mmEgoHand synergistically integrates mmWave radar with inertial measurement units (IMUs) to enable dynamic perception. The IMUs actively compensate for radar interference induced by head movements, while our novel end-to-end Transformer architecture simultaneously estimates 3D hand keypoint coordinates through multi-modal sensor fusion. This dual-modality framework achieves spatial-temporal alignment of mmWave heatmaps with IMUs, overcoming viewpoint instability inherent in egocentric sensing scenarios. We further demonstrate that intermediate hand pose representations substantially improve performance in downstream task, e.g., VR gesture recognition. Extensive evaluations with 10 subjects performing 8 gestures across 3 distinct postures -- standing, sitting, lying -- achieve 90.8% recognition accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by a large margin.

In this paper, we propose Sparse Correlation and Joint Distillation (SCJD), a novel framework that balances efficiency and accuracy for 3D HPE. SCJD introduces Sparse Correlation Input Sequence Downsampling to reduce redundancy in student network inputs while preserving inter-frame correlations. For effective knowledge transfer, we propose Dynamic Joint Spatial Attention Distillation, which includes Dynamic Joint Embedding Distillation to enhance the student's feature representation using the teacher's multi-frame context feature, and Adjacent Joint Attention Distillation to improve the student network's focus on adjacent joint relationships for better spatial understanding. Additionally, Temporal Consistency Distillation aligns the temporal correlations between teacher and student networks through upsampling and global supervision.

| **[Reconstructing Close Human Interaction with Appearance and Proxemics Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02565v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.

Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the gait parameters of athletes.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent noise in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g., 30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation. Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts. Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted in IROS25, Hangzhou, China</p></details> |

This paper presents a test environment that combines a Vehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the feasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and vehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian localization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach through a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations of VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a commercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is generated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and projected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation technique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle perception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP domains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in movement trajectories and joint estimation stability. The validation includes dynamic test scenarios where human avatars, both walking and cycling, are monitored under controlled conditions. Our results show a strong alignment in HPE between RW and CP test conditions for stable motion patterns, while notable inaccuracies persist under dynamic movements and occlusions, particularly for complex cyclist postures. These findings contribute to refining CP testing approaches for evaluating next-generation AI-based vehicle perception and to enhancing interaction models of automated vehicles and VRUs in CP environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Preprint for 2025 IEEE IAVVC (International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference)</p></details> |
| **[Disentangled Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04444v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based methods for monocular 3D human pose estimation have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance by directly regressing the 3D joint coordinates from the 2D pose sequence. Although some methods decompose the task into bone length and bone direction prediction based on the human anatomical skeleton to explicitly incorporate more human body prior constraints, the performance of these methods is significantly lower than that of the SOTA diffusion-based methods. This can be attributed to the tree structure of the human skeleton. Direct application of the disentangled method could amplify the accumulation of hierarchical errors, propagating through each hierarchy. Meanwhile, the hierarchical information has not been fully explored by the previous methods. To address these problems, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser is proposed, termed DDHPose. In our approach: (1) We disentangle the 3D pose and diffuse the bone length and bone direction during the forward process of the diffusion model to effectively model the human pose prior. A disentanglement loss is proposed to supervise diffusion model learning. (2) For the reverse process, we propose Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser (HSTDenoiser) to improve the hierarchical modeling of each joint. Our HSTDenoiser comprises two components: the Hierarchical-Related Spatial Transformer (HRST) and the Hierarchical-Related Temporal Transformer (HRTT). HRST exploits joint spatial information and the influence of the parent joint on each joint for spatial modeling, while HRTT utilizes information from both the joint and its hierarchical adjacent joints to explore the hierarchical temporal correlations among joints.

These segmented frames are then processed by two existing models: one for Human Pose Estimation to obtain player skeletal joints, and the other for shuttlecock trajectory detection to extract shuttlecock trajectories. Leveraging these joints, trajectories, and player positions as inputs, we propose Badminton Stroke-type Transformer (BST) to classify player stroke-types in singles. To the best of our knowledge, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the largest publicly available badminton video dataset, ShuttleSet, which shows that effectively leveraging ball trajectory is likely to be a trend for racket sports action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (excluding references)</p></details> |

Advancements in neural networks have significantly alleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports broadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it depends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive game analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match recordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to identify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's flying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying on human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or unavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration method capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted an existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to accurately track player movements. Together, these contributions enable the full 3D reconstruction of a table tennis rally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVSport 2025</p></details> |

However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups, ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at: https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/fishnchips</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2025</p></details> |

Conventional methods either assume high-quality inputs or employ computationally expensive cascaded processing, which limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose STAR-Pose, a spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework specifically designed for video-based human pose estimation. Our method features a novel spatial-temporal Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention, which efficiently captures long-range temporal dependencies. Moreover, it is complemented by an adaptive fusion module that integrates parallel CNN branch for local texture enhancement. We also design a pose-aware compound loss to achieve task-oriented super-resolution. This loss guides the network to reconstruct structural features that are most beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than optimizing purely for visual quality. Extensive experiments on several mainstream video HPE datasets demonstrate that STAR-Pose outperforms existing approaches. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely low-resolution (64x48) conditions while delivering 2.8x to 4.4x faster inference than cascaded approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>14pag...</summary><p>14pages 3figures, alredy submiss to PRCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Audio and Pose: A General-Purpose Framework for Video Synchronization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15937v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video synchronization-aligning multiple video streams capturing the same event from different angles-is crucial for applications such as reality TV show production, sports analysis, surveillance, and autonomous systems. Prior work has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human, multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline, leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions. Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods, identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[PoseGRAF: Geometric-Reinforced Adaptive Fusion for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14596v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing monocular 3D pose estimation methods primarily rely on joint positional features, while overlooking intrinsic directional and angular correlations within the skeleton. As a result, they often produce implausible poses under joint occlusions or rapid motion changes. To address these challenges, we propose the PoseGRAF framework. We first construct a dual graph convolutional structure that separately processes joint and bone graphs, effectively capturing their local dependencies. A Cross-Attention module is then introduced to model interdependencies between bone directions and joint features. Building upon this, a dynamic fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate both feature types by leveraging the relational dependencies between joints and bones. An improved Transformer encoder is further incorporated in a residual manner to generate the final output. Experimental results on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches. Additional evaluations on in-the-wild videos further validate its generalizability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/iCityLab/PoseGRAF.</p></details> |  |

However, recent progress on multi-order game-theoretic interaction within deep neural networks (DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where the expressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increased kernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modern ConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning in pure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs. MogaNet encapsulates conceptually simple yet effective convolutions and gated aggregation into a compact module, where discriminative features are efficiently gathered and contextualized adaptively. MogaNet exhibits great scalability, impressive efficiency of parameters, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ViTs and ConvNets on ImageNet and various downstream vision benchmarks, including COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, 2D&3D human pose estimation, and video prediction. Notably, MogaNet hits 80.0% and 87.8% accuracy with 5.2M and 181M parameters on ImageNet-1K, outperforming ParC-Net and ConvNeXt-L, while saving 59% FLOPs and 17M parameters, respectively.

Accurate and efficient solutions are required for several real-world applications including animation, human-robot interaction, surveillance, and sports. However, challenges such as occlusions, 2D pose mismatches, random camera perspectives, and limited 3D labelled data have been hampering the models' performance and limiting their deployment in real-world scenarios. The higher availability of cameras has led researchers to explore multi-view solutions to take advantage of the different perspectives to reconstruct the pose. Most existing reviews have mainly focused on monocular 3D human pose estimation, so a comprehensive survey on multi-view approaches has been missing since 2012. According to the reviewed articles, the majority of the existing methods are fully-supervised approaches based on geometric constraints, which are often limited by 2D pose mismatches. To mitigate this, researchers have proposed incorporating temporal consistency or depth information. Alternatively, working directly with 3D features has been shown to completely overcome this issue, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity. Additionally, models with lower levels of supervision have been identified to help address challenges such as annotated data scarcity and generalisation to new setups. Therefore, no method currently addresses all challenges associated with 3D pose reconstruction, and a trade-off between complexity and performance exists. Further research is needed to develop approaches capable of quickly inferring a highly accurate 3D pose with bearable computation cost. Techniques such as active learning, low-supervision methods, temporal consistency, view selection, depth information estimation, and multi-modal approaches are strategies to consider when developing a new method for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 tables, 6 figures, accepted at Image and Vision Computing (IMAVIS)</p></details> |

However, accurate human joint estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda) Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation, window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error. This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose, with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, this process relies on human demonstrations captured through pose estimation or motion capture systems. In this paper, we explore a text-driven approach to mapping human motion to humanoids. To address the inherent discrepancies between the generated motion representations and the kinematic constraints of humanoid robots, we propose an angle signal network based on norm-position and rotation loss (NPR Loss). It generates joint angles, which serve as inputs to a reinforcement learning-based whole-body joint motion control policy. The policy ensures tracking of the generated motions while maintaining the robot's stability during execution. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, successfully transferring text-driven human motion to a real humanoid robot NAO.</p></details> |  |
| **[LGM-Pose: A Lightweight Global Modeling Network for Real-time Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04561v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Turn: At Home Turning Angle Estimation for Parkinson's Disease Severity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08182v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses. Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on free-living home settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.</p></details> |  |

Our work builds upon state-of-the-art advances in the area of human pose estimation, graph-attention neural networks, and transformer interpretablity. The downstream task is to assist rehabilitation by providing informative feedback to users while they are performing prescribed exercises. We utilize a contrastive learning strategy during training. Given a tuple of correctly and incorrectly executed exercises, our model is able to identify and highlight those joints that are involved in an incorrect movement and thus require the user's attention. We collected an in-house dataset, ExeCheck, with paired recordings of both correct and incorrect execution of exercises. In our experiments, we tested our method on this dataset as well as the UI-PRMD dataset and found ExeCheck outperformed the baseline method using pairwise sequence alignment in identifying joints of physical relevance in rehabilitation exercises.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Pyramid-structured Long-range Dependencies for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02853v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial constraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA) module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

| **[Benchmarking 3D Human Pose Estimation Models under Occlusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10350v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Pose Estimation (HPE) involves detecting and localizing keypoints on the human body from visual data. In 3D HPE, occlusions, where parts of the body are not visible in the image, pose a significant challenge for accurate pose reconstruction. This paper presents a benchmark on the robustness of 3D HPE models under realistic occlusion conditions, involving combinations of occluded keypoints commonly observed in real-world scenarios. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D HPE models, spanning convolutional, transformer-based, graph-based, and diffusion-based architectures, using the BlendMimic3D dataset, a synthetic dataset with ground-truth 2D/3D annotations and occlusion labels. All models were originally trained on Human3.6M and tested here without retraining to assess their generalization. We introduce a protocol that simulates occlusion by adding noise into 2D keypoints based on real detector behavior, and conduct both global and per-joint sensitivity analyses. Our findings reveal that all models exhibit notable performance degradation under occlusion, with diffusion-based models underperforming despite their stochastic nature. Additionally, a per-joint occlusion analysis identifies consistent vulnerability in distal joints (e.g., wrists, feet) across models. Overall, this work highlights critical limitations of current 3D HPE models in handling occlusions, and provides insights for improving real-world robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improvement of human health lifespan with hybrid group pose estimation methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03169v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human beings rely heavily on estimation of poses in order to access their body movements. Human pose estimation methods take advantage of computer vision advances in order to track human body movements in real life applications. This comes from videos which are recorded through available devices. These para-digms provide potential to make human movement measurement more accessible to users. The consumers of pose estimation movements believe that human poses content tend to supplement available videos. This has increased pose estimation software usage to estimate human poses. In order to address this problem, we develop hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method to improve human health. This proposed hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method aims to detect multi-person poses using modified group pose estimation and modified real time pose estimation. This ensemble allows fusion of performance of stated methods in real time. The input poses from images are fed into individual meth-ods. The pose transformation method helps to identify relevant features for en-semble to perform training effectively. After this, customized pre-trained hybrid ensemble is trained on public benchmarked datasets which is being evaluated through test datasets. The effectiveness and viability of proposed method is estab-lished based on comparative analysis of group pose estimation methods and ex-periments conducted on benchmarked datasets. It provides best optimized results in real-time pose estimation. It makes pose estimation method more robust to oc-clusion and improves dense regression accuracy. These results have affirmed po-tential application of this method in several real-time situations with improvement in human health life span</p></details> |  |

For the task of test-time adaptation, the misalignment manifests as overly smoothed and unguided predictions. The smoothing settles predictions towards some average pose. Furthermore, when there are occlusions or truncations, the adaptation becomes fully unguided. To this end, we pioneer the integration of a semantics-aware motion prior for the test-time adaptation of 3D pose estimation. We leverage video understanding and a well-structured motion-text space to adapt the model motion prediction to adhere to video semantics during test time. Additionally, we incorporate a missing 2D pose completion based on the motion-text similarity. The pose completion strengthens the motion prior's guidance for occlusions and truncations. Our method significantly improves state-of-the-art 3D human pose estimation TTA techniques, with more than 12% decrease in PA-MPJPE on 3DPW and 3DHP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

However, many existing methods rely on RGB cameras and do not account for low-light environments or motion blur. Event-based cameras have the potential to address these challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel task of human pose estimation using a front-facing event-based camera mounted on the head and propose D-EventEgo, the first framework for this task. The proposed method first estimates the head poses, and then these are used as conditions to generate body poses. However, when estimating head poses, the presence of dynamic objects mixed with background events may reduce head pose estimation accuracy. Therefore, we introduce the Motion Segmentation Module to remove dynamic objects and extract background information. Extensive experiments on our synthetic event-based dataset derived from EgoBody, demonstrate that our approach outperforms our baseline in four out of five evaluation metrics in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICIP 2025, Project Page: https://wataru823.github.io/D-EventEgo/</p></details> |
| **[Spectral Compression Transformer with Line Pose Graph for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21309v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based 3D human pose estimation methods suffer from high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length. Additionally, pose sequences often contain significant redundancy between frames. However, recent methods typically fail to improve model capacity while effectively eliminating sequence redundancy. In this work, we introduce the Spectral Compression Transformer (SCT) to reduce sequence length and accelerate computation. The SCT encoder treats hidden features between blocks as Temporal Feature Signals (TFS) and applies the Discrete Cosine Transform, a Fourier transform-based technique, to determine the spectral components to be retained. By filtering out certain high-frequency noise components, SCT compresses the sequence length and reduces redundancy. To further enrich the input sequence with prior structural information, we propose the Line Pose Graph (LPG) based on line graph theory. The LPG generates skeletal position information that complements the input 2D joint positions, thereby improving the model's performance. Finally, we design a dual-stream network architecture to effectively model spatial joint relationships and the compressed motion trajectory within the pose sequence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency. For example, on the Human3.6M dataset, our method achieves an MPJPE of 37.7mm while maintaining a low computational cost. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on each module to assess its effectiveness. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion for Monocular 3-D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20611v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods for 3-D human pose estimation face significant computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of self-attention mechanism complexity with sequence length. Recently, the Mamba model has substantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding performance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM). However, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3-D joint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution structure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To address these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in this paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction and length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing effective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint sequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba model by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling it to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a Spatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial relationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal topology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing human structural relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets for testing and comparison, and the results show that the proposed method greatly reduces computational cost while achieving higher accuracy. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptHMR: Promptable Human Mesh Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06397v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation presents challenges in diverse scenarios such as crowded scenes, person-person interactions, and single-view reconstruction. Existing approaches lack mechanisms to incorporate auxiliary "side information" that could enhance reconstruction accuracy in such challenging scenarios. Furthermore, the most accurate methods rely on cropped person detections and cannot exploit scene context while methods that process the whole image often fail to detect people and are less accurate than methods that use crops. While recent language-based methods explore HPS reasoning through large language or vision-language models, their metric accuracy is well below the state of the art. In contrast, we present PromptHMR, a transformer-based promptable method that reformulates HPS estimation through spatial and semantic prompts. Our method processes full images to maintain scene context and accepts multiple input modalities: spatial prompts like bounding boxes and masks, and semantic prompts like language descriptions or interaction labels. PromptHMR demonstrates robust performance across challenging scenarios: estimating people from bounding boxes as small as faces in crowded scenes, improving body shape estimation through language descriptions, modeling person-person interactions, and producing temporally coherent motions in videos. Experiments on benchmarks show that PromptHMR achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering flexible prompt-based control over the HPS estimation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

In traditional domains, \eg regression and classification, MDT typically relies on dataset merging or multi-head supervision. However, the diversity of skeleton types and limited cross-dataset supervision complicate integration in pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce PoseBH, a new MDT framework that tackles keypoint heterogeneity and limited supervision through two key techniques. First, we propose nonparametric keypoint prototypes that learn within a unified embedding space, enabling seamless integration across skeleton types. Second, we develop a cross-type self-supervision mechanism that aligns keypoint predictions with keypoint embedding prototypes, providing supervision without relying on teacher-student models or additional augmentations. PoseBH substantially improves generalization across whole-body and animal pose datasets, including COCO-WholeBody, AP-10K, and APT-36K, while preserving performance on standard human pose benchmarks (COCO, MPII, and AIC). Furthermore, our learned keypoint embeddings transfer effectively to hand shape estimation (InterHand2.6M) and human body shape estimation (3DPW).

While emerging technologies are making it easier to capture kinematics with biomechanical models, or how joint angles change over time, inferring the underlying physics that give rise to these movements, including ground reaction forces, joint torques, or even muscle activations, is still challenging. Here we explore whether imitation learning applied to a biomechanical model from a large dataset of movements from able-bodied and impaired individuals can learn to compute these inverse dynamics. Although imitation learning in human pose estimation has seen great interest in recent years, our work differences in several ways: we focus on using an accurate biomechanical model instead of models adopted for computer vision, we test it on a dataset that contains participants with impaired movements, we reported detailed tracking metrics relevant for the clinical measurement of movement including joint angles and ground contact events, and finally we apply imitation learning to a muscle-driven neuromusculoskeletal model. We show that our imitation learning policy, KinTwin, can accurately replicate the kinematics of a wide range of movements, including those with assistive devices or therapist assistance, and that it can infer clinically meaningful differences in joint torques and muscle activations. Our work demonstrates the potential for using imitation learning to enable high-quality movement analysis in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Keypoints as Dynamic Centroids for Unified Human Pose and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12130v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic movement of the human body presents a fundamental challenge for human pose estimation and body segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on combining keypoint heatmaps with segmentation masks but often struggle in scenarios involving overlapping joints or rapidly changing poses during instance-level segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose Keypoints as Dynamic Centroid (KDC), a new centroid-based representation for unified human pose estimation and instance-level segmentation. KDC adopts a bottom-up paradigm to generate keypoint heatmaps for both easily distinguishable and complex keypoints and improves keypoint detection and confidence scores by introducing KeyCentroids using a keypoint disk. It leverages high-confidence keypoints as dynamic centroids in the embedding space to generate MaskCentroids, allowing for swift clustering of pixels to specific human instances during rapid body movements in live environments. Our experimental evaluations on the CrowdPose, OCHuman, and COCO benchmarks demonstrate KDC's effectiveness and generalizability in challenging scenarios in terms of both accuracy and runtime performance.

However, most existing EHPS models focus primarily on minimizing estimation errors, with limited attention on potential security vulnerabilities. Current adversarial attacks on EHPS models often require white-box access (e.g., model details or gradients) or generate visually conspicuous perturbations, limiting their practicality and ability to expose real-world security threats. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Unnoticeable Black-Box Attack (UBA) against EHPS models. UBA leverages the latent-space representations of natural images to generate an optimal adversarial noise pattern and iteratively refine its attack potency along an optimized direction in digital space. Crucially, this process relies solely on querying the model's output, requiring no internal knowledge of the EHPS architecture, while guiding the noise optimization toward greater stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments and visual analyses demonstrate the superiority of UBA. Notably, UBA increases the pose estimation errors of EHPS models by 17.27%-58.21% on average, revealing critical vulnerabilities. These findings underscore the urgent need to address and mitigate security risks associated with digital human generation systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

In practice, however, systems must adapt to diverse viewpoints, environments, and camera setups -- conditions that differ significantly from those encountered during training, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we present a standardized testing environment in which each method is evaluated on a variety of datasets, ensuring consistent and fair cross-dataset comparisons -- allowing for the analysis of methods on previously unseen data. Therefore, we propose PoseBench3D, a unified framework designed to systematically re-evaluate prior and future models across four of the most widely used datasets for human pose estimation -- with the framework able to support novel and future datasets as the field progresses. Through a unified interface, our framework provides datasets in a pre-configured yet easily modifiable format, ensuring compatibility with diverse model architectures. We re-evaluated the work of 18 methods, either trained or gathered from existing literature, and reported results using both Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and Procrustes Aligned Mean Per Joint Position Error (PA-MPJPE) metrics, yielding more than 100 novel cross-dataset evaluation results. Additionally, we analyze performance differences resulting from various pre-processing techniques and dataset preparation parameters -- offering further insight into model generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/bryanjvela/PoseLab3D/tree/submission_branch</p></details> |
| **[Pose Priors from Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03689v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language is often used to describe physical interaction, yet most 3D human pose estimation methods overlook this rich source of information. We bridge this gap by leveraging large multimodal models (LMMs) as priors for reconstructing contact poses, offering a scalable alternative to traditional methods that rely on human annotations or motion capture data. Our approach extracts contact-relevant descriptors from an LMM and translates them into tractable losses to constrain 3D human pose optimization. Despite its simplicity, our method produces compelling reconstructions for both two-person interactions and self-contact scenarios, accurately capturing the semantics of physical and social interactions. Our results demonstrate that LMMs can serve as powerful tools for contact prediction and pose estimation, offering an alternative to costly manual human annotations or motion capture data.

| **[Optimal-state Dynamics Estimation for Physics-based Human Motion Capture from Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07795v4)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion capture from monocular videos has made significant progress in recent years. However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g. in form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically plausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces and exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current state-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict torques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e. the joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical models, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end, we propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with the kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural Kalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to predict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a physics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to realize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and simulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show that this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps balancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important for not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing physically plausible human poses. The proposed approach excels in the physics-based human pose estimation task and demonstrates the physical plausibility of the predictive dynamics, compared to state of the art.

| **[UMotion: Uncertainty-driven Human Motion Estimation from Inertial and Ultra-wideband Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09393v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) have gained popularity for estimating 3D human motion. However, challenges such as pose ambiguity, data drift, and limited adaptability to diverse bodies persist. To address these issues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state estimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six integrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB sensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in resolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with anthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors are affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor data and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF iteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain human motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over state of the art in pose accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

We focus on four-way sleep position classification using data collected from a PSM placed under a mattress in a sleep clinic. Sleep positions can affect sleep quality and the prevalence of sleep disorders, such as apnea. Measurements were performed on patients with suspected sleep disorders referred for assessments at a sleep clinic. Training deep learning models can be challenging in clinical settings due to the need for large amounts of labeled data. To overcome the shortage of labeled training data, we utilize transfer learning to adapt pre-trained deep learning models to accurately estimate sleep positions from a low-resolution PSM dataset collected in a polysomnography sleep lab. Our approach leverages Vision Transformer models pre-trained on ImageNet using masked autoencoding (ViTMAE) and a pre-trained model for human pose estimation (ViTPose). These approaches outperform previous work from PSM-based sleep pose classification using deep learning (TCN) as well as traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) that use engineered features. We evaluate the performance of sleep position classification from 112 nights of patient recordings and validate it on a higher resolution 13-patient dataset. Despite the challenges of differentiating between sleep positions from low-resolution PSM data, our approach shows promise for real-world deployment in clinical settings</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference publication submitted to IEEE I2MTC 2025</p></details> |

Ergonomic assessments can mitigate these risks by identifying workplace adjustments that improve posture and reduce strain. Camera-based systems offer a non-intrusive, cost-effective method for continuous ergonomic tracking, but they also raise significant privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a privacy-aware ergonomic assessment framework utilizing machine learning techniques. Our approach employs adversarial training to develop a lightweight neural network that obfuscates video data, preserving only the essential information needed for human pose estimation. This obfuscation ensures compatibility with standard pose estimation algorithms, maintaining high accuracy while protecting privacy. The obfuscated video data is transmitted to a central server, where state-of-the-art keypoint detection algorithms extract body landmarks. Using multi-view integration, 3D keypoints are reconstructed and evaluated with the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) method. Our system provides a secure, effective solution for ergonomic monitoring in industrial environments, addressing both privacy and workplace safety concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 35th CIRP Design conference</p></details> |

Compared to vision-based systems, full-body pose estimation from sparse tracking signals is not limited by environmental conditions or recording range. However, previous works either face the challenge of wearing additional sensors on the pelvis and lower-body or rely on external visual sensors to obtain global positions of key joints. To improve the practicality of the technology for virtual reality applications, we estimate full-body poses using only inertial data obtained from three Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors worn on the head and wrists, thereby reducing the complexity of the hardware system. In this work, we propose a method called Progressive Inertial Poser (ProgIP) for human pose estimation, which combines neural network estimation with a human dynamics model, considers the hierarchical structure of the kinematic chain, and employs a multi-stage progressive network estimation with increased depth to reconstruct full-body motion in real time. The encoder combines Transformer Encoder and bidirectional LSTM (TE-biLSTM) to flexibly capture the temporal dependencies of the inertial sequence, while the decoder based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) transforms high-dimensional features and accurately projects them onto Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model parameters. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on multiple public datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the same inputs, and is comparable to recent works using six IMU sensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Views Are Better than One: Monocular 3D Pose Estimation with Multiview Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12421v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deducing a 3D human pose from a single 2D image is inherently challenging because multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D representation. 3D data can resolve this pose ambiguity, but it is expensive to record and requires an intricate setup that is often restricted to controlled lab environments. We propose a method that improves the performance of deep learning-based monocular 3D human pose estimation models by using multiview data only during training, but not during inference. We introduce a novel loss function, consistency loss, which operates on two synchronized views. This approach is simpler than previous models that require 3D ground truth or intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. Our consistency loss penalizes differences in two pose sequences after rigid alignment. We also demonstrate that our consistency loss substantially improves performance for fine-tuning without requiring 3D data. Furthermore, we show that using our consistency loss can yield state-of-the-art performance when training models from scratch in a semi-supervised manner. Our findings provide a simple way to capture new data, e.g in a new domain. This data can be added using off-the-shelf cameras with no calibration requirements. We make all our code and data publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, human global motions are still challenging to be reconstructed by IMUs. This paper aims to solve this problem by involving physics. It proposes a physical optimization scheme based on multiple contacts to enable physically plausible translation estimation in the full 3D space where the z-directional motion is usually challenging for previous works. It also considers gravity in local pose estimation which well constrains human global orientations and refines local pose estimation in a joint estimation manner. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate motion capture for both local poses and global motions. Furthermore, by deeply integrating physics, we can also estimate 3D contact, contact forces, joint torques, and interacting proxy surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025.

These developments have led to highly accurate body tracking systems, which have direct applications in sports analysis and performance evaluation. This work analyzes the performance of six trackers: two point trackers and four joint trackers for biomechanical analysis in sprints. The proposed framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames. The experimental framework employs forty sprints from five professional runners, focusing on three key angles in sprint biomechanics: trunk inclination, hip flex extension, and knee flex extension. We propose a post-processing module for outlier detection and fusion prediction in the joint angles. The experimental results demonstrate that using joint-based models yields root mean squared errors ranging from 11.41{\deg} to 4.37{\deg}. When integrated with the post-processing modules, these errors can be reduced to 6.99{\deg} and 3.88{\deg}, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that human pose tracking approaches can be valuable resources for the biomechanical analysis of running. However, there is still room for improvement in applications where high accuracy is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the paper presented to the Third Workshop on Learning with Few or Without Annotated Face, Body, and Gesture Data on 19th IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition 2025</p></details> |

HDiffTG leverages the strengths of these techniques to significantly improve pose estimation accuracy and robustness while maintaining a lightweight design. The Transformer captures global spatiotemporal dependencies, the GCN models local skeletal structures, and the diffusion model provides step-by-step optimization for fine-tuning, achieving a complementary balance between global and local features. This integration enhances the model's ability to handle pose estimation under occlusions and in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce lightweight optimizations to the integrated model and refine the objective function design to reduce computational overhead without compromising performance. Evaluation results on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that HDiffTG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset while excelling in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

| **[Polar Coordinate-Based 2D Pose Prior with Neural Distance Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03445v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose capture is essential for sports analysis, enabling precise evaluation of athletes' movements. While deep learning-based human pose estimation (HPE) models from RGB videos have achieved impressive performance on public datasets, their effectiveness in real-world sports scenarios is often hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts across different pose representations. Fine-tuning these models can partially alleviate such challenges but typically requires large-scale annotated data and still struggles to generalize across diverse sports environments. To address these limitations, we propose a 2D pose prior-guided refinement approach based on Neural Distance Fields (NDF). Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on angular representations of human poses, we introduce a polar coordinate-based representation that explicitly incorporates joint connection lengths, enabling a more accurate correction of erroneous pose estimations. Additionally, we define a novel non-geodesic distance metric that separates angular and radial discrepancies, which we demonstrate is better suited for polar representations than traditional geodesic distances. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a gradient-based batch-projection augmentation strategy, which synthesizes realistic pose samples through iterative refinement. Our method is evaluated on a long jump dataset, demonstrating its ability to improve 2D pose estimation across multiple pose representations, making it robust across different domains. Experimental results show that our approach enhances pose plausibility while requiring only limited training data.

Traditional regression-based methods assume fixed distributions, which might lead to poor UQ. Heatmap-based methods effectively model the output distribution using likelihood heatmaps, however, they demand significant resources. To address this, we propose Continuous Flow Residual Estimation (CFRE), an integration of Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) into regression-based models, which allows for dynamic distribution adaptation. Through extensive experiments, we show that CFRE leads to better accuracy and uncertainty quantification with retained computational efficiency on both 2D and 3D human pose estimation tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by SCIA2025 |

However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Each insole, fabricated with e-textile garment techniques, costs under USD 1, making it significantly cheaper than commercial alternatives and ideal for large-scale production. Our approach uses foot pressure distribution, acceleration, and rotation data to overcome limitations, providing a lightweight, minimally intrusive, and privacy-aware solution. The system employs a Transformer model for efficient temporal feature extraction, enriched by first and second derivatives in the input stream. Including multimodal information, such as accelerometers and rotational measurements, improves the accuracy of complex motion pattern recognition. These facts are demonstrated experimentally, while error metrics show the robustness of the approach in various posture estimation tasks. This work could be the foundation for a low-cost, practical application in rehabilitation, injury prevention, and health monitoring while enabling further development through sensor optimization and expanded datasets.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods mainly focus on directly establishing the correspondence between two models and then aggregating point-wise distance between corresponding points, resulting in them being either inefficient or ineffective. In this paper, we propose DDM, an efficient, effective, robust, and differentiable distance metric for 3D geometry data. Specifically, we construct DDM based on the proposed implicit representation of 3D models, namely directional distance field (DDF), which defines the directional distances of 3D points to a model to capture its local surface geometry. We then transfer the discrepancy between two 3D geometric models as the discrepancy between their DDFs defined on an identical domain, naturally establishing model correspondence. To demonstrate the advantage of our DDM, we explore various distance metric-driven 3D geometric modeling tasks, including template surface fitting, rigid registration, non-rigid registration, scene flow estimation and human pose optimization. Extensive experiments show that our DDM achieves significantly higher accuracy under all tasks. As a generic distance metric, DDM has the potential to advance the field of 3D geometric modeling.

This study focuses on dance style recognition using features extracted using Laban Movement Analysis. Previous studies for dance style recognition often focus on cross-frame movement analysis, which limits the ability to capture temporal context and dynamic transitions between movements. This gap highlights the need for a method that can add temporal context to LMA features. For this, we introduce a novel pipeline which combines 3D pose estimation, 3D human mesh reconstruction, and floor aware body modeling to effectively extract LMA features. To address the temporal limitation, we propose a sliding window approach that captures movement evolution across time in features. These features are then used to train various machine learning methods for classification, and their explainability explainable AI methods to evaluate the contribution of each feature to classification performance. Our proposed method achieves a highest classification accuracy of 99.18\% which shows that the addition of temporal context significantly improves dance style recognition performance.</p></details> |  |

Many challenges make the reconstruction difficult due to (1) actors occluding with each other and having diverse facial expressions, (2) cluttered stages, and (3) small baseline views or sudden shot changes. To address these issues, we present ShowMak3r, a comprehensive reconstruction pipeline that allows the editing of scenes like how video clips are made in a production control room. In ShowMak3r, a 3DLocator module locates recovered actors on the stage using depth prior and estimates unseen human poses via interpolation. The proposed ShotMatcher module then tracks the actors under shot changes. Furthermore, ShowMak3r introduces a face-fitting network that dynamically recovers the actors' expressions.

While existing research primarily focuses on reducing estimation errors, it largely neglects robustness and security aspects, leaving these systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To address this significant challenge, we propose the \textbf{Tangible Attack (TBA)}, a novel framework designed to generate adversarial examples capable of effectively compromising any digital human generation model. Our approach introduces a \textbf{Dual Heterogeneous Noise Generator (DHNG)}, which leverages Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and ControlNet to produce diverse, targeted noise tailored to the original image features. Additionally, we design a custom \textbf{adversarial loss function} to optimize the noise, ensuring both high controllability and potent disruption. By iteratively refining the adversarial sample through multi-gradient signals from both the noise and the state-of-the-art EHPS model, TBA substantially improves the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate TBA's superiority, achieving a remarkable 41.0\% increase in estimation error, with an average improvement of approximately 17.0\%. These findings expose significant security vulnerabilities in current EHPS models and highlight the need for stronger defenses in digital human generation systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

We propose a latent diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats, including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference. Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background, reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 11 pages; Supplementary materials: 7 pages</p></details> |
| **[Scale-GS: Efficient Scalable Gaussian Splatting via Redundancy-filtering Training on Streaming Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21444v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering, there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Generating Human-AI Collaborative Design Sequence for 3D Assets via Differentiable Operation Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17645v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of 3D artificial intelligence-generated content (3D-AIGC) has enabled rapid synthesis of intricate geometries. However, a fundamental disconnect persists between AI-generated content and human-centric design paradigms, rooted in representational incompatibilities: conventional AI frameworks predominantly manipulate meshes or neural representations (\emph{e.g.}, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting), while designers operate within parametric modeling tools. This disconnection diminishes the practical value of AI for 3D industry, undermining the efficiency of human-AI collaboration. To resolve this disparity, we focus on generating design operation sequences, which are structured modeling histories that comprehensively capture the step-by-step construction process of 3D assets and align with designers' typical workflows in modern 3D software. We first reformulate fundamental modeling operations (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Extrude}, \emph{Boolean}) into differentiable units, enabling joint optimization of continuous (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Extrude} height) and discrete (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Boolean} type) parameters via gradient-based learning. Based on these differentiable operations, a hierarchical graph with gating mechanism is constructed and optimized end-to-end by minimizing Chamfer Distance to target geometries. Multi-stage sequence length constraint and domain rule penalties enable unsupervised learning of compact design sequences without ground-truth sequence supervision. Extensive validation demonstrates that the generated operation sequences achieve high geometric fidelity, smooth mesh wiring, rational step composition and flexible editing capacity, with full compatibility within design industry.</p></details> |  |

In particular, recent advancements utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters, enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware, cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability.

| **[AvatarBack: Back-Head Generation for Complete 3D Avatars from Front-View Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20623v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training, effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric, photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realistic and Controllable 3D Gaussian-Guided Object Editing for Driving Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20471v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous. Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects. Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pseudo-Simulation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04218v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations ($R^2=0.8$) than the best existing open-loop approach ($R^2=0.7$). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation.

Our approach not only simulates the realistic visual artifacts produced by dual-fisheye cameras but also enables the synthesis of seamlessly rendered 360-degree images. By jointly optimizing 3D Gaussian parameters alongside calibration variables that emulate lens gaps and angular distortions, our framework transforms imperfect omnidirectional inputs into flawless novel view synthesis.

A common strategy involves learning a deformation field to model the temporal changes of a canonical set of 3D Gaussians. However, these deformation-based methods often produce blurred renderings and lose fine motion details in highly dynamic regions due to the inherent limitations of a single, unified model in representing diverse motion patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Motion-Aware Partitioning of Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (MAPo), a novel framework for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction. Its core is a dynamic score-based partitioning strategy that distinguishes between high- and low-dynamic 3D Gaussians. For high-dynamic 3D Gaussians, we recursively partition them temporally and duplicate their deformation networks for each new temporal segment, enabling specialized modeling to capture intricate motion details. Concurrently, low-dynamic 3DGs are treated as static to reduce computational costs. However, this temporal partitioning strategy for high-dynamic 3DGs can introduce visual discontinuities across frames at the partition boundaries. To address this, we introduce a cross-frame consistency loss, which not only ensures visual continuity but also further enhances rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAPo achieves superior rendering quality compared to baselines while maintaining comparable computational costs, particularly in regions with complex or rapid motions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, Anonymous AAAI Submission</p></details> |

We propose FastAvatar, a feedforward 3D avatar framework capable of flexibly leveraging diverse daily recordings (e.g., a single image, multi-view observations, or monocular video) to reconstruct a high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model within seconds, using only a single unified model. FastAvatar's core is a Large Gaussian Reconstruction Transformer featuring three key designs: First, a variant VGGT-style transformer architecture aggregating multi-frame cues while injecting initial 3D prompt to predict an aggregatable canonical 3DGS representation; Second, multi-granular guidance encoding (camera pose, FLAME expression, head pose) mitigating animation-induced misalignment for variable-length inputs; Third, incremental Gaussian aggregation via landmark tracking and sliced fusion losses. Integrating these features, FastAvatar enables incremental reconstruction, i.e., improving quality with more observations, unlike prior work wasting input data. This yields a quality-speed-tunable paradigm for highly usable avatar modeling. Extensive experiments show that FastAvatar has higher quality and highly competitive speed compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, 3DGS lacks 3D segmentation ability, which limits its applicability in tasks that require scene understanding. The identification and isolating of specific object components is crucial. To address this limitation, we propose Label-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (LabelGS), a method that augments the Gaussian representation with object label.LabelGS introduces cross-view consistent semantic masks for 3D Gaussians and employs a novel Occlusion Analysis Model to avoid overfitting occlusion during optimization, Main Gaussian Labeling model to lift 2D semantic prior to 3D Gaussian and Gaussian Projection Filter to avoid Gaussian label conflict. Our approach achieves effective decoupling of Gaussian representations and refines the 3DGS optimization process through a random region sampling strategy, significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LabelGS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, including Feature-3DGS, in the 3D scene segmentation task. Notably, LabelGS achieves a remarkable 22X speedup in training compared to Feature-3DGS, at a resolution of 1440X1080.

Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view rendering.

While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time optimization methods.

In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[MCGS: Multiview Consistency Enhancement for Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Radiance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11394v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiance fields represented by 3D Gaussians excel at synthesizing novel views, offering both high training efficiency and fast rendering. However, with sparse input views, the lack of multi-view consistency constraints results in poorly initialized Gaussians and unreliable heuristics for optimization, leading to suboptimal performance. Existing methods often incorporate depth priors from dense estimation networks but overlook the inherent multi-view consistency in input images. Additionally, they rely on dense initialization, which limits the efficiency of scene representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, named MCGS, enabling photorealistic scene reconstruction from sparse views. The key innovations of MCGS in enhancing multi-view consistency are as follows: i) We leverage matching priors from a sparse matcher to initialize Gaussians primarily on textured regions, while low-texture areas are populated with randomly distributed Gaussians. This yields a compact yet sufficient set of initial Gaussians. ii) We propose a multi-view consistency-guided progressive pruning strategy to dynamically eliminate inconsistent Gaussians. This approach confines their optimization to a consistency-constrained space, which ensures robust and coherent scene reconstruction. These strategies enhance robustness to sparse views, accelerate rendering, and reduce memory consumption, making MCGS a practical framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

However, all existing approaches still rely on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization. In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps. Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled crowdsourced data.

However, in sparse-view scenarios, despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians, i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians. The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model (EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior 3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.</p></details> |  |

To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions, ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting. Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning. TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore, despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

FastAvatar uses a novel encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face ``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures. Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion, model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g., FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in consumer and interactive systems.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Scene features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing 3DGS-based baselines.

| **[Camera Pose Refinement via 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17876v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks, requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing 3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches, achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.</p></details> |  |

However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage 2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction. Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks.

| **[Achieving Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Under Rényi Differential Privacy for Fair and Private Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21815v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tree-Guided Diffusion Planner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21800v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process: (1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on all tasks.

| **[OptMark: Robust Multi-bit Diffusion Watermarking via Inference Time Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21727v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking diffusion-generated images is crucial for copyright protection and user tracking. However, current diffusion watermarking methods face significant limitations: zero-bit watermarking systems lack the capacity for large-scale user tracking, while multi-bit methods are highly sensitive to certain image transformations or generative attacks, resulting in a lack of comprehensive robustness. In this paper, we propose OptMark, an optimization-based approach that embeds a robust multi-bit watermark into the intermediate latents of the diffusion denoising process. OptMark strategically inserts a structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and a detail watermark late to withstand image transformations, with tailored regularization terms to preserve image quality and ensure imperceptibility. To address the challenge of memory consumption growing linearly with the number of denoising steps during optimization, OptMark incorporates adjoint gradient methods, reducing memory usage from O(N) to O(1). Experimental results demonstrate that OptMark achieves invisible multi-bit watermarking while ensuring robust resilience against valuemetric transformations, geometric transformations, editing, and regeneration attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent and Invariant Generalization Learning for Short-video Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04061v3)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains (source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains (target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at https://github.com/ghh1125/DOCTOR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[FLORA: Efficient Synthetic Data Generation for Object Detection in Low-Data Regimes via finetuning Flux LoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21712v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks. Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on 5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to 21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Diffusion Modeling with Differential Privacy for Tabular Data Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16083v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for privacy-preserving data analytics in various domains necessitates solutions for synthetic data generation that rigorously uphold privacy standards. We introduce the DP-FedTabDiff framework, a novel integration of Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data. This framework ensures compliance with privacy regulations while maintaining data utility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-FedTabDiff on multiple real-world mixed-type tabular datasets, achieving significant improvements in privacy guarantees without compromising data quality. Our empirical evaluations reveal the optimal trade-offs between privacy budgets, client configurations, and federated optimization strategies. The results affirm the potential of DP-FedTabDiff to enable secure data sharing and analytics in highly regulated domains, paving the way for further advances in federated learning and privacy-preserving data synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, preprint version</p></details> |
| **[From stability of Langevin diffusion to convergence of proximal MCMC for non-log-concave sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14177v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of sampling distributions stemming from non-convex potentials with Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). We prove the stability of the discrete-time ULA to drift approximations under the assumption that the potential is strongly convex at infinity. In many context, e.g. imaging inverse problems, potentials are non-convex and non-smooth. Proximal Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm (PSGLA) is a popular algorithm to handle such potentials. It combines the forward-backward optimization algorithm with a ULA step. Our main stability result combined with properties of the Moreau envelope allows us to derive the first proof of convergence of the PSGLA for non-convex potentials. We empirically validate our methodology on synthetic data and in the context of imaging inverse problems. In particular, we observe that PSGLA exhibits faster convergence rates than Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm for posterior sampling while preserving its restoration properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conforming and discontinuous discretizations of non-isothermal Darcy-Forchheimer flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21630v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present and analyze in a unified setting two schemes for the numerical discretization of a Darcy-Forchheimer fluid flow model coupled with an advection-diffusion equation modeling the temperature distribution in the fluid. The first approach is based on fully discontinuous Galerkin discretization spaces. In contrast, in the second approach, the velocity is approximated in the Raviart-Thomas space, and the pressure and temperature are still piecewise discontinuous. A fixed-point linearization strategy, naturally inducing an iterative splitting solution, is proposed for treating the nonlinearities of the problem. We present a unified stability analysis and prove the convergence of the iterative algorithm under mild requirements on the problem data. A wide set of two- and three-dimensional simulations is presented to assess the error decay and demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed approaches in physically sound test cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding a diffusion model using sliding windows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10257v3)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guidance is a widely used technique for diffusion models to enhance sample quality. Technically, guidance is realised by using an auxiliary model that generalises more broadly than the primary model. Using a 2D toy example, we first show that it is highly beneficial when the auxiliary model exhibits similar but stronger generalisation errors than the primary model. Based on this insight, we introduce \emph{masked sliding window guidance (M-SWG)}, a novel, training-free method. M-SWG upweights long-range spatial dependencies by guiding the primary model with itself by selectively restricting its receptive field. M-SWG requires neither access to model weights from previous iterations, additional training, nor class conditioning. M-SWG achieves a superior Inception score (IS) compared to previous state-of-the-art training-free approaches, without introducing sample oversaturation. In conjunction with existing guidance methods, M-SWG reaches state-of-the-art Frechet DINOv2 distance on ImageNet using EDM2-XXL and DiT-XL. The code is available at https://github.com/HHU-MMBS/swg_bmvc2025_official.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BMVC 2025. 30 pages, 16 figures in total, including appendix</p></details> |

The notion of conductance of permutations was introduced in the paper "Indifferentiability of Confusion-Diffusion Networks" by Dodis et al., where the search for low-conductance permutations was initiated and motivated. In this paper we not only give the desired examples, but also make a general characterization of the problem -- i.e. we show that low-conductance permutations are equivalent to permutations that have the information-theoretic properties of the so-called Multi-Source-Somewhere-Condensers.</p></details> |  |
| **[OASIS: Harnessing Diffusion Adversarial Network for Ocean Salinity Imputation using Sparse Drifter Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21570v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy, especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote sensing and optimal interpolation, rely on linearity and stationarity, and are limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address these challenges.</p></details> | CIKM 2025 Accepted |
| **[ECHO: Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21556v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion, object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space, enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Complete Gaussian Splats from a Single Image with Denoising Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21542v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats, including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference. Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background, reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 11 pages; Supplementary materials: 7 pages</p></details> |
| **[Stochastic Control for Fine-tuning Diffusion Models: Optimality, Regularity, and Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18164v4)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling, demonstrating exceptional capability in capturing target data distributions from large datasets. However, fine-tuning these massive models for specific downstream tasks, constraints, and human preferences remains a critical challenge. While recent advances have leveraged reinforcement learning algorithms to tackle this problem, much of the progress has been empirical, with limited theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose a stochastic control framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. Building on denoising diffusion probabilistic models as the pre-trained reference dynamics, our approach integrates linear dynamics control with Kullback-Leibler regularization. We establish the well-posedness and regularity of the stochastic control problem and develop a policy iteration algorithm (PI-FT) for numerical solution. We show that PI-FT achieves global convergence at a linear rate. Unlike existing work that assumes regularities throughout training, we prove that the control and value sequences generated by the algorithm maintain the regularity. Additionally, we explore extensions of our framework to parametric settings and continuous-time formulations, and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed PI-FT algorithm through numerical experiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/yinbinhan/fine-tuning-of-diffusion-models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages; first version: Dec 2024; this version: Aug 2025</p></details> |
| **[Few-Shot Neuro-Symbolic Imitation Learning for Long-Horizon Planning and Acting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21501v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning enables intelligent systems to acquire complex behaviors with minimal supervision. However, existing methods often focus on short-horizon skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve long-horizon tasks or generalize across task variations and distribution shifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that jointly learns continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions from a few skill demonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures into a graph, discovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and trains low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level oracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal observation and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables capturing complex state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal relations, that data-driven learning or clustering techniques often fail to discover in limited demonstration datasets. We validate our approach in six domains that involve four robotic arms, Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, and Towers of Hanoi environments, and a distinct Automated Forklift domain with two environments. The results demonstrate high data efficiency with as few as five skill demonstrations, strong zero- and few-shot generalizations, and interpretable decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CoRL 2025; to appear in PMLR</p></details> |
| **[Controllable 3D Molecular Generation for Structure-Based Drug Design Through Bayesian Flow Networks and Gradient Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21468v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug discovery applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network for Click-through Rate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21460v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex interactions between modalities. To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module, and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities, improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least 1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing multi-modal recommendation systems.

| **[Equivariant Hypergraph Diffusion for Crystal Structure Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18850v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) remains a fundamental challenge with significant implications for the development of new materials and the advancement of various scientific disciplines. Recent developments have shown that generative models, particularly diffusion models, hold great promise for CSP. However, traditional graph-based representations, where atomic bonds are modeled as pairwise graph edges, fail to fully capture the intricate high-order interactions essential for accurately representing crystal structures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes hypergraphs to represent crystal structures, providing a more expressive abstraction for modeling multi-way atomic interactions. By adopting hypergraphs, we can effectively capture complex high-order relationships and symmetries, such as permutation and periodic translation invariance, which are crucial for characterizing crystal structures. In this work, we propose the \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{H}ypergraph \textbf{Diff}usion Model (\textbf{EH-Diff}), a generative model designed to take advantage of the symmetry-preserving properties of hypergraphs. EH-Diff exploits these features to offer an efficient and accurate method for predicting crystal structures with a strong theoretical justification to preserve invariance properties. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that EH-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art CSP methods with only one sample.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data, MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models. Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging.

However, organs such as the large intestine remain particularly challenging due to their complex geometry and shape variability. We propose CLAP, a novel Conditional LAtent Point-diffusion model that combines geometric deep learning with denoising diffusion models to enhance 3D representations of the large intestine. Given point clouds sampled from segmentation masks, we employ a hierarchical variational autoencoder to learn both global and local latent shape representations. Two conditional diffusion models operate within this latent space to refine the organ shape. A pretrained surface reconstruction model is then used to convert the refined point clouds into meshes. CLAP achieves substantial improvements in shape modeling accuracy, reducing Chamfer distance by 26% and Hausdorff distance by 36% relative to the initial suboptimal shapes. This approach offers a robust and extensible solution for high-fidelity organ modeling, with potential applicability to a wide range of anatomical structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics-Compliant Trajectory Diffusion for Super-Nominal Payload Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21375v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error, optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 Conference on Robot Learning [CoRL]</p></details> |
| **[CLUE-MARK: Watermarking Diffusion Models using CLWE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11434v4)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI-generated images become widespread, reliable watermarking is essential for content verification, copyright enforcement, and combating disinformation. Existing techniques rely on heuristic approaches and lack formal guarantees of undetectability, making them vulnerable to steganographic attacks that can expose or erase the watermark. Additionally, these techniques often degrade output quality by introducing perceptible changes, which is not only undesirable but an important barrier to adoption in practice. In this work, we introduce CLUE-Mark, the first provably undetectable watermarking scheme for diffusion models. CLUE-Mark requires no changes to the model being watermarked, is computationally efficient, and because it is provably undetectable is guaranteed to have no impact on model output quality. Our approach leverages the Continuous Learning With Errors (CLWE) problem -- a cryptographically hard lattice problem -- to embed watermarks in the latent noise vectors used by diffusion models. By proving undetectability via reduction from a cryptographically hard problem we ensure not only that the watermark is imperceptible to human observers or adhoc heuristics, but to \emph{any} efficient detector that does not have the secret key. CLUE-Mark allows multiple keys to be embedded, enabling traceability of images to specific users without altering model parameters. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art diffusion models confirm that CLUE-Mark achieves high recoverability, preserves image quality, and is robust to minor perturbations such JPEG compression and brightness adjustments. Uniquely, CLUE-Mark cannot be detected nor removed by recent steganographic attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation with Hierarchical Temporal Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21363v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1) Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Our method utilizes a two-point flux approximation and is part of the exponentially fitted scheme framework. The scheme is shown to be thermodynamically consistent, as it ensures the decay of some discrete version of the free energy. Classical numerical analysis results -- existence of discrete solution, convergence of the scheme as the grid size and the time step go to $0$ -- follow. We also investigate the long-time behavior of the scheme, both from a theoretical and numerical point of view. Numerical simulations confirm our findings, but also point out some possibly very slow convergence towards equilibrium of the system under consideration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stage-Diff: Stage-wise Long-Term Time Series Generation Based on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21330v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling, effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Trained diffusion models can also be very effective image priors for solving inverse problems. Most of the existing diffusion-based methods integrate data consistency steps by approximating the likelihood function within the diffusion reverse sampling process. In this paper, we show that the existing approximations are either insufficient or computationally inefficient. To address these issues, we propose a unified likelihood approximation method that incorporates a covariance correction term to enhance the performance and avoids propagating gradients through the diffusion model. The correction term, when integrated into the reverse diffusion sampling process, achieves better convergence towards the true data posterior for selected distributions and improves performance on real-world natural image datasets. Furthermore, we present an efficient way to factorize and invert the covariance matrix of the likelihood function for several inverse problems. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over several existing approaches. Code available at https://github.com/CSIPlab/CoDPS.</p></details> |  |

First, our proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering. This approach generates high-fidelity mmWave flow fields-compact 2D vector representations of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these fields into directed geometric graphs. In these graphs, edges capture dominant flow currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is quantified across edges. Finally, we show that analyzing the local Jacobian and computing the corresponding curl and divergence enables extraction of key crowd semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on crowds of up to 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift, dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate mmFlux, underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |

Traditional HMR methods are designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient, requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose estimators to enhance their performance.

In this sense, support points offer a compact yet informative representation of the original data. We build on this idea to introduce a generative modeling framework based on random weighted support points, where the randomness arises from a weighting scheme inspired by the Dirichlet process and the Bayesian bootstrap. The proposed method generates diverse and interpretable sample sets from a fixed dataset, without relying on probabilistic modeling assumptions or neural network architectures. We present the theoretical formulation of the method and develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Convex--Concave Procedure (CCP). Empirical results on the MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets show that our approach produces high-quality and diverse outputs at a fraction of the computational cost of black-box alternatives such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). These results suggest that random weighted support points offer a principled, scalable, and interpretable alternative for generative modeling. A key feature is their ability to produce genuinely interpolative samples that preserve underlying data structure.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

These variations arise from changes in imaging protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density, T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols, realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mutual Information Rate -- Linear Noise Approximation and Exact Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21220v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient information processing is crucial for both living organisms and engineered systems. The mutual information rate, a core concept of information theory, quantifies the amount of information shared between the trajectories of input and output signals, and enables the quantification of information flow in dynamic systems. A common approach for estimating the mutual information rate is the Gaussian approximation which assumes that the input and output trajectories follow Gaussian statistics. However, this method is limited to linear systems, and its accuracy in nonlinear or discrete systems remains unclear. In this work, we assess the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation for non-Gaussian systems by leveraging Path Weight Sampling (PWS), a recent technique for exactly computing the mutual information rate. In two case studies, we examine the limitations of the Gaussian approximation. First, we focus on discrete linear systems and demonstrate that, even when the system's statistics are nearly Gaussian, the Gaussian approximation fails to accurately estimate the mutual information rate. Second, we explore a continuous diffusive system with a nonlinear transfer function, revealing significant deviations between the Gaussian approximation and the exact mutual information rate as nonlinearity increases. Our results provide a quantitative evaluation of the Gaussian approximation's performance across different stochastic models and highlight when more computationally intensive methods, such as PWS, are necessary.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic; multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at the input layer (dubbed seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as (and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and temperature sampling.

However, degradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a major challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio restoration, they typically require significant computational resources and struggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM (Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and denoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral domain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing computational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves accurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores (0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still underperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual quality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to suboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient training duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a neural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for future development.</p></details> |  |

However, it is unclear whether existing watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge. The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track, depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain. Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the development of more robust image watermarking methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Winni...</summary><p>Winning solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge</p></details> |

| **[Mixture of Contexts for Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21058v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://primecai.github.io/moc/</p></details> |

Its reliability and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders. This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with high-quality research acquisitions.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |

While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency, we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models, where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater efficiency.

Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models. To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii) conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment, temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pose-paper.github.io</p></details> |

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for fine-tuning generative models, existing methods like DDPO and DPOK face fundamental limitations - particularly their inability to maintain stable optimization when scaling to large and diverse prompt sets, severely restricting their practical utility. This paper presents DanceGRPO, a framework that addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for visual generation tasks. Our key insight is that GRPO's inherent stability mechanisms uniquely position it to overcome the optimization challenges that plague prior RL-based approaches on visual generation. DanceGRPO establishes several significant advances: First, it demonstrates consistent and stable policy optimization across multiple modern generative paradigms, including both diffusion models and rectified flows. Second, it maintains robust performance when scaling to complex, real-world scenarios encompassing three key tasks and four foundation models. Third, it shows remarkable versatility in optimizing for diverse human preferences as captured by five distinct reward models assessing image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary feedback. Our comprehensive experiments reveal that DanceGRPO outperforms baseline methods by up to 181\% across multiple established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dancegrpo.github.io/</p></details> |

However, aligning their output distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences, compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering. Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference.

This critical problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety, thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree (DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs. DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate.

At the heart of LGDE lies the creation of a word similarity graph from the geometry of word embeddings followed by local community detection based on graph diffusion. The diffusion in the local graph manifold allows the exploration of the complex nonlinear geometry of word embeddings to capture word similarities based on paths of semantic association, over and above direct pairwise similarities. Exploiting such semantic neighbourhoods enables the expansion of dictionaries of pre-selected keywords, an important step for tasks in information retrieval, such as database queries and online data collection. We validate LGDE on two user-generated English-language corpora and show that LGDE enriches the list of keywords with improved performance relative to methods based on direct word similarities or co-occurrences. We further demonstrate our method through a real-world use case from communication science, where LGDE is evaluated quantitatively on the expansion of a conspiracy-related dictionary from online data collected and analysed by domain experts. Our empirical results and expert user assessment indicate that LGDE expands the seed dictionary with more useful keywords due to the manifold-learning-based similarity network.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pytho...</summary><p>Python code available at: https://github.com/barahona-research-group/LGDE</p></details> |

Prior generative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of dexterous hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in partial point clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We propose FFHFlow, a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse, robust multi-finger grasps while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty in the partial point clouds. Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based deep latent variable model to learn a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming the mode collapse and rigid prior limitations of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility and exact likelihoods of flows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial observations and identifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis. To further enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with the flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that prioritizes grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (including diffusion models) in grasp diversity and success rate, while achieving run-time efficient sampling. We also showcase its practical value in cluttered and confined environments, where diversity-driven sampling excels by mitigating collisions (Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/ffhflow/home/).</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally, whose ordering decided via coin-tossing.

In an associated energy-type norm that is natural for this problem, we prove an $O(\varepsilon^{1/2}N^{-1}+\varepsilon N^{-1}\ln N + N^{-3/2})$ rate of convergence for the error in the computed solution, where $N$~is the number of mesh intervals in each coordinate direction. Thus in the most troublesome regime when $\varepsilon \approx N^{-1}$, our method is proved to attain an $O(N^{-3/2})$ rate of convergence, which is shown to be sharp by our numerical experiments and is superior to the $O(N^{-1/2})$ rate that is proved in Meng & Stynes, Adv. Comput. Math. 2019 when Adini finite elements are used to solve the same problem on the same mesh.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Fine-Grained Control via Aggregation of Multiple Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01262v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many diffusion models perform well when controlling particular aspects such as style, character, and interaction, they struggle with fine-grained control due to dataset limitations and intricate model architecture design. This paper introduces a novel training-free algorithm, independent of denoising network architectures, for fine-grained generation, called Aggregation of Multiple Diffusion Models (AMDM). The algorithm integrates features from multiple diffusion models into a specified model to activate particular features and enable fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that AMDM significantly improves fine-grained control without training, validating its effectiveness. Additionally, it reveals that diffusion models initially focus on features such as position, attributes, and style, with later stages improving generation quality and consistency. AMDM offers a new perspective for tackling the challenges of fine-grained conditional generation in diffusion models. Specifically, it allows us to fully utilize existing or develop new conditional diffusion models that control specific aspects, and then aggregate them using the AMDM algorithm. This eliminates the need for constructing complex datasets, designing intricate model architectures, and incurring high training costs.

| **[Pixel Motion as Universal Representation for Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07817v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LangToMo, a vision-language-action framework structured as a dual-system architecture that uses pixel motion forecasts as intermediate representations. Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a weakly-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on any video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

| **[Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20783v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts. Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models -- Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of relational concepts such as left and right.

| **[Diffusion Models for Image Restoration and Enhancement: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09388v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) has been an indispensable and challenging task in the low-level vision field, which strives to improve the subjective quality of images distorted by various forms of degradation. Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCV |

Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 workshop on Machine Unlearning for Generative AI</p></details> |
| **[EEGDM: Learning EEG Representation with Latent Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20705v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks, particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its generalizability and practical utility.</p></details> |  |
| **["Humor, Art, or Misinformation?": A Multimodal Dataset for Intent-Aware Synthetic Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20670v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art, or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies (image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning, reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amadeus: Autoregressive Model with Bidirectional Attribute Modelling for Symbolic Music](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20665v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing state-of-the-art symbolic music generation models predominantly adopt autoregressive or hierarchical autoregressive architectures, modelling symbolic music as a sequence of attribute tokens with unidirectional temporal dependencies, under the assumption of a fixed, strict dependency structure among these attributes. However, we observe that using different attributes as the initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This suggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent and unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this insight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework. Amadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note sequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To enhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement Strategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify discriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent vector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and text-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA models across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\times$ speed-up. Furthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control feasibility using our model. To explore the upper performance bound of the Amadeus architecture, we compile the largest open-source symbolic music dataset to date, AMD (Amadeus MIDI Dataset), supporting both pre-training and fine-tuning.</p></details> | Under review |

The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[VarDiU: A Variational Diffusive Upper Bound for One-Step Diffusion Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20646v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced /va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leyan...</summary><p>Leyang Wang and Mingtian Zhang contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[CraftGraffiti: Exploring Human Identity with Custom Graffiti Art via Facial-Preserving Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20640v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence. We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after" paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order. Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmoCAST: Emotional Talking Portrait via Emotive Text Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20615v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling, emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive, and audio-synchronized talking-head videos.

| **[Physics Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20612v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML) models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples. In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising results to optimize the defect localization process.</p></details> |  |
| **[STDiff: A State Transition Diffusion Framework for Time Series Imputation in Industrial Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19011v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastFit: Accelerating Multi-Reference Virtual Try-On via Cacheable Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20586v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead. This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms, dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode, and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, building such a practical system that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains challenging to existing methods, which often struggle with heavy computational cost and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal control and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal modifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts multimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs spatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising process of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale dialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing rich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep compression autoencoder with up to 64$\times$ reduction ratio, which effectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive model. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human synthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach in low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/showlab/Ego-PM</p></details> |
