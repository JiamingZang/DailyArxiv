| **[Provable Long-Range Benefits of Next-Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07818v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do modern language models, trained to do well on next-word prediction, appear to generate coherent documents and capture long-range structure? Here we show that next-token prediction is provably powerful for learning longer-range structure, even with common neural network architectures. Specifically, we prove that optimizing next-token prediction over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) yields a model that closely approximates the training distribution: for held-out documents sampled from the training distribution, no algorithm of bounded description length limited to examining the next $k$ tokens, for any $k$, can distinguish between $k$ consecutive tokens of such documents and $k$ tokens generated by the learned language model following the same prefix. We provide polynomial bounds (in $k$, independent of the document length) on the model size needed to achieve such $k$-token indistinguishability, offering a complexity-theoretic explanation for the long-range coherence observed in practice.</p></details> | 66 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Toward Seamless Physical Human-Humanoid Interaction: Insights from Control, Intent, and Modeling with a Vision for What Comes Next](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07765v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical Human-Humanoid Interaction (pHHI) is a rapidly advancing field with significant implications for deploying robots in unstructured, human-centric environments. In this review, we examine the current state of the art in pHHI through three core pillars: (i) humanoid modeling and control, (ii) human intent estimation, and (iii) computational human models. For each pillar, we survey representative approaches, identify open challenges, and analyze current limitations that hinder robust, scalable, and adaptive interaction. These include the need for whole-body control strategies capable of handling uncertain human dynamics, real-time intent inference under limited sensing, and modeling techniques that account for variability in human physical states. Although significant progress has been made within each domain, integration across pillars remains limited. We propose pathways for unifying methods across these areas to enable cohesive interaction frameworks. This structure enables us not only to map the current landscape but also to propose concrete directions for future research that aim to bridge these domains. Additionally, we introduce a unified taxonomy of interaction types based on modality, distinguishing between direct interactions (e.g., physical contact) and indirect interactions (e.g., object-mediated), and on the level of robot engagement, ranging from assistance to cooperation and collaboration. For each category in this taxonomy, we provide the three core pillars that highlight opportunities for cross-pillar unification. Our goal is to suggest avenues to advance robust, safe, and intuitive physical interaction, providing a roadmap for future research that will allow humanoid systems to effectively understand, anticipate, and collaborate with human partners in diverse real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Optimization-Guided Diffusion for Interactive Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07661v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic and diverse multi-agent driving scenes are crucial for evaluating autonomous vehicles, but safety-critical events which are essential for this task are rare and underrepresented in driving datasets. Data-driven scene generation offers a low-cost alternative by synthesizing complex traffic behaviors from existing driving logs. However, existing models often lack controllability or yield samples that violate physical or social constraints, limiting their usability. We present OMEGA, an optimization-guided, training-free framework that enforces structural consistency and interaction awareness during diffusion-based sampling from a scene generation model. OMEGA re-anchors each reverse diffusion step via constrained optimization, steering the generation towards physically plausible and behaviorally coherent trajectories. Building on this framework, we formulate ego-attacker interactions as a game-theoretic optimization in the distribution space, approximating Nash equilibria to generate realistic, safety-critical adversarial scenarios. Experiments on nuPlan and Waymo show that OMEGA improves generation realism, consistency, and controllability, increasing the ratio of physically and behaviorally valid scenes from 32.35% to 72.27% for free exploration capabilities, and from 11% to 80% for controllability-focused generation. Our approach can also generate $5\times$ more near-collision frames with a time-to-collision under three seconds while maintaining the overall scene realism.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOOL4POI: A Tool-Augmented LLM Framework for Next POI Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06405v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a fundamental task in location-based services. While recent advances leverage Large Language Model (LLM) for sequential modeling, existing LLM-based approaches face two key limitations: (i) strong reliance on the contextual completeness of user histories, resulting in poor performance on out-of-history (OOH) scenarios; (ii) limited scalability, due to the restricted context window of LLMs, which limits their ability to access and process a large number of candidate POIs. To address these challenges, we propose Tool4POI, a novel tool-augmented framework that enables LLMs to perform open-set POI recommendation through external retrieval and reasoning. Tool4POI consists of three key modules: preference extraction module, multi-turn candidate retrieval module, and reranking module, which together summarize long-term user interests, interact with external tools to retrieve relevant POIs, and refine final recommendations based on recent behaviors. Unlike existing methods, Tool4POI requires no task-specific fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that Tool4POI substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 40% accuracy on challenging OOH scenarios where existing methods fail, and delivering average improvements of 20% and 30% on Acc@5 and Acc@10, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cri...</summary><p>A critical technical error was discovered during our internal review, leading to unreliable experimental results.

| **[From GPUs to RRAMs: Distributed In-Memory Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Solving Large-Scale Linear Optimization Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21137v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of computational workloads is surpassing the capabilities of conventional architectures, which are constrained by fundamental limits. In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Article (14 Pages, 3 Figures), Appendix (5 Pages) Accepted for presentation at SIAM PP26</p></details> |
| **[Specializing anti-unification for interaction models composition via gate connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07595v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction models describe distributed systems as algebraic terms, with gates marking interaction points between local views. Composing local models into a coherent global one requires aligning these gates while respecting the algebraic laws of interaction operators. We specialize anti-unification (or generalization) via a special constant-preserving variant, which preserves designated constants while generalizing the remaining structure. We develop a dedicated rule-based procedure for computing these generalizations, prove its termination, soundness, and completeness, extend it modulo equational theories, and integrate it into a standard anti-unification framework. A prototype tool demonstrates the approach's ability to recompose global interactions from partial views.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (21 in the article, 5 pages in appendices), 7 figures, 6 tables, submitted to Formal Methods 2026 (FM 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Tokenizing Motion: A Generative Approach for Scene Dynamics Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09768v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel generative video compression framework that leverages motion pattern priors, derived from subtle dynamics in common scenes (e.g., swaying flowers or a boat drifting on water), rather than relying on video content priors (e.g., talking faces or human bodies). These compact motion priors enable a new approach to ultra-low bitrate communication while achieving high-quality reconstruction across diverse scene contents. At the encoder side, motion priors can be streamlined into compact representations via a dense-to-sparse transformation. At the decoder side, these priors facilitate the reconstruction of scene dynamics using an advanced flow-driven diffusion model. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion-performance and outperform the state-of-the-art conventional-video codec Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) on-scene dynamics sequences.

| **[Machine Learning: Progress and Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07519v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This Inaugural Lecture was given at Royal Holloway University of London in 1996. It covers an introduction to machine learning and describes various theoretical advances and practical projects in the field. The Lecture here is presented in its original format, but a few remarks have been added in 2025 to reflect recent developments, and the list of references has been updated to enhance the convenience and accuracy for readers. When did machine learning start? Maybe a good starting point is 1949, when Claude Shannon proposed a learning algorithm for chess-playing programs. Or maybe we should go back to the 1930s when Ronald Fisher developed discriminant analysis - a type of learning where the problem is to construct a decision rule that separates two types of vectors. Or could it be the 18th century when David Hume discussed the idea of induction? Or the 14th century, when William of Ockham formulated the principle of "simplicity" known as "Ockham's razor" (Ockham, by the way, is a small village not far from Royal Holloway). Or it may be that, like almost everything else in Western civilisation and culture, the origin of these ideas lies in the Mediterranean. After all, it was Aristotle who said that "we learn some things only by doing things". The field of machine learning has been greatly influenced by other disciplines and the subject is in itself not a very homogeneous discipline, but includes separate, overlapping subfields. There are many parallel lines of research in ML: inductive learning, neural networks, clustering, and theories of learning. They are all part of the more general field of machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inaug...</summary><p>Inaugural Lecture. 18 pages, 13 figures, Published in 1997 by Royal Holloway, University of London, ISBN 0 900145 93 5</p></details> |
| **[Exploring possible vector systems for faster training of neural networks with preconfigured latent spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07509v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The overall neural network (NN) performance is closely related to the properties of its embedding distribution in latent space (LS). It has recently been shown that predefined vector systems, specifically An root system vectors, can be used as targets for latent space configurations (LSC) to ensure the desired LS structure. One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training. It is also shown that using the minimum number of LS dimensions for a specific number of classes results in faster convergence. The latter has potential advantages for reducing the size of vector databases used to store NN embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 4 equations</p></details> |
| **[Artificial Intelligence and Nuclear Weapons Proliferation: The Technological Arms Race for (In)visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07487v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A robust nonproliferation regime has contained the spread of nuclear weapons to just nine states. Yet, emerging and disruptive technologies are reshaping the landscape of nuclear risks, presenting a critical juncture for decision makers. This article lays out the contours of an overlooked but intensifying technological arms race for nuclear (in)visibility, driven by the interplay between proliferation-enabling technologies (PETs) and detection-enhancing technologies (DETs). We argue that the strategic pattern of proliferation will be increasingly shaped by the innovation pace in these domains. Artificial intelligence (AI) introduces unprecedented complexity to this equation, as its rapid scaling and knowledge substitution capabilities accelerate PET development and challenge traditional monitoring and verification methods. To analyze this dynamic, we develop a formal model centered on a Relative Advantage Index (RAI), quantifying the shifting balance between PETs and DETs. Our model explores how asymmetric technological advancement, particularly logistic AI-driven PET growth versus stepwise DET improvements, expands the band of uncertainty surrounding proliferation detectability. Through replicable scenario-based simulations, we evaluate the impact of varying PET growth rates and DET investment strategies on cumulative nuclear breakout risk. We identify a strategic fork ahead, where detection may no longer suffice without broader PET governance. Governments and international organizations should accordingly invest in policies and tools agile enough to keep pace with tomorrow's technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best Paper Award (2025) from Risk Analysis as one of the articles published in the journal that year with the most significant impacts to the theory or practice of risk analysis.

| **[An Analysis of Decision Problems for Relational Pattern Languages under Various Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07476v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patterns are words with terminals and variables. The language of a pattern is the set of words obtained by uniformly substituting all variables with words that contain only terminals. In their original definition, patterns only allow for multiple distinct occurrences of some variables to be related by the equality relation, represented by using the same variable multiple times. In an extended notion, called relational patterns and relational pattern languages, variables may be related by arbitrary other relations. We extend the ongoing investigation of the main decision problems for patterns (namely, the membership problem, the inclusion problem, and the equivalence problem) to relational pattern languages under a wide range of individual relations. It is shown show that - even for many much simpler or less restrictive relations - the complexity and (un)decidability characteristics of these problems do not change compared to the classical case where variables are related only by equality.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages (incl. appendix and references), 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Living the Novel: A System for Generating Self-Training Timeline-Aware Conversational Agents from Novels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07474v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the Living Novel, an end-to-end system that transforms any literary work into an immersive, multi-character conversational experience. This system is designed to solve two fundamental challenges for LLM-driven characters. Firstly, generic LLMs suffer from persona drift, often failing to stay in character. Secondly, agents often exhibit abilities that extend beyond the constraints of the story's world and logic, leading to both narrative incoherence (spoiler leakage) and robustness failures (frame-breaking). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage training pipeline. Our Deep Persona Alignment (DPA) stage uses data-free reinforcement finetuning to instill deep character fidelity. Our Coherence and Robustness Enhancing (CRE) stage then employs a story-time-aware knowledge graph and a second retrieval-grounded training pass to architecturally enforce these narrative constraints. We validate our system through a multi-phase evaluation using Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. A lab study with a detailed ablation of system components is followed by a 5-day in-the-wild diary study. Our DPA pipeline helps our specialized model outperform GPT-4o on persona-specific metrics, and our CRE stage achieves near-perfect performance in coherence and robustness measures. Our study surfaces practical design guidelines for AI-driven narrative systems: we find that character-first self-training is foundational for believability, while explicit story-time constraints are crucial for sustaining coherent, interruption-resilient mobile-web experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Show Programmes to Data: Designing a Workflow to Make Performing Arts Ephemera Accessible Through Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07452v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many heritage institutions hold extensive collections of theatre programmes, which remain largely underused due to their complex layouts and lack of structured metadata. In this paper, we present a workflow for transforming such documents into structured data using a combination of multimodal large language models (LLMs), an ontology-based reasoning model, and a custom extension of the Linked Art framework. We show how vision-language models can accurately parse and transcribe born-digital and digitised programmes, achieving over 98% of correct extraction. To overcome the challenges of semantic annotation, we train a reasoning model (POntAvignon) using reinforcement learning with both formal and semantic rewards. This approach enables automated RDF triple generation and supports alignment with existing knowledge graphs. Through a case study based on the Festival d'Avignon corpus, we demonstrate the potential for large-scale, ontology-driven analysis of performing arts data. Our results open new possibilities for interoperable, explainable, and sustainable computational theatre historiography.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, 17 references</p></details> |
| **[WaggleNet: A LoRa and MQTT-Based Monitoring System for Internal and External Beehive Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07408v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bee populations are declining globally due to habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and climate change, threatening agricultural productivity and food security. While existing smart beehive systems monitor internal conditions, they typically overlook external environmental factors that significantly influence colony health, and are constrained by high cost, limited scalability, and inadequate contextual analysis. We present WaggleNet, a novel dual-scope monitoring system that simultaneously captures both internal hive conditions and external environmental parameters using a cost-effective LoRa-MQTT architecture. Our system deploys modular worker nodes ($\sim$\$15 each) equipped with temperature, humidity, light, and GPS sensors both inside and around beehives. A master node functions as a LoRa-MQTT gateway, forwarding data to a cloud server with a mobile application interface. Field experiments confirmed reliable operation with 100\% packet delivery over 110 meters in line-of-sight conditions and 95 meters in obstructed environments, including successful deployment inside wooden hive structures. Our system demonstrated stable end-to-end latency under 5 seconds and continuous operation over a two-month period across diverse environmental conditions. By bridging the gap between internal and external monitoring, WaggleNet enables contextual anomaly detection and supports data-driven precision beekeeping in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The system is part of the National High Performance Computing (NHR) initiative. Otus complements the previous supercomputer Noctua 2, offering approximately twice the computing power while retaining the three node types that were characteristic of Noctua 2: 1) CPU compute nodes with different memory capacities, 2) high-end GPU nodes, and 3) HPC-grade FPGA nodes.

On the Green500 list, ranking the 500 most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world, Otus is in position 5 with the GPU partition (June 2025). This article provides a comprehensive overview of the system in terms of its hardware, software, system integration, and its overall integration into the data center building to ensure energy-efficient operation. The article aims to provide unique insights for scientists using the system and for other centers operating HPC clusters.

| **[Debiasing Diffusion Priors via 3D Attention for Consistent Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07345v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Versatile 3D tasks (e.g., generation or editing) that distill from Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have attracted significant research interest for not relying on extensive 3D training data. However, T2I models exhibit limitations resulting from prior view bias, which produces conflicting appearances between different views of an object. This bias causes subject-words to preferentially activate prior view features during cross-attention (CA) computation, regardless of the target view condition. To overcome this limitation, we conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis to reveal the root cause of the prior view bias in T2I models. Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians. Notably, HAM facilitates semantic-specific interventions, enabling controllable and precise 3D editing. Extensive experiments firmly establish that TD-Attn has the potential to serve as a universal plugin, significantly enhancing multi-view consistency across 3D tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, 2 algorithms, Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Expectation-Maximization as the Engine of Scalable Medical Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03410v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large, high-quality, annotated datasets are the foundation of medical AI research, but constructing even a small, moderate-quality, annotated dataset can take years of effort from multidisciplinary teams. Although active learning can prioritize what to annotate, scaling up still requires extensive manual efforts to revise the noisy annotations. We formulate this as a missing-data problem and develop ScaleMAI, a framework that unifies data annotation and model development co-evolution through an Expectation-Maximization (EM) process. In this iterative process, the AI model automatically identifies and corrects the mistakes in annotations (Expectation), while the refined annotated data retrain the model to improve accuracy (Maximization). In addition to the classical EM algorithm, ScaleMAI brings human experts into the loop to review annotations that cannot be adequately addressed by either Expectation or Maximization step (<5%). As a result, ScaleMAI progressively creates an annotated dataset of 47,315 CT scans (4.8x larger than the largest public dataset, PanTS) including 4,163,720 per-voxel annotations for benign/malignant tumors and 88 anatomical structures. ScaleMAI iteratively trains a model that exceeds human expert performance in tumor diagnosis (+7%), and outperforms models developed from smaller, moderate-quality datasets, with statistically significant gains in tumor detection (+10%) and segmentation (+14%) on two prestigious benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient ASR for Low-Resource Languages: Leveraging Cross-Lingual Unlabeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07277v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic speech recognition for low-resource languages remains fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and computational resources required by state-of-the-art models. We present a systematic investigation into cross-lingual continuous pretraining for low-resource languages, using Perso-Arabic languages (Persian, Arabic, and Urdu) as our primary case study. Our approach demonstrates that strategic utilization of unlabeled speech data can effectively bridge the resource gap without sacrificing recognition accuracy. We construct a 3,000-hour multilingual corpus through a scalable unlabeled data collection pipeline and employ targeted continual pretraining combined with morphologically-aware tokenization to develop a 300M parameter model that achieves performance comparable to systems 5 times larger. Our model outperforms Whisper Large v3 (1.5B parameters) on Persian and achieves competitive results on Arabic and Urdu despite using significantly fewer parameters and substantially less labeled data. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that ASR quality scales primarily with model size, revealing instead that data relevance and strategic pretraining are more critical factors for low-resource scenarios. This work provides a practical pathway toward inclusive speech technology, enabling effective ASR for underrepresented languages without dependence on massive computational infrastructure or proprietary datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AACL IJCNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-platform Product Matching Based on Entity Alignment of Knowledge Graph with RAEA model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07232v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Product matching aims to identify identical or similar products sold on different platforms. By building knowledge graphs (KGs), the product matching problem can be converted to the Entity Alignment (EA) task, which aims to discover the equivalent entities from diverse KGs. The existing EA methods inadequately utilize both attribute triples and relation triples simultaneously, especially the interactions between them. This paper introduces a two-stage pipeline consisting of rough filter and fine filter to match products from eBay and Amazon. For fine filtering, a new framework for Entity Alignment, Relation-aware and Attribute-aware Graph Attention Networks for Entity Alignment (RAEA), is employed. RAEA focuses on the interactions between attribute triples and relation triples, where the entity representation aggregates the alignment signals from attributes and relations with Attribute-aware Entity Encoder and Relation-aware Graph Attention Networks. The experimental results indicate that the RAEA model achieves significant improvements over 12 baselines on EA task in the cross-lingual dataset DBP15K (6.59% on average Hits@1) and delivers competitive results in the monolingual dataset DWY100K. The source code for experiments on DBP15K and DWY100K is available at github (https://github.com/Mockingjay-liu/RAEA-model-for-Entity-Alignment).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, published on World Wide Web</p></details> |

This paper presents a comprehensive visual comparison between CLIP based and DINOv2 based approaches for 3D pose estimation in hand object grasping scenarios. We evaluate both models on the task of 6D object pose estimation and demonstrate their complementary strengths: CLIP excels in semantic understanding through language grounding, while DINOv2 provides superior dense geometric features. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that CLIP based methods achieve better semantic consistency, while DINOv2 based approaches demonstrate competitive performance with enhanced geometric precision. Our analysis provides insights for selecting appropriate vision models for robotic manipulation and grasping, picking applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Pose Distribution Estimation for Determining Revolution and Reflection Uncertainty in Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07211v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation is crucial to robotic perception and typically provides a single-pose estimate. However, a single estimate cannot capture pose uncertainty deriving from visual ambiguity, which can lead to unreliable behavior. Existing pose distribution methods rely heavily on color information, often unavailable in industrial settings. We propose a novel neural network-based method for estimating object pose uncertainty using only 3D colorless data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that leverages deep learning for pose distribution estimation without relying on RGB input. We validate our method in a real-world bin picking scenario with objects of varying geometric ambiguity. Our current implementation focuses on symmetries in reflection and revolution, but the framework is extendable to full SE(3) pose distribution estimation.

| **[Synchrony-Gated Plasticity with Dopamine Modulation for Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07194v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While surrogate backpropagation proves useful for training deep spiking neural networks (SNNs), incorporating biologically inspired local signals on a large scale remains challenging. This difficulty stems primarily from the high memory demands of maintaining accurate spike-timing logs and the potential for purely local plasticity adjustments to clash with the supervised learning goal. To effectively leverage local signals derived from spiking neuron dynamics, we introduce Dopamine-Modulated Spike-Synchrony-Dependent Plasticity (DA-SSDP), a synchrony-based rule that is sensitive to loss and brings a synchrony-based local learning signal to the model. DA-SSDP condenses spike patterns into a synchrony metric at the batch level. An initial brief warm-up phase assesses its relationship to the task loss and sets a fixed gate that subsequently adjusts the local update's magnitude. In cases where synchrony proves unrelated to the task, the gate settles at one, simplifying DA-SSDP to a basic two-factor synchrony mechanism that delivers minor weight adjustments driven by concurrent spike firing and a Gaussian latency function. These small weight updates are only added to the network`s deeper layers following the backpropagation phase, and our tests showed this simplified version did not degrade performance and sometimes gave a small accuracy boost, serving as a regularizer during training. The rule stores only binary spike indicators and first-spike latencies with a Gaussian kernel.

| **[PICKT: Practical Interlinked Concept Knowledge Tracing for Personalized Learning using Knowledge Map Concept Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07179v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent surge in personalized learning, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) that can accurately track students' individual knowledge states and provide tailored learning paths based on this information are in demand as an essential task. This paper focuses on the core technology of Knowledge Tracing (KT) models that analyze students' sequences of interactions to predict their knowledge acquisition levels. However, existing KT models suffer from limitations such as restricted input data formats, cold start problems arising with new student enrollment or new question addition, and insufficient stability in real-world service environments. To overcome these limitations, a Practical Interlinked Concept Knowledge Tracing (PICKT) model that can effectively process multiple types of input data is proposed. Specifically, a knowledge map structures the relationships among concepts considering the question and concept text information, thereby enabling effective knowledge tracing even in cold start situations. Experiments reflecting real operational environments demonstrated the model's excellent performance and practicality. The main contributions of this research are as follows. First, a model architecture that effectively utilizes diverse data formats is presented. Second, significant performance improvements are achieved over existing models for two core cold start challenges: new student enrollment and new question addition. Third, the model's stability and practicality are validated through delicate experimental design, enhancing its applicability in real-world product environments. This provides a crucial theoretical and technical foundation for the practical implementation of next-generation ITS.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 17 tables.

| **[TIDE: Two-Stage Inverse Degradation Estimation with Guided Prior Disentanglement for Underwater Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07171v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater image restoration is essential for marine applications ranging from ecological monitoring to archaeological surveys, but effectively addressing the complex and spatially varying nature of underwater degradations remains a challenge. Existing methods typically apply uniform restoration strategies across the entire image, struggling to handle multiple co-occurring degradations that vary spatially and with water conditions. We introduce TIDE, a $\underline{t}$wo stage $\underline{i}$nverse $\underline{d}$egradation $\underline{e}$stimation framework that explicitly models degradation characteristics and applies targeted restoration through specialized prior decomposition. Our approach disentangles the restoration process into multiple specialized hypotheses that are adaptively fused based on local degradation patterns, followed by a progressive refinement stage that corrects residual artifacts. Specifically, TIDE decomposes underwater degradations into four key factors, namely color distortion, haze, detail loss, and noise, and designs restoration experts specialized for each. By generating specialized restoration hypotheses, TIDE balances competing degradation factors and produces natural results even in highly degraded regions. Extensive experiments across both standard benchmarks and challenging turbid water conditions show that TIDE achieves competitive performance on reference based fidelity metrics while outperforming state of the art methods on non reference perceptual quality metrics, with strong improvements in color correction and contrast enhancement.

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we propose DeepSVM, a physics-informed Deep Operator Network (PI-DeepONet) designed to learn the solution operator of the Heston model across its entire parameter space. Unlike standard data-driven deep learning (DL) approaches, DeepSVM requires no labelled training data. Rather, we employ a hard-constrained ansatz that enforces terminal payoffs and static no-arbitrage conditions by design. Furthermore, we use Residual-based Adaptive Refinement (RAR) to stabilize training in difficult regions subject to high gradients. Overall, DeepSVM achieves a final training loss of $10^{-5}$ and predicts highly accurate option prices across a range of typical market dynamics. While pricing accuracy is high, we find that the model's derivatives (Greeks) exhibit noise in the at-the-money (ATM) regime, highlighting the specific need for higher-order regularization in physics-informed operator learning.</p></details> |  |

ACE contains a hidden heldout set of 400 test cases, split across four consumer activities: shopping, food, gaming, and DIY. We are also open sourcing 80 cases as a devset with a CC-BY license. For the ACE leaderboard we evaluated 10 frontier models (with websearch turned on) using a novel grading methodology that dynamically checks whether relevant parts of the response are grounded in the retrieved web sources. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) is the top-performing model, scoring 56.1%, followed by o3 Pro (Thinking = On) at 55.2% and GPT 5.1 (Thinking = High) at 55.1%. Model scores differ across domains, and in Shopping the top model scores under 50\%. We find that models are prone to hallucinating key information, such as prices. ACE shows a substantial gap between the performance of even the best models and consumers' AI needs.</p></details> |  |

However, optimizing sensing strategies to balance spatial and temporal coverage, minimize redundancy, and address budget constraints remains a key challenge.This study proposes an adaptive framework for enhancing the sensing utility of sensor-equipped vehicles.By integrating heterogeneous open-source data, the framework leverages spatiotemporal weighting to optimize vehicle selection and sensing coverage across various urban contexts.An entropy-based vehicle selection strategy, \texttt{Improved OptiFleet}, is developed to maximize sensing utility while minimizing redundancy.The framework is validated using real-world air quality data from 320 sensor-equipped vehicles operating in Guangzhou, China, over two months.Key findings show that the proposed method outperforms baseline strategies, providing up to 5\% higher sensing utility with reduced fleet sizes, and also highlights the critical role of dynamic urban data in optimizing mobile sensing strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[PlantBiMoE: A Bidirectional Foundation Model with SparseMoE for Plant Genomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07113v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the underlying linguistic rules of plant genomes remains a fundamental challenge in computational biology. Recent advances including AgroNT and PDLLMs have made notable progress although, they suffer from excessive parameter size and limited ability to model the bidirectional nature of DNA strands respectively. To address these limitations, we propose PlantBiMoE, a lightweight and expressive plant genome language model that integrates bidirectional Mamba and a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SparseMoE) framework. The bidirectional Mamba enables the model to effectively capture structural dependencies across both the forward and reverse DNA strands, while SparseMoE significantly reduces the number of active parameters, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing modeling capacity. We evaluated and tested our model on the Modified Plants Genome Benchmark (MPGB), an enhanced genomic benchmark, which consolidates 31 datasets across 11 representative tasks, with input sequence lengths ranging from 50 to 6,000 bp. Experimental results demonstrate that PlantBiMoE achieves the best performance on 20 out of 31 datasets and the average best when comparing with existing models. In summary, all above results demonstrate that our model can effectively represent plant genomic sequences, serving as a robust computational tool for diverse genomic tasks, while making substantive contributions to plant genomics, gene editing, and synthetic biology.

This paper presents TagLabel, an RFID based system that determines both the orientation and contents of packages using low cost passive UHF tags. By analyzing how materials change RSSI and phase, the system identifies the contents of a package without opening it. Using orientation inferred from phase differences, tag occlusion, and antenna gain patterns, the system selects the tag with the greatest occlusion for accurate material sensing. We evaluate two and three tag configurations, and show that both can deliver high orientation and material sensing performance through the use of machine learning classifiers, even in realistic RF environments. When combined into a unified pipeline, TagLabel achieves more than 80 percent accuracy across all package orientations. Because it requires only standard RFID hardware and offers fast scanning times, this approach provides a practical way to enhance package inspection and improve automation in logistics operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

A structured questionnaire was administered to 22 FRs across eight countries, capturing their demographic profiles, general attitudes toward robots, and experiences with semantics-enhanced SA. Results show that most FRs expressed positive attitudes toward robots, and rated the usefulness of semantic information for building SA at an average of 3.6 out of 5. Semantic information was also valued for its role in predicting unforeseen emergencies (mean 3.9). Participants reported requiring an average of 74.6\% accuracy to trust semantic outputs and 67.8\% for them to be considered useful, revealing a willingness to use imperfect but informative AI support tools. To the best of our knowledge, this study offers novel insights by being one of the first to directly survey FRs on semantic-based SA in a cross-national context. It reveals the types of semantic information most valued in the field, such as object identity, spatial relationships, and risk context-and connects these preferences to the respondents' roles, experience, and education levels. The findings also expose a critical gap between lab-based robotics capabilities and the realities of field deployment, highlighting the need for more meaningful collaboration between FRs and robotics researchers. These insights contribute to the development of more user-aligned and situationally aware robotic systems for emergency response.</p></details> |  |

This study employed the TEMPEST multi-turn attack framework to evaluate ten frontier models from eight vendors across 1,000 harmful behaviors, generating over 97,000 API queries across adversarial conversations with automated evaluation by independent safety classifiers. Results demonstrated a spectrum of vulnerability: six models achieved 96% to 100% attack success rate (ASR), while four showed meaningful resistance, with ASR ranging from 42% to 78%; enabling extended reasoning on identical architecture reduced ASR from 97% to 42%. These findings indicate that safety alignment quality varies substantially across vendors, that model scale does not predict adversarial robustness, and that thinking mode provides a deployable safety enhancement. Collectively, this work establishes that current alignment techniques remain fundamentally vulnerable to adaptive multi-turn attacks regardless of model scale, while identifying deliberative inference as a promising defense direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Beam search decoder for quantum LDPC codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07057v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a decoder for quantum low density parity check (LDPC) codes based on a beam search heuristic guided by belief propagation (BP). Our beam search decoder applies to all quantum LDPC codes and achieves different speed-accuracy tradeoffs by tuning its parameters such as the beam width. We perform numerical simulations under circuit level noise for the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle (BB) code at noise rate $p=10^{-3}$ to estimate the logical error rate and the 99.9 percentile runtime and we compare with the BP-OSD decoder which has been the default quantum LDPC decoder for the past six years. A variant of our beam search decoder with a beam width of 64 achieves a $17\times$ reduction in logical error rate. With a beam width of 8, we reach the same logical error rate as BP-OSD with a $26.2\times$ reduction in the 99.9 percentile runtime. We identify the beam search decoder with beam width of 32 as a promising candidate for trapped ion architectures because it achieves a $5.6\times$ reduction in logical error rate with a 99.9 percentile runtime per syndrome extraction round below 1ms at $p=5 \times10^{-4}$. Remarkably, this is achieved in software on a single core, without any parallelization or specialized hardware (FPGA, ASIC), suggesting one might only need three 32-core CPUs to decode a trapped ion quantum computer with 1000 logical qubits.</p></details> |  |

Here we show that next-token prediction is provably powerful for learning longer-range structure, even with common neural network architectures. Specifically, we prove that optimizing next-token prediction over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) yields a model that closely approximates the training distribution: for held-out documents sampled from the training distribution, no algorithm of bounded description length limited to examining the next $k$ tokens, for any $k$, can distinguish between $k$ consecutive tokens of such documents and $k$ tokens generated by the learned language model following the same prefix. We provide polynomial bounds (in $k$, independent of the document length) on the model size needed to achieve such $k$-token indistinguishability, offering a complexity-theoretic explanation for the long-range coherence observed in practice.</p></details> | 66 pages, 5 figures |

In this review, we examine the current state of the art in pHHI through three core pillars: (i) humanoid modeling and control, (ii) human intent estimation, and (iii) computational human models. For each pillar, we survey representative approaches, identify open challenges, and analyze current limitations that hinder robust, scalable, and adaptive interaction. These include the need for whole-body control strategies capable of handling uncertain human dynamics, real-time intent inference under limited sensing, and modeling techniques that account for variability in human physical states. Although significant progress has been made within each domain, integration across pillars remains limited. We propose pathways for unifying methods across these areas to enable cohesive interaction frameworks. This structure enables us not only to map the current landscape but also to propose concrete directions for future research that aim to bridge these domains. Additionally, we introduce a unified taxonomy of interaction types based on modality, distinguishing between direct interactions (e.g., physical contact) and indirect interactions (e.g., object-mediated), and on the level of robot engagement, ranging from assistance to cooperation and collaboration. For each category in this taxonomy, we provide the three core pillars that highlight opportunities for cross-pillar unification. Our goal is to suggest avenues to advance robust, safe, and intuitive physical interaction, providing a roadmap for future research that will allow humanoid systems to effectively understand, anticipate, and collaborate with human partners in diverse real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Optimization-Guided Diffusion for Interactive Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07661v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic and diverse multi-agent driving scenes are crucial for evaluating autonomous vehicles, but safety-critical events which are essential for this task are rare and underrepresented in driving datasets. Data-driven scene generation offers a low-cost alternative by synthesizing complex traffic behaviors from existing driving logs. However, existing models often lack controllability or yield samples that violate physical or social constraints, limiting their usability. We present OMEGA, an optimization-guided, training-free framework that enforces structural consistency and interaction awareness during diffusion-based sampling from a scene generation model. OMEGA re-anchors each reverse diffusion step via constrained optimization, steering the generation towards physically plausible and behaviorally coherent trajectories. Building on this framework, we formulate ego-attacker interactions as a game-theoretic optimization in the distribution space, approximating Nash equilibria to generate realistic, safety-critical adversarial scenarios. Experiments on nuPlan and Waymo show that OMEGA improves generation realism, consistency, and controllability, increasing the ratio of physically and behaviorally valid scenes from 32.35% to 72.27% for free exploration capabilities, and from 11% to 80% for controllability-focused generation. Our approach can also generate $5\times$ more near-collision frames with a time-to-collision under three seconds while maintaining the overall scene realism.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances leverage Large Language Model (LLM) for sequential modeling, existing LLM-based approaches face two key limitations: (i) strong reliance on the contextual completeness of user histories, resulting in poor performance on out-of-history (OOH) scenarios; (ii) limited scalability, due to the restricted context window of LLMs, which limits their ability to access and process a large number of candidate POIs. To address these challenges, we propose Tool4POI, a novel tool-augmented framework that enables LLMs to perform open-set POI recommendation through external retrieval and reasoning. Tool4POI consists of three key modules: preference extraction module, multi-turn candidate retrieval module, and reranking module, which together summarize long-term user interests, interact with external tools to retrieve relevant POIs, and refine final recommendations based on recent behaviors. Unlike existing methods, Tool4POI requires no task-specific fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that Tool4POI substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 40% accuracy on challenging OOH scenarios where existing methods fail, and delivering average improvements of 20% and 30% on Acc@5 and Acc@10, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cri...</summary><p>A critical technical error was discovered during our internal review, leading to unreliable experimental results.

In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Article (14 Pages, 3 Figures), Appendix (5 Pages) Accepted for presentation at SIAM PP26</p></details> |

We develop a dedicated rule-based procedure for computing these generalizations, prove its termination, soundness, and completeness, extend it modulo equational theories, and integrate it into a standard anti-unification framework. A prototype tool demonstrates the approach's ability to recompose global interactions from partial views.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (21 in the article, 5 pages in appendices), 7 figures, 6 tables, submitted to Formal Methods 2026 (FM 2026)</p></details> |

These compact motion priors enable a new approach to ultra-low bitrate communication while achieving high-quality reconstruction across diverse scene contents. At the encoder side, motion priors can be streamlined into compact representations via a dense-to-sparse transformation. At the decoder side, these priors facilitate the reconstruction of scene dynamics using an advanced flow-driven diffusion model. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion-performance and outperform the state-of-the-art conventional-video codec Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) on-scene dynamics sequences.

It covers an introduction to machine learning and describes various theoretical advances and practical projects in the field. The Lecture here is presented in its original format, but a few remarks have been added in 2025 to reflect recent developments, and the list of references has been updated to enhance the convenience and accuracy for readers. When did machine learning start? Maybe a good starting point is 1949, when Claude Shannon proposed a learning algorithm for chess-playing programs. Or maybe we should go back to the 1930s when Ronald Fisher developed discriminant analysis - a type of learning where the problem is to construct a decision rule that separates two types of vectors. Or could it be the 18th century when David Hume discussed the idea of induction? Or the 14th century, when William of Ockham formulated the principle of "simplicity" known as "Ockham's razor" (Ockham, by the way, is a small village not far from Royal Holloway). Or it may be that, like almost everything else in Western civilisation and culture, the origin of these ideas lies in the Mediterranean. After all, it was Aristotle who said that "we learn some things only by doing things". The field of machine learning has been greatly influenced by other disciplines and the subject is in itself not a very homogeneous discipline, but includes separate, overlapping subfields. There are many parallel lines of research in ML: inductive learning, neural networks, clustering, and theories of learning. They are all part of the more general field of machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inaug...</summary><p>Inaugural Lecture. 18 pages, 13 figures, Published in 1997 by Royal Holloway, University of London, ISBN 0 900145 93 5</p></details> |

It has recently been shown that predefined vector systems, specifically An root system vectors, can be used as targets for latent space configurations (LSC) to ensure the desired LS structure. One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training. It is also shown that using the minimum number of LS dimensions for a specific number of classes results in faster convergence. The latter has potential advantages for reducing the size of vector databases used to store NN embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 4 equations</p></details> |

Yet, emerging and disruptive technologies are reshaping the landscape of nuclear risks, presenting a critical juncture for decision makers. This article lays out the contours of an overlooked but intensifying technological arms race for nuclear (in)visibility, driven by the interplay between proliferation-enabling technologies (PETs) and detection-enhancing technologies (DETs). We argue that the strategic pattern of proliferation will be increasingly shaped by the innovation pace in these domains. Artificial intelligence (AI) introduces unprecedented complexity to this equation, as its rapid scaling and knowledge substitution capabilities accelerate PET development and challenge traditional monitoring and verification methods. To analyze this dynamic, we develop a formal model centered on a Relative Advantage Index (RAI), quantifying the shifting balance between PETs and DETs. Our model explores how asymmetric technological advancement, particularly logistic AI-driven PET growth versus stepwise DET improvements, expands the band of uncertainty surrounding proliferation detectability. Through replicable scenario-based simulations, we evaluate the impact of varying PET growth rates and DET investment strategies on cumulative nuclear breakout risk. We identify a strategic fork ahead, where detection may no longer suffice without broader PET governance. Governments and international organizations should accordingly invest in policies and tools agile enough to keep pace with tomorrow's technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best Paper Award (2025) from Risk Analysis as one of the articles published in the journal that year with the most significant impacts to the theory or practice of risk analysis.

The language of a pattern is the set of words obtained by uniformly substituting all variables with words that contain only terminals. In their original definition, patterns only allow for multiple distinct occurrences of some variables to be related by the equality relation, represented by using the same variable multiple times. In an extended notion, called relational patterns and relational pattern languages, variables may be related by arbitrary other relations.

It is shown show that - even for many much simpler or less restrictive relations - the complexity and (un)decidability characteristics of these problems do not change compared to the classical case where variables are related only by equality.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages (incl. appendix and references), 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Living the Novel: A System for Generating Self-Training Timeline-Aware Conversational Agents from Novels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07474v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the Living Novel, an end-to-end system that transforms any literary work into an immersive, multi-character conversational experience. This system is designed to solve two fundamental challenges for LLM-driven characters. Firstly, generic LLMs suffer from persona drift, often failing to stay in character. Secondly, agents often exhibit abilities that extend beyond the constraints of the story's world and logic, leading to both narrative incoherence (spoiler leakage) and robustness failures (frame-breaking). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage training pipeline. Our Deep Persona Alignment (DPA) stage uses data-free reinforcement finetuning to instill deep character fidelity. Our Coherence and Robustness Enhancing (CRE) stage then employs a story-time-aware knowledge graph and a second retrieval-grounded training pass to architecturally enforce these narrative constraints. We validate our system through a multi-phase evaluation using Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. A lab study with a detailed ablation of system components is followed by a 5-day in-the-wild diary study. Our DPA pipeline helps our specialized model outperform GPT-4o on persona-specific metrics, and our CRE stage achieves near-perfect performance in coherence and robustness measures. Our study surfaces practical design guidelines for AI-driven narrative systems: we find that character-first self-training is foundational for believability, while explicit story-time constraints are crucial for sustaining coherent, interruption-resilient mobile-web experiences.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a workflow for transforming such documents into structured data using a combination of multimodal large language models (LLMs), an ontology-based reasoning model, and a custom extension of the Linked Art framework. We show how vision-language models can accurately parse and transcribe born-digital and digitised programmes, achieving over 98% of correct extraction. To overcome the challenges of semantic annotation, we train a reasoning model (POntAvignon) using reinforcement learning with both formal and semantic rewards. This approach enables automated RDF triple generation and supports alignment with existing knowledge graphs. Through a case study based on the Festival d'Avignon corpus, we demonstrate the potential for large-scale, ontology-driven analysis of performing arts data. Our results open new possibilities for interoperable, explainable, and sustainable computational theatre historiography.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, 17 references</p></details> |

While existing smart beehive systems monitor internal conditions, they typically overlook external environmental factors that significantly influence colony health, and are constrained by high cost, limited scalability, and inadequate contextual analysis. We present WaggleNet, a novel dual-scope monitoring system that simultaneously captures both internal hive conditions and external environmental parameters using a cost-effective LoRa-MQTT architecture. Our system deploys modular worker nodes ($\sim$\$15 each) equipped with temperature, humidity, light, and GPS sensors both inside and around beehives. A master node functions as a LoRa-MQTT gateway, forwarding data to a cloud server with a mobile application interface. Field experiments confirmed reliable operation with 100\% packet delivery over 110 meters in line-of-sight conditions and 95 meters in obstructed environments, including successful deployment inside wooden hive structures. Our system demonstrated stable end-to-end latency under 5 seconds and continuous operation over a two-month period across diverse environmental conditions. By bridging the gap between internal and external monitoring, WaggleNet enables contextual anomaly detection and supports data-driven precision beekeeping in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

| **[Debiasing Diffusion Priors via 3D Attention for Consistent Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07345v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Versatile 3D tasks (e.g., generation or editing) that distill from Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have attracted significant research interest for not relying on extensive 3D training data. However, T2I models exhibit limitations resulting from prior view bias, which produces conflicting appearances between different views of an object. This bias causes subject-words to preferentially activate prior view features during cross-attention (CA) computation, regardless of the target view condition. To overcome this limitation, we conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis to reveal the root cause of the prior view bias in T2I models. Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians. Notably, HAM facilitates semantic-specific interventions, enabling controllable and precise 3D editing. Extensive experiments firmly establish that TD-Attn has the potential to serve as a universal plugin, significantly enhancing multi-view consistency across 3D tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, 2 algorithms, Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Expectation-Maximization as the Engine of Scalable Medical Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03410v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large, high-quality, annotated datasets are the foundation of medical AI research, but constructing even a small, moderate-quality, annotated dataset can take years of effort from multidisciplinary teams. Although active learning can prioritize what to annotate, scaling up still requires extensive manual efforts to revise the noisy annotations. We formulate this as a missing-data problem and develop ScaleMAI, a framework that unifies data annotation and model development co-evolution through an Expectation-Maximization (EM) process. In this iterative process, the AI model automatically identifies and corrects the mistakes in annotations (Expectation), while the refined annotated data retrain the model to improve accuracy (Maximization). In addition to the classical EM algorithm, ScaleMAI brings human experts into the loop to review annotations that cannot be adequately addressed by either Expectation or Maximization step (<5%). As a result, ScaleMAI progressively creates an annotated dataset of 47,315 CT scans (4.8x larger than the largest public dataset, PanTS) including 4,163,720 per-voxel annotations for benign/malignant tumors and 88 anatomical structures. ScaleMAI iteratively trains a model that exceeds human expert performance in tumor diagnosis (+7%), and outperforms models developed from smaller, moderate-quality datasets, with statistically significant gains in tumor detection (+10%) and segmentation (+14%) on two prestigious benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient ASR for Low-Resource Languages: Leveraging Cross-Lingual Unlabeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07277v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic speech recognition for low-resource languages remains fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and computational resources required by state-of-the-art models. We present a systematic investigation into cross-lingual continuous pretraining for low-resource languages, using Perso-Arabic languages (Persian, Arabic, and Urdu) as our primary case study. Our approach demonstrates that strategic utilization of unlabeled speech data can effectively bridge the resource gap without sacrificing recognition accuracy. We construct a 3,000-hour multilingual corpus through a scalable unlabeled data collection pipeline and employ targeted continual pretraining combined with morphologically-aware tokenization to develop a 300M parameter model that achieves performance comparable to systems 5 times larger. Our model outperforms Whisper Large v3 (1.5B parameters) on Persian and achieves competitive results on Arabic and Urdu despite using significantly fewer parameters and substantially less labeled data. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that ASR quality scales primarily with model size, revealing instead that data relevance and strategic pretraining are more critical factors for low-resource scenarios. This work provides a practical pathway toward inclusive speech technology, enabling effective ASR for underrepresented languages without dependence on massive computational infrastructure or proprietary datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AACL IJCNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-platform Product Matching Based on Entity Alignment of Knowledge Graph with RAEA model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07232v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Product matching aims to identify identical or similar products sold on different platforms. By building knowledge graphs (KGs), the product matching problem can be converted to the Entity Alignment (EA) task, which aims to discover the equivalent entities from diverse KGs. The existing EA methods inadequately utilize both attribute triples and relation triples simultaneously, especially the interactions between them. This paper introduces a two-stage pipeline consisting of rough filter and fine filter to match products from eBay and Amazon. For fine filtering, a new framework for Entity Alignment, Relation-aware and Attribute-aware Graph Attention Networks for Entity Alignment (RAEA), is employed. RAEA focuses on the interactions between attribute triples and relation triples, where the entity representation aggregates the alignment signals from attributes and relations with Attribute-aware Entity Encoder and Relation-aware Graph Attention Networks. The experimental results indicate that the RAEA model achieves significant improvements over 12 baselines on EA task in the cross-lingual dataset DBP15K (6.59% on average Hits@1) and delivers competitive results in the monolingual dataset DWY100K. The source code for experiments on DBP15K and DWY100K is available at github (https://github.com/Mockingjay-liu/RAEA-model-for-Entity-Alignment).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, published on World Wide Web</p></details> |

However, a single estimate cannot capture pose uncertainty deriving from visual ambiguity, which can lead to unreliable behavior. Existing pose distribution methods rely heavily on color information, often unavailable in industrial settings. We propose a novel neural network-based method for estimating object pose uncertainty using only 3D colorless data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that leverages deep learning for pose distribution estimation without relying on RGB input. We validate our method in a real-world bin picking scenario with objects of varying geometric ambiguity. Our current implementation focuses on symmetries in reflection and revolution, but the framework is extendable to full SE(3) pose distribution estimation.

This difficulty stems primarily from the high memory demands of maintaining accurate spike-timing logs and the potential for purely local plasticity adjustments to clash with the supervised learning goal. To effectively leverage local signals derived from spiking neuron dynamics, we introduce Dopamine-Modulated Spike-Synchrony-Dependent Plasticity (DA-SSDP), a synchrony-based rule that is sensitive to loss and brings a synchrony-based local learning signal to the model. DA-SSDP condenses spike patterns into a synchrony metric at the batch level. An initial brief warm-up phase assesses its relationship to the task loss and sets a fixed gate that subsequently adjusts the local update's magnitude. In cases where synchrony proves unrelated to the task, the gate settles at one, simplifying DA-SSDP to a basic two-factor synchrony mechanism that delivers minor weight adjustments driven by concurrent spike firing and a Gaussian latency function. These small weight updates are only added to the network`s deeper layers following the backpropagation phase, and our tests showed this simplified version did not degrade performance and sometimes gave a small accuracy boost, serving as a regularizer during training. The rule stores only binary spike indicators and first-spike latencies with a Gaussian kernel. Without altering the model structure or optimization routine, evaluations on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (+0.42\%), CIFAR-100 (+0.99\%), CIFAR10-DVS (+0.1\%), and ImageNet-1K (+0.73\%) demonstrated consistent accuracy gains, accompanied by a minor increase in computational overhead.

This paper focuses on the core technology of Knowledge Tracing (KT) models that analyze students' sequences of interactions to predict their knowledge acquisition levels. However, existing KT models suffer from limitations such as restricted input data formats, cold start problems arising with new student enrollment or new question addition, and insufficient stability in real-world service environments. To overcome these limitations, a Practical Interlinked Concept Knowledge Tracing (PICKT) model that can effectively process multiple types of input data is proposed. Specifically, a knowledge map structures the relationships among concepts considering the question and concept text information, thereby enabling effective knowledge tracing even in cold start situations. Experiments reflecting real operational environments demonstrated the model's excellent performance and practicality. The main contributions of this research are as follows. First, a model architecture that effectively utilizes diverse data formats is presented. Second, significant performance improvements are achieved over existing models for two core cold start challenges: new student enrollment and new question addition. Third, the model's stability and practicality are validated through delicate experimental design, enhancing its applicability in real-world product environments. This provides a crucial theoretical and technical foundation for the practical implementation of next-generation ITS.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 17 tables.

| **[TIDE: Two-Stage Inverse Degradation Estimation with Guided Prior Disentanglement for Underwater Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07171v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater image restoration is essential for marine applications ranging from ecological monitoring to archaeological surveys, but effectively addressing the complex and spatially varying nature of underwater degradations remains a challenge. Existing methods typically apply uniform restoration strategies across the entire image, struggling to handle multiple co-occurring degradations that vary spatially and with water conditions. We introduce TIDE, a $\underline{t}$wo stage $\underline{i}$nverse $\underline{d}$egradation $\underline{e}$stimation framework that explicitly models degradation characteristics and applies targeted restoration through specialized prior decomposition. Our approach disentangles the restoration process into multiple specialized hypotheses that are adaptively fused based on local degradation patterns, followed by a progressive refinement stage that corrects residual artifacts. Specifically, TIDE decomposes underwater degradations into four key factors, namely color distortion, haze, detail loss, and noise, and designs restoration experts specialized for each. By generating specialized restoration hypotheses, TIDE balances competing degradation factors and produces natural results even in highly degraded regions. Extensive experiments across both standard benchmarks and challenging turbid water conditions show that TIDE achieves competitive performance on reference based fidelity metrics while outperforming state of the art methods on non reference perceptual quality metrics, with strong improvements in color correction and contrast enhancement.

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we propose DeepSVM, a physics-informed Deep Operator Network (PI-DeepONet) designed to learn the solution operator of the Heston model across its entire parameter space. Unlike standard data-driven deep learning (DL) approaches, DeepSVM requires no labelled training data. Rather, we employ a hard-constrained ansatz that enforces terminal payoffs and static no-arbitrage conditions by design. Furthermore, we use Residual-based Adaptive Refinement (RAR) to stabilize training in difficult regions subject to high gradients. Overall, DeepSVM achieves a final training loss of $10^{-5}$ and predicts highly accurate option prices across a range of typical market dynamics. While pricing accuracy is high, we find that the model's derivatives (Greeks) exhibit noise in the at-the-money (ATM) regime, highlighting the specific need for higher-order regularization in physics-informed operator learning.</p></details> |  |

ACE contains a hidden heldout set of 400 test cases, split across four consumer activities: shopping, food, gaming, and DIY. We are also open sourcing 80 cases as a devset with a CC-BY license. For the ACE leaderboard we evaluated 10 frontier models (with websearch turned on) using a novel grading methodology that dynamically checks whether relevant parts of the response are grounded in the retrieved web sources. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) is the top-performing model, scoring 56.1%, followed by o3 Pro (Thinking = On) at 55.2% and GPT 5.1 (Thinking = High) at 55.1%. Model scores differ across domains, and in Shopping the top model scores under 50\%. We find that models are prone to hallucinating key information, such as prices.

However, optimizing sensing strategies to balance spatial and temporal coverage, minimize redundancy, and address budget constraints remains a key challenge.This study proposes an adaptive framework for enhancing the sensing utility of sensor-equipped vehicles.By integrating heterogeneous open-source data, the framework leverages spatiotemporal weighting to optimize vehicle selection and sensing coverage across various urban contexts.An entropy-based vehicle selection strategy, \texttt{Improved OptiFleet}, is developed to maximize sensing utility while minimizing redundancy.The framework is validated using real-world air quality data from 320 sensor-equipped vehicles operating in Guangzhou, China, over two months.Key findings show that the proposed method outperforms baseline strategies, providing up to 5\% higher sensing utility with reduced fleet sizes, and also highlights the critical role of dynamic urban data in optimizing mobile sensing strategies.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances including AgroNT and PDLLMs have made notable progress although, they suffer from excessive parameter size and limited ability to model the bidirectional nature of DNA strands respectively. To address these limitations, we propose PlantBiMoE, a lightweight and expressive plant genome language model that integrates bidirectional Mamba and a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SparseMoE) framework. The bidirectional Mamba enables the model to effectively capture structural dependencies across both the forward and reverse DNA strands, while SparseMoE significantly reduces the number of active parameters, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing modeling capacity. We evaluated and tested our model on the Modified Plants Genome Benchmark (MPGB), an enhanced genomic benchmark, which consolidates 31 datasets across 11 representative tasks, with input sequence lengths ranging from 50 to 6,000 bp. Experimental results demonstrate that PlantBiMoE achieves the best performance on 20 out of 31 datasets and the average best when comparing with existing models. In summary, all above results demonstrate that our model can effectively represent plant genomic sequences, serving as a robust computational tool for diverse genomic tasks, while making substantive contributions to plant genomics, gene editing, and synthetic biology.

This paper presents TagLabel, an RFID based system that determines both the orientation and contents of packages using low cost passive UHF tags. By analyzing how materials change RSSI and phase, the system identifies the contents of a package without opening it. Using orientation inferred from phase differences, tag occlusion, and antenna gain patterns, the system selects the tag with the greatest occlusion for accurate material sensing. We evaluate two and three tag configurations, and show that both can deliver high orientation and material sensing performance through the use of machine learning classifiers, even in realistic RF environments. When combined into a unified pipeline, TagLabel achieves more than 80 percent accuracy across all package orientations. Because it requires only standard RFID hardware and offers fast scanning times, this approach provides a practical way to enhance package inspection and improve automation in logistics operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

A structured questionnaire was administered to 22 FRs across eight countries, capturing their demographic profiles, general attitudes toward robots, and experiences with semantics-enhanced SA. Results show that most FRs expressed positive attitudes toward robots, and rated the usefulness of semantic information for building SA at an average of 3.6 out of 5. Semantic information was also valued for its role in predicting unforeseen emergencies (mean 3.9). Participants reported requiring an average of 74.6\% accuracy to trust semantic outputs and 67.8\% for them to be considered useful, revealing a willingness to use imperfect but informative AI support tools. To the best of our knowledge, this study offers novel insights by being one of the first to directly survey FRs on semantic-based SA in a cross-national context. It reveals the types of semantic information most valued in the field, such as object identity, spatial relationships, and risk context-and connects these preferences to the respondents' roles, experience, and education levels. The findings also expose a critical gap between lab-based robotics capabilities and the realities of field deployment, highlighting the need for more meaningful collaboration between FRs and robotics researchers. These insights contribute to the development of more user-aligned and situationally aware robotic systems for emergency response.</p></details> |  |

This study employed the TEMPEST multi-turn attack framework to evaluate ten frontier models from eight vendors across 1,000 harmful behaviors, generating over 97,000 API queries across adversarial conversations with automated evaluation by independent safety classifiers. Results demonstrated a spectrum of vulnerability: six models achieved 96% to 100% attack success rate (ASR), while four showed meaningful resistance, with ASR ranging from 42% to 78%; enabling extended reasoning on identical architecture reduced ASR from 97% to 42%. These findings indicate that safety alignment quality varies substantially across vendors, that model scale does not predict adversarial robustness, and that thinking mode provides a deployable safety enhancement. Collectively, this work establishes that current alignment techniques remain fundamentally vulnerable to adaptive multi-turn attacks regardless of model scale, while identifying deliberative inference as a promising defense direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

Our beam search decoder applies to all quantum LDPC codes and achieves different speed-accuracy tradeoffs by tuning its parameters such as the beam width. We perform numerical simulations under circuit level noise for the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle (BB) code at noise rate $p=10^{-3}$ to estimate the logical error rate and the 99.9 percentile runtime and we compare with the BP-OSD decoder which has been the default quantum LDPC decoder for the past six years. A variant of our beam search decoder with a beam width of 64 achieves a $17\times$ reduction in logical error rate. With a beam width of 8, we reach the same logical error rate as BP-OSD with a $26.2\times$ reduction in the 99.9 percentile runtime. We identify the beam search decoder with beam width of 32 as a promising candidate for trapped ion architectures because it achieves a $5.6\times$ reduction in logical error rate with a 99.9 percentile runtime per syndrome extraction round below 1ms at $p=5 \times10^{-4}$. Remarkably, this is achieved in software on a single core, without any parallelization or specialized hardware (FPGA, ASIC), suggesting one might only need three 32-core CPUs to decode a trapped ion quantum computer with 1000 logical qubits.</p></details> |  |

Here we show that next-token prediction is provably powerful for learning longer-range structure, even with common neural network architectures. Specifically, we prove that optimizing next-token prediction over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) yields a model that closely approximates the training distribution: for held-out documents sampled from the training distribution, no algorithm of bounded description length limited to examining the next $k$ tokens, for any $k$, can distinguish between $k$ consecutive tokens of such documents and $k$ tokens generated by the learned language model following the same prefix. We provide polynomial bounds (in $k$, independent of the document length) on the model size needed to achieve such $k$-token indistinguishability, offering a complexity-theoretic explanation for the long-range coherence observed in practice.</p></details> | 66 pages, 5 figures |

Drawing on the idea of ``looking broader to see the whole, looking finer to see the details," MVP is built on two core design principles: 1) a local-to-global inter-view hierarchy that gradually broadens the model's perspective from local views to groups and ultimately the full scene, and 2) a fine-to-coarse intra-view hierarchy that starts from detailed spatial representations and progressively aggregates them into compact, information-dense tokens. This dual hierarchy achieves both computational efficiency and representational richness, enabling fast reconstruction of large and complex scenes. We validate MVP on diverse datasets and show that, when coupled with 3D Gaussian Splatting as the underlying 3D representation, it achieves state-of-the-art generalizable reconstruction quality while maintaining high efficiency and scalability across a wide range of view configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: see https://gynjn.github.io/MVP/</p></details> |

In this review, we examine the current state of the art in pHHI through three core pillars: (i) humanoid modeling and control, (ii) human intent estimation, and (iii) computational human models. For each pillar, we survey representative approaches, identify open challenges, and analyze current limitations that hinder robust, scalable, and adaptive interaction. These include the need for whole-body control strategies capable of handling uncertain human dynamics, real-time intent inference under limited sensing, and modeling techniques that account for variability in human physical states. Although significant progress has been made within each domain, integration across pillars remains limited. We propose pathways for unifying methods across these areas to enable cohesive interaction frameworks. This structure enables us not only to map the current landscape but also to propose concrete directions for future research that aim to bridge these domains. Additionally, we introduce a unified taxonomy of interaction types based on modality, distinguishing between direct interactions (e.g., physical contact) and indirect interactions (e.g., object-mediated), and on the level of robot engagement, ranging from assistance to cooperation and collaboration. For each category in this taxonomy, we provide the three core pillars that highlight opportunities for cross-pillar unification. Our goal is to suggest avenues to advance robust, safe, and intuitive physical interaction, providing a roadmap for future research that will allow humanoid systems to effectively understand, anticipate, and collaborate with human partners in diverse real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

TranSplat is based on a theoretical radiance transfer identity for cross-scene relighting of objects with radially symmetric BRDFs that involves only taking simple products of spherical harmonic appearance coefficients of the object, source, and target environment maps without any explicit computation of scene quantities (e.g., the BRDFs themselves). TranSplat is the first method to demonstrate how this theoretical identity may be used to perform relighting within the GS framework, and furthermore, by automatically inferring unknown source and target environment maps directly from the source and target scene GS representations. We evaluated TranSplat on several synthetic and real-world scenes and objects, demonstrating comparable 3D object relighting performance to recent conventional inverse rendering-based GS methods with a fraction of their runtime. While TranSplat is theoretically best-suited for radially symmetric BRDFs, results demonstrate that TranSplat still offers perceptually realistic renderings on real scenes and opens a valuable, lightweight path forward to relighting with the GS framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimization-Guided Diffusion for Interactive Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07661v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic and diverse multi-agent driving scenes are crucial for evaluating autonomous vehicles, but safety-critical events which are essential for this task are rare and underrepresented in driving datasets. Data-driven scene generation offers a low-cost alternative by synthesizing complex traffic behaviors from existing driving logs. However, existing models often lack controllability or yield samples that violate physical or social constraints, limiting their usability. We present OMEGA, an optimization-guided, training-free framework that enforces structural consistency and interaction awareness during diffusion-based sampling from a scene generation model. OMEGA re-anchors each reverse diffusion step via constrained optimization, steering the generation towards physically plausible and behaviorally coherent trajectories. Building on this framework, we formulate ego-attacker interactions as a game-theoretic optimization in the distribution space, approximating Nash equilibria to generate realistic, safety-critical adversarial scenarios. Experiments on nuPlan and Waymo show that OMEGA improves generation realism, consistency, and controllability, increasing the ratio of physically and behaviorally valid scenes from 32.35% to 72.27% for free exploration capabilities, and from 11% to 80% for controllability-focused generation. Our approach can also generate $5\times$ more near-collision frames with a time-to-collision under three seconds while maintaining the overall scene realism.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances leverage Large Language Model (LLM) for sequential modeling, existing LLM-based approaches face two key limitations: (i) strong reliance on the contextual completeness of user histories, resulting in poor performance on out-of-history (OOH) scenarios; (ii) limited scalability, due to the restricted context window of LLMs, which limits their ability to access and process a large number of candidate POIs. To address these challenges, we propose Tool4POI, a novel tool-augmented framework that enables LLMs to perform open-set POI recommendation through external retrieval and reasoning. Tool4POI consists of three key modules: preference extraction module, multi-turn candidate retrieval module, and reranking module, which together summarize long-term user interests, interact with external tools to retrieve relevant POIs, and refine final recommendations based on recent behaviors. Unlike existing methods, Tool4POI requires no task-specific fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that Tool4POI substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 40% accuracy on challenging OOH scenarios where existing methods fail, and delivering average improvements of 20% and 30% on Acc@5 and Acc@10, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cri...</summary><p>A critical technical error was discovered during our internal review, leading to unreliable experimental results.

In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Article (14 Pages, 3 Figures), Appendix (5 Pages) Accepted for presentation at SIAM PP26</p></details> |

We develop a dedicated rule-based procedure for computing these generalizations, prove its termination, soundness, and completeness, extend it modulo equational theories, and integrate it into a standard anti-unification framework. A prototype tool demonstrates the approach's ability to recompose global interactions from partial views.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (21 in the article, 5 pages in appendices), 7 figures, 6 tables, submitted to Formal Methods 2026 (FM 2026)</p></details> |

These compact motion priors enable a new approach to ultra-low bitrate communication while achieving high-quality reconstruction across diverse scene contents. At the encoder side, motion priors can be streamlined into compact representations via a dense-to-sparse transformation. At the decoder side, these priors facilitate the reconstruction of scene dynamics using an advanced flow-driven diffusion model. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion-performance and outperform the state-of-the-art conventional-video codec Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) on-scene dynamics sequences.

It covers an introduction to machine learning and describes various theoretical advances and practical projects in the field. The Lecture here is presented in its original format, but a few remarks have been added in 2025 to reflect recent developments, and the list of references has been updated to enhance the convenience and accuracy for readers. When did machine learning start? Maybe a good starting point is 1949, when Claude Shannon proposed a learning algorithm for chess-playing programs. Or maybe we should go back to the 1930s when Ronald Fisher developed discriminant analysis - a type of learning where the problem is to construct a decision rule that separates two types of vectors. Or could it be the 18th century when David Hume discussed the idea of induction? Or the 14th century, when William of Ockham formulated the principle of "simplicity" known as "Ockham's razor" (Ockham, by the way, is a small village not far from Royal Holloway). Or it may be that, like almost everything else in Western civilisation and culture, the origin of these ideas lies in the Mediterranean. After all, it was Aristotle who said that "we learn some things only by doing things". The field of machine learning has been greatly influenced by other disciplines and the subject is in itself not a very homogeneous discipline, but includes separate, overlapping subfields. There are many parallel lines of research in ML: inductive learning, neural networks, clustering, and theories of learning. They are all part of the more general field of machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inaug...</summary><p>Inaugural Lecture. 18 pages, 13 figures, Published in 1997 by Royal Holloway, University of London, ISBN 0 900145 93 5</p></details> |
| **[Exploring possible vector systems for faster training of neural networks with preconfigured latent spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07509v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The overall neural network (NN) performance is closely related to the properties of its embedding distribution in latent space (LS). It has recently been shown that predefined vector systems, specifically An root system vectors, can be used as targets for latent space configurations (LSC) to ensure the desired LS structure. One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training. It is also shown that using the minimum number of LS dimensions for a specific number of classes results in faster convergence. The latter has potential advantages for reducing the size of vector databases used to store NN embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 4 equations</p></details> |

Yet, emerging and disruptive technologies are reshaping the landscape of nuclear risks, presenting a critical juncture for decision makers. This article lays out the contours of an overlooked but intensifying technological arms race for nuclear (in)visibility, driven by the interplay between proliferation-enabling technologies (PETs) and detection-enhancing technologies (DETs). We argue that the strategic pattern of proliferation will be increasingly shaped by the innovation pace in these domains. Artificial intelligence (AI) introduces unprecedented complexity to this equation, as its rapid scaling and knowledge substitution capabilities accelerate PET development and challenge traditional monitoring and verification methods. To analyze this dynamic, we develop a formal model centered on a Relative Advantage Index (RAI), quantifying the shifting balance between PETs and DETs. Our model explores how asymmetric technological advancement, particularly logistic AI-driven PET growth versus stepwise DET improvements, expands the band of uncertainty surrounding proliferation detectability. Through replicable scenario-based simulations, we evaluate the impact of varying PET growth rates and DET investment strategies on cumulative nuclear breakout risk. We identify a strategic fork ahead, where detection may no longer suffice without broader PET governance. Governments and international organizations should accordingly invest in policies and tools agile enough to keep pace with tomorrow's technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best Paper Award (2025) from Risk Analysis as one of the articles published in the journal that year with the most significant impacts to the theory or practice of risk analysis.

The language of a pattern is the set of words obtained by uniformly substituting all variables with words that contain only terminals. In their original definition, patterns only allow for multiple distinct occurrences of some variables to be related by the equality relation, represented by using the same variable multiple times. In an extended notion, called relational patterns and relational pattern languages, variables may be related by arbitrary other relations. We extend the ongoing investigation of the main decision problems for patterns (namely, the membership problem, the inclusion problem, and the equivalence problem) to relational pattern languages under a wide range of individual relations. It is shown show that - even for many much simpler or less restrictive relations - the complexity and (un)decidability characteristics of these problems do not change compared to the classical case where variables are related only by equality.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages (incl. appendix and references), 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Living the Novel: A System for Generating Self-Training Timeline-Aware Conversational Agents from Novels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07474v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the Living Novel, an end-to-end system that transforms any literary work into an immersive, multi-character conversational experience. This system is designed to solve two fundamental challenges for LLM-driven characters. Firstly, generic LLMs suffer from persona drift, often failing to stay in character. Secondly, agents often exhibit abilities that extend beyond the constraints of the story's world and logic, leading to both narrative incoherence (spoiler leakage) and robustness failures (frame-breaking). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage training pipeline. Our Deep Persona Alignment (DPA) stage uses data-free reinforcement finetuning to instill deep character fidelity. Our Coherence and Robustness Enhancing (CRE) stage then employs a story-time-aware knowledge graph and a second retrieval-grounded training pass to architecturally enforce these narrative constraints. We validate our system through a multi-phase evaluation using Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. A lab study with a detailed ablation of system components is followed by a 5-day in-the-wild diary study. Our DPA pipeline helps our specialized model outperform GPT-4o on persona-specific metrics, and our CRE stage achieves near-perfect performance in coherence and robustness measures. Our study surfaces practical design guidelines for AI-driven narrative systems: we find that character-first self-training is foundational for believability, while explicit story-time constraints are crucial for sustaining coherent, interruption-resilient mobile-web experiences.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a workflow for transforming such documents into structured data using a combination of multimodal large language models (LLMs), an ontology-based reasoning model, and a custom extension of the Linked Art framework. We show how vision-language models can accurately parse and transcribe born-digital and digitised programmes, achieving over 98% of correct extraction. To overcome the challenges of semantic annotation, we train a reasoning model (POntAvignon) using reinforcement learning with both formal and semantic rewards. This approach enables automated RDF triple generation and supports alignment with existing knowledge graphs. Through a case study based on the Festival d'Avignon corpus, we demonstrate the potential for large-scale, ontology-driven analysis of performing arts data. Our results open new possibilities for interoperable, explainable, and sustainable computational theatre historiography.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, 17 references</p></details> |

While existing smart beehive systems monitor internal conditions, they typically overlook external environmental factors that significantly influence colony health, and are constrained by high cost, limited scalability, and inadequate contextual analysis. We present WaggleNet, a novel dual-scope monitoring system that simultaneously captures both internal hive conditions and external environmental parameters using a cost-effective LoRa-MQTT architecture. Our system deploys modular worker nodes ($\sim$\$15 each) equipped with temperature, humidity, light, and GPS sensors both inside and around beehives. A master node functions as a LoRa-MQTT gateway, forwarding data to a cloud server with a mobile application interface. Field experiments confirmed reliable operation with 100\% packet delivery over 110 meters in line-of-sight conditions and 95 meters in obstructed environments, including successful deployment inside wooden hive structures. Our system demonstrated stable end-to-end latency under 5 seconds and continuous operation over a two-month period across diverse environmental conditions. By bridging the gap between internal and external monitoring, WaggleNet enables contextual anomaly detection and supports data-driven precision beekeeping in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

| **[Tessellation GS: Neural Mesh Gaussians for Robust Monocular Reconstruction of Dynamic Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07381v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables highly photorealistic scene reconstruction from posed image sequences but struggles with viewpoint extrapolation due to its anisotropic nature, leading to overfitting and poor generalization, particularly in sparse-view and dynamic scene reconstruction. We propose Tessellation GS, a structured 2D GS approach anchored on mesh faces, to reconstruct dynamic scenes from a single continuously moving or static camera. Our method constrains 2D Gaussians to localized regions and infers their attributes via hierarchical neural features on mesh faces. Gaussian subdivision is guided by an adaptive face subdivision strategy driven by a detail-aware loss function. Additionally, we leverage priors from a reconstruction foundation model to initialize Gaussian deformations, enabling robust reconstruction of general dynamic objects from a single static camera, previously extremely challenging for optimization-based methods. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method, reducing LPIPS by 29.1% and Chamfer distance by 49.2% on appearance and mesh reconstruction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Debiasing Diffusion Priors via 3D Attention for Consistent Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07345v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Versatile 3D tasks (e.g., generation or editing) that distill from Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have attracted significant research interest for not relying on extensive 3D training data. However, T2I models exhibit limitations resulting from prior view bias, which produces conflicting appearances between different views of an object. This bias causes subject-words to preferentially activate prior view features during cross-attention (CA) computation, regardless of the target view condition. To overcome this limitation, we conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis to reveal the root cause of the prior view bias in T2I models. Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians. Notably, HAM facilitates semantic-specific interventions, enabling controllable and precise 3D editing. Extensive experiments firmly establish that TD-Attn has the potential to serve as a universal plugin, significantly enhancing multi-view consistency across 3D tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, 2 algorithms, Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Expectation-Maximization as the Engine of Scalable Medical Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03410v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large, high-quality, annotated datasets are the foundation of medical AI research, but constructing even a small, moderate-quality, annotated dataset can take years of effort from multidisciplinary teams. Although active learning can prioritize what to annotate, scaling up still requires extensive manual efforts to revise the noisy annotations. We formulate this as a missing-data problem and develop ScaleMAI, a framework that unifies data annotation and model development co-evolution through an Expectation-Maximization (EM) process. In this iterative process, the AI model automatically identifies and corrects the mistakes in annotations (Expectation), while the refined annotated data retrain the model to improve accuracy (Maximization). In addition to the classical EM algorithm, ScaleMAI brings human experts into the loop to review annotations that cannot be adequately addressed by either Expectation or Maximization step (<5%). As a result, ScaleMAI progressively creates an annotated dataset of 47,315 CT scans (4.8x larger than the largest public dataset, PanTS) including 4,163,720 per-voxel annotations for benign/malignant tumors and 88 anatomical structures. ScaleMAI iteratively trains a model that exceeds human expert performance in tumor diagnosis (+7%), and outperforms models developed from smaller, moderate-quality datasets, with statistically significant gains in tumor detection (+10%) and segmentation (+14%) on two prestigious benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient ASR for Low-Resource Languages: Leveraging Cross-Lingual Unlabeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07277v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic speech recognition for low-resource languages remains fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and computational resources required by state-of-the-art models. We present a systematic investigation into cross-lingual continuous pretraining for low-resource languages, using Perso-Arabic languages (Persian, Arabic, and Urdu) as our primary case study. Our approach demonstrates that strategic utilization of unlabeled speech data can effectively bridge the resource gap without sacrificing recognition accuracy. We construct a 3,000-hour multilingual corpus through a scalable unlabeled data collection pipeline and employ targeted continual pretraining combined with morphologically-aware tokenization to develop a 300M parameter model that achieves performance comparable to systems 5 times larger. Our model outperforms Whisper Large v3 (1.5B parameters) on Persian and achieves competitive results on Arabic and Urdu despite using significantly fewer parameters and substantially less labeled data. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that ASR quality scales primarily with model size, revealing instead that data relevance and strategic pretraining are more critical factors for low-resource scenarios. This work provides a practical pathway toward inclusive speech technology, enabling effective ASR for underrepresented languages without dependence on massive computational infrastructure or proprietary datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AACL IJCNLP 2025</p></details> |

Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead. This results in markedly improved visual quality, enabling high-fidelity, user-selectable frozen-time renderings, validated by a 96% user preference.

However, it also exposes these assets to serious risks of unauthorized editing and malicious tampering. Although imperceptible adversarial perturbations against diffusion models have proven effective for protecting 2D images, applying them to 3DGS encounters two major challenges: view-generalizable protection and balancing invisibility with protection capability. In this work, we propose the first editing safeguard for 3DGS, termed AdLift, which prevents instruction-driven editing across arbitrary views and dimensions by lifting strictly bounded 2D adversarial perturbations into 3D Gaussian-represented safeguard. To ensure both adversarial perturbations effectiveness and invisibility, these safeguard Gaussians are progressively optimized across training views using a tailored Lifted PGD, which first conducts gradient truncation during back-propagation from the editing model at the rendered image and applies projected gradients to strictly constrain the image-level perturbation. Then, the resulting perturbation is backpropagated to the safeguard Gaussian parameters via an image-to-Gaussian fitting operation. We alternate between gradient truncation and image-to-Gaussian fitting, yielding consistent adversarial-based protection performance across different viewpoints and generalizes to novel views. Empirically, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdLift effectively protects against state-of-the-art instruction-driven 2D image and 3DGS editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 34 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |
| **[Cross-platform Product Matching Based on Entity Alignment of Knowledge Graph with RAEA model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07232v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Product matching aims to identify identical or similar products sold on different platforms. By building knowledge graphs (KGs), the product matching problem can be converted to the Entity Alignment (EA) task, which aims to discover the equivalent entities from diverse KGs. The existing EA methods inadequately utilize both attribute triples and relation triples simultaneously, especially the interactions between them. This paper introduces a two-stage pipeline consisting of rough filter and fine filter to match products from eBay and Amazon. For fine filtering, a new framework for Entity Alignment, Relation-aware and Attribute-aware Graph Attention Networks for Entity Alignment (RAEA), is employed. RAEA focuses on the interactions between attribute triples and relation triples, where the entity representation aggregates the alignment signals from attributes and relations with Attribute-aware Entity Encoder and Relation-aware Graph Attention Networks. The experimental results indicate that the RAEA model achieves significant improvements over 12 baselines on EA task in the cross-lingual dataset DBP15K (6.59% on average Hits@1) and delivers competitive results in the monolingual dataset DWY100K. The source code for experiments on DBP15K and DWY100K is available at github (https://github.com/Mockingjay-liu/RAEA-model-for-Entity-Alignment).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, published on World Wide Web</p></details> |

Small errors in textual element reconstruction can lead to significant semantic loss. We propose STRinGS, a text-aware, selective refinement framework to address this issue for 3DGS reconstruction. Our method treats text and non-text regions separately, refining text regions first and merging them with non-text regions later for full-scene optimization. STRinGS produces sharp, readable text even in challenging configurations. We introduce a text readability measure OCR Character Error Rate (CER) to evaluate the efficacy on text regions. STRinGS results in a 63.6% relative improvement over 3DGS at just 7K iterations. We also introduce a curated dataset STRinGS-360 with diverse text scenarios to evaluate text readability in 3D reconstruction. Our method and dataset together push the boundaries of 3D scene understanding in text-rich environments, paving the way for more robust text-aware reconstruction methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026.

However, a single estimate cannot capture pose uncertainty deriving from visual ambiguity, which can lead to unreliable behavior. Existing pose distribution methods rely heavily on color information, often unavailable in industrial settings. We propose a novel neural network-based method for estimating object pose uncertainty using only 3D colorless data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that leverages deep learning for pose distribution estimation without relying on RGB input. We validate our method in a real-world bin picking scenario with objects of varying geometric ambiguity. Our current implementation focuses on symmetries in reflection and revolution, but the framework is extendable to full SE(3) pose distribution estimation.

However, its practical use is hindered by the massive memory and computational demands required to store and render millions of Gaussians. These challenges become even more severe in 4D dynamic scenes. To address these issues, the field of Efficient Gaussian Splatting has rapidly evolved, proposing methods that reduce redundancy while preserving reconstruction quality. This survey provides the first unified overview of efficient 3D and 4D Gaussian Splatting techniques. For both 3D and 4D settings, we systematically categorize existing methods into two major directions, Parameter Compression and Restructuring Compression, and comprehensively summarize the core ideas and methodological trends within each category. We further cover widely used datasets, evaluation metrics, and representative benchmark comparisons. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising research directions toward scalable, compact, and real-time Gaussian Splatting for both static and dynamic 3D scene representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

| **[Synchrony-Gated Plasticity with Dopamine Modulation for Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07194v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While surrogate backpropagation proves useful for training deep spiking neural networks (SNNs), incorporating biologically inspired local signals on a large scale remains challenging. This difficulty stems primarily from the high memory demands of maintaining accurate spike-timing logs and the potential for purely local plasticity adjustments to clash with the supervised learning goal. To effectively leverage local signals derived from spiking neuron dynamics, we introduce Dopamine-Modulated Spike-Synchrony-Dependent Plasticity (DA-SSDP), a synchrony-based rule that is sensitive to loss and brings a synchrony-based local learning signal to the model. DA-SSDP condenses spike patterns into a synchrony metric at the batch level. An initial brief warm-up phase assesses its relationship to the task loss and sets a fixed gate that subsequently adjusts the local update's magnitude. In cases where synchrony proves unrelated to the task, the gate settles at one, simplifying DA-SSDP to a basic two-factor synchrony mechanism that delivers minor weight adjustments driven by concurrent spike firing and a Gaussian latency function. These small weight updates are only added to the network`s deeper layers following the backpropagation phase, and our tests showed this simplified version did not degrade performance and sometimes gave a small accuracy boost, serving as a regularizer during training. The rule stores only binary spike indicators and first-spike latencies with a Gaussian kernel. Without altering the model structure or optimization routine, evaluations on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (+0.42\%), CIFAR-100 (+0.99\%), CIFAR10-DVS (+0.1\%), and ImageNet-1K (+0.73\%) demonstrated consistent accuracy gains, accompanied by a minor increase in computational overhead.

This paper focuses on the core technology of Knowledge Tracing (KT) models that analyze students' sequences of interactions to predict their knowledge acquisition levels. However, existing KT models suffer from limitations such as restricted input data formats, cold start problems arising with new student enrollment or new question addition, and insufficient stability in real-world service environments. To overcome these limitations, a Practical Interlinked Concept Knowledge Tracing (PICKT) model that can effectively process multiple types of input data is proposed. Specifically, a knowledge map structures the relationships among concepts considering the question and concept text information, thereby enabling effective knowledge tracing even in cold start situations. Experiments reflecting real operational environments demonstrated the model's excellent performance and practicality. The main contributions of this research are as follows. First, a model architecture that effectively utilizes diverse data formats is presented. Second, significant performance improvements are achieved over existing models for two core cold start challenges: new student enrollment and new question addition. Third, the model's stability and practicality are validated through delicate experimental design, enhancing its applicability in real-world product environments. This provides a crucial theoretical and technical foundation for the practical implementation of next-generation ITS.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 17 tables.

Existing methods typically apply uniform restoration strategies across the entire image, struggling to handle multiple co-occurring degradations that vary spatially and with water conditions. We introduce TIDE, a $\underline{t}$wo stage $\underline{i}$nverse $\underline{d}$egradation $\underline{e}$stimation framework that explicitly models degradation characteristics and applies targeted restoration through specialized prior decomposition. Our approach disentangles the restoration process into multiple specialized hypotheses that are adaptively fused based on local degradation patterns, followed by a progressive refinement stage that corrects residual artifacts. Specifically, TIDE decomposes underwater degradations into four key factors, namely color distortion, haze, detail loss, and noise, and designs restoration experts specialized for each. By generating specialized restoration hypotheses, TIDE balances competing degradation factors and produces natural results even in highly degraded regions. Extensive experiments across both standard benchmarks and challenging turbid water conditions show that TIDE achieves competitive performance on reference based fidelity metrics while outperforming state of the art methods on non reference perceptual quality metrics, with strong improvements in color correction and contrast enhancement.

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MuSASplat: Efficient Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Splats via Lightweight Multi-Scale Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07165v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse-view 3D Gaussian splatting seeks to render high-quality novel views of 3D scenes from a limited set of input images. While recent pose-free feed-forward methods leveraging pre-trained 3D priors have achieved impressive results, most of them rely on full fine-tuning of large Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones and incur substantial GPU costs. In this work, we introduce MuSASplat, a novel framework that dramatically reduces the computational burden of training pose-free feed-forward 3D Gaussian splats models with little compromise of rendering quality. Central to our approach is a lightweight Multi-Scale Adapter that enables efficient fine-tuning of ViT-based architectures with only a small fraction of training parameters. This design avoids the prohibitive GPU overhead associated with previous full-model adaptation techniques while maintaining high fidelity in novel view synthesis, even with very sparse input views. In addition, we introduce a Feature Fusion Aggregator that integrates features across input views effectively and efficiently. Unlike widely adopted memory banks, the Feature Fusion Aggregator ensures consistent geometric integration across input views and meanwhile mitigates the memory usage, training complexity, and computational costs significantly. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show that MuSASplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality but has significantly reduced parameters and training resource requirements as compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSVM: Learning Stochastic Volatility Models with Physics-Informed Deep Operator Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07162v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time calibration of stochastic volatility models (SVMs) is computationally bottlenecked by the need to repeatedly solve coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we propose DeepSVM, a physics-informed Deep Operator Network (PI-DeepONet) designed to learn the solution operator of the Heston model across its entire parameter space. Unlike standard data-driven deep learning (DL) approaches, DeepSVM requires no labelled training data. Rather, we employ a hard-constrained ansatz that enforces terminal payoffs and static no-arbitrage conditions by design. Furthermore, we use Residual-based Adaptive Refinement (RAR) to stabilize training in difficult regions subject to high gradients. Overall, DeepSVM achieves a final training loss of $10^{-5}$ and predicts highly accurate option prices across a range of typical market dynamics. While pricing accuracy is high, we find that the model's derivatives (Greeks) exhibit noise in the at-the-money (ATM) regime, highlighting the specific need for higher-order regularization in physics-informed operator learning.</p></details> |  |

ACE contains a hidden heldout set of 400 test cases, split across four consumer activities: shopping, food, gaming, and DIY. We are also open sourcing 80 cases as a devset with a CC-BY license. For the ACE leaderboard we evaluated 10 frontier models (with websearch turned on) using a novel grading methodology that dynamically checks whether relevant parts of the response are grounded in the retrieved web sources. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) is the top-performing model, scoring 56.1%, followed by o3 Pro (Thinking = On) at 55.2% and GPT 5.1 (Thinking = High) at 55.1%. Model scores differ across domains, and in Shopping the top model scores under 50\%. We find that models are prone to hallucinating key information, such as prices. ACE shows a substantial gap between the performance of even the best models and consumers' AI needs.</p></details> |  |

However, optimizing sensing strategies to balance spatial and temporal coverage, minimize redundancy, and address budget constraints remains a key challenge.This study proposes an adaptive framework for enhancing the sensing utility of sensor-equipped vehicles.By integrating heterogeneous open-source data, the framework leverages spatiotemporal weighting to optimize vehicle selection and sensing coverage across various urban contexts.An entropy-based vehicle selection strategy, \texttt{Improved OptiFleet}, is developed to maximize sensing utility while minimizing redundancy.The framework is validated using real-world air quality data from 320 sensor-equipped vehicles operating in Guangzhou, China, over two months.Key findings show that the proposed method outperforms baseline strategies, providing up to 5\% higher sensing utility with reduced fleet sizes, and also highlights the critical role of dynamic urban data in optimizing mobile sensing strategies.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, there has been growing interest in leveraging high-quality pre-trained visual representations, either by aligning them inside VAEs or directly within the generative model. However, adapting such representations remains challenging due to fundamental mismatches between understanding-oriented features and generation-friendly latent spaces. Representation encoders benefit from high-dimensional latents that capture diverse hypotheses for masked regions, whereas generative models favor low-dimensional latents that must faithfully preserve injected noise. This discrepancy has led prior work to rely on complex objectives and architectures. In this work, we propose FAE (Feature Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective framework that adapts pre-trained visual representations into low-dimensional latents suitable for generation using as little as a single attention layer, while retaining sufficient information for both reconstruction and understanding. The key is to couple two separate deep decoders: one trained to reconstruct the original feature space, and a second that takes the reconstructed features as input for image generation. FAE is generic; it can be instantiated with a variety of self-supervised encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP) and plugged into two distinct generative families: diffusion models and normalizing flows. Across class-conditional and text-to-image benchmarks, FAE achieves strong performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256, our diffusion model with CFG attains a near state-of-the-art FID of 1.29 (800 epochs) and 1.70 (80 epochs). Without CFG, FAE reaches the state-of-the-art FID of 1.48 (800 epochs) and 2.08 (80 epochs), demonstrating both high quality and fast learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Adoption and Usage of AI Agents: Early Evidence from Perplexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07828v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the first large-scale field study of the adoption, usage intensity, and use cases of general-purpose AI agents operating in open-world web environments. Our analysis centers on Comet, an AI-powered browser developed by Perplexity, and its integrated agent, Comet Assistant. Drawing on hundreds of millions of anonymized user interactions, we address three fundamental questions: Who is using AI agents? How intensively are they using them? And what are they using them for? Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in adoption and usage across user segments. Earlier adopters, users in countries with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment, and individuals working in digital or knowledge-intensive sectors -- such as digital technology, academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship -- are more likely to adopt or actively use the agent. To systematically characterize the substance of agent usage, we introduce a hierarchical agentic taxonomy that organizes use cases across three levels: topic, subtopic, and task. The two largest topics, Productivity & Workflow and Learning & Research, account for 57% of all agentic queries, while the two largest subtopics, Courses and Shopping for Goods, make up 22%. The top 10 out of 90 tasks represent 55% of queries. Personal use constitutes 55% of queries, while professional and educational contexts comprise 30% and 16%, respectively. In the short term, use cases exhibit strong stickiness, but over time users tend to shift toward more cognitively oriented topics. The diffusion of increasingly capable AI agents carries important implications for researchers, businesses, policymakers, and educators, inviting new lines of inquiry into this rapidly emerging class of AI capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Here we show that next-token prediction is provably powerful for learning longer-range structure, even with common neural network architectures. Specifically, we prove that optimizing next-token prediction over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) yields a model that closely approximates the training distribution: for held-out documents sampled from the training distribution, no algorithm of bounded description length limited to examining the next $k$ tokens, for any $k$, can distinguish between $k$ consecutive tokens of such documents and $k$ tokens generated by the learned language model following the same prefix. We provide polynomial bounds (in $k$, independent of the document length) on the model size needed to achieve such $k$-token indistinguishability, offering a complexity-theoretic explanation for the long-range coherence observed in practice.</p></details> | 66 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Distribution Matching Variational AutoEncoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07778v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most visual generative models compress images into a latent space before applying diffusion or autoregressive modelling. Yet, existing approaches such as VAEs and foundation model aligned encoders implicitly constrain the latent space without explicitly shaping its distribution, making it unclear which types of distributions are optimal for modeling. We introduce \textbf{Distribution-Matching VAE} (\textbf{DMVAE}), which explicitly aligns the encoder's latent distribution with an arbitrary reference distribution via a distribution matching constraint. This generalizes beyond the Gaussian prior of conventional VAEs, enabling alignment with distributions derived from self-supervised features, diffusion noise, or other prior distributions. With DMVAE, we can systematically investigate which latent distributions are more conducive to modeling, and we find that SSL-derived distributions provide an excellent balance between reconstruction fidelity and modeling efficiency, reaching gFID equals 3.2 on ImageNet with only 64 training epochs. Our results suggest that choosing a suitable latent distribution structure (achieved via distribution-level alignment), rather than relying on fixed priors, is key to bridging the gap between easy-to-model latents and high-fidelity image synthesis.

In this review, we examine the current state of the art in pHHI through three core pillars: (i) humanoid modeling and control, (ii) human intent estimation, and (iii) computational human models. For each pillar, we survey representative approaches, identify open challenges, and analyze current limitations that hinder robust, scalable, and adaptive interaction. These include the need for whole-body control strategies capable of handling uncertain human dynamics, real-time intent inference under limited sensing, and modeling techniques that account for variability in human physical states. Although significant progress has been made within each domain, integration across pillars remains limited. We propose pathways for unifying methods across these areas to enable cohesive interaction frameworks. This structure enables us not only to map the current landscape but also to propose concrete directions for future research that aim to bridge these domains. Additionally, we introduce a unified taxonomy of interaction types based on modality, distinguishing between direct interactions (e.g., physical contact) and indirect interactions (e.g., object-mediated), and on the level of robot engagement, ranging from assistance to cooperation and collaboration. For each category in this taxonomy, we provide the three core pillars that highlight opportunities for cross-pillar unification. Our goal is to suggest avenues to advance robust, safe, and intuitive physical interaction, providing a roadmap for future research that will allow humanoid systems to effectively understand, anticipate, and collaborate with human partners in diverse real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Source Inversion and Parameters Estimation in Atmospheric Dispersion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07755v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown the success of deep learning in solving forward and inverse problems in engineering and scientific computing domains, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In the fields of atmospheric science and environmental monitoring, estimating emission source locations is a central task that further relies on multiple model parameters that dictate velocity profiles and diffusion parameters. Estimating these parameters at the same time as emission sources from scarce data is a difficult task. In this work, we achieve this by leveraging the flexibility and generality of PINNs. We use a weighted adaptive method based on the neural tangent kernels to solve a source inversion problem with parameter estimation on the 2D and 3D advection-diffusion equations with unknown velocity and diffusion coefficients that may vary in space and time. Our proposed weighted adaptive method is presented as an extension of PINNs for forward PDE problems to a highly ill-posed source inversion and parameter estimation problem. The key idea behind our methodology is to attempt the joint recovery of the solution, the sources along with the unknown parameters, thereby using the underlying partial differential equation as a constraint that couples multiple unknown functional parameters, leading to more efficient use of the limited information in the measurements. We present various numerical experiments, using different types of measurements that model practical engineering systems, to show that our proposed method is indeed successful and robust to additional noise in the measurements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models for Image Restoration and Enhancement: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09388v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) has been an indispensable and challenging task in the low-level vision field, which strives to improve the subjective quality of images distorted by various forms of degradation. Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[DiffusionDriveV2: Reinforcement Learning-Constrained Truncated Diffusion Modeling in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07745v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models for end-to-end autonomous driving often suffer from mode collapse, tending to generate conservative and homogeneous behaviors. While DiffusionDrive employs predefined anchors representing different driving intentions to partition the action space and generate diverse trajectories, its reliance on imitation learning lacks sufficient constraints, resulting in a dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality. In this work, we propose DiffusionDriveV2, which leverages reinforcement learning to both constrain low-quality modes and explore for superior trajectories. This significantly enhances the overall output quality while preserving the inherent multimodality of its core Gaussian Mixture Model. First, we use scale-adaptive multiplicative noise, ideal for trajectory planning, to promote broad exploration. Second, we employ intra-anchor GRPO to manage advantage estimation among samples generated from a single anchor, and inter-anchor truncated GRPO to incorporate a global perspective across different anchors, preventing improper advantage comparisons between distinct intentions (e.g., turning vs. going straight), which can lead to further mode collapse. DiffusionDriveV2 achieves 91.2 PDMS on the NAVSIM v1 dataset and 85.5 EPDMS on the NAVSIM v2 dataset in closed-loop evaluation with an aligned ResNet-34 backbone, setting a new record. Further experiments validate that our approach resolves the dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality for truncated diffusion models, achieving the best trade-off.

| **[ViSA: 3D-Aware Video Shading for Real-Time Upper-Body Avatar Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07720v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-fidelity upper-body 3D avatars from one-shot input image remains a significant challenge. Current 3D avatar generation methods, which rely on large reconstruction models, are fast and capable of producing stable body structures, but they often suffer from artifacts such as blurry textures and stiff, unnatural motion. In contrast, generative video models show promising performance by synthesizing photorealistic and dynamic results, but they frequently struggle with unstable behavior, including body structural errors and identity drift. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework employs a 3D reconstruction model to provide robust structural and appearance priors, which in turn guides a real-time autoregressive video diffusion model for rendering. This process enables the model to synthesize high-frequency, photorealistic details and fluid dynamics in real time, effectively reducing texture blur and motion stiffness while preventing the structural inconsistencies common in video generation methods. By uniting the geometric stability of 3D reconstruction with the generative capabilities of video models, our method produces high-fidelity digital avatars with realistic appearance and dynamic, temporally coherent motion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces artifacts and achieves substantial improvements in visual quality over leading methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for real-time applications such as gaming and virtual reality.

| **[Guiding What Not to Generate: Automated Negative Prompting for Text-Image Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07702v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite substantial progress in text-to-image generation, achieving precise text-image alignment remains challenging, particularly for prompts with rich compositional structure or imaginative elements. To address this, we introduce Negative Prompting for Image Correction (NPC), an automated pipeline that improves alignment by identifying and applying negative prompts that suppress unintended content. We begin by analyzing cross-attention patterns to explain why both targeted negatives-those directly tied to the prompt's alignment error-and untargeted negatives-tokens unrelated to the prompt but present in the generated image-can enhance alignment. To discover useful negatives, NPC generates candidate prompts using a verifier-captioner-proposer framework and ranks them with a salient text-space score, enabling effective selection without requiring additional image synthesis. On GenEval++ and Imagine-Bench, NPC outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.571 vs. 0.371 on GenEval++ and the best overall performance on Imagine-Bench. By guiding what not to generate, NPC provides a principled, fully automated route to stronger text-image alignment in diffusion models.

This inference delay creates a gap of tens to hundreds of milliseconds between the observed state and the state at execution. In this work, we take the natural generalization from zero delay to measured delay during training and inference. We introduce Delay-Aware Diffusion Policy (DA-DP), a framework for explicitly incorporating inference delays into policy learning. DA-DP corrects zero-delay trajectories to their delay-compensated counterparts, and augments the policy with delay conditioning. We empirically validate DA-DP on a variety of tasks, robots, and delays and find its success rate more robust to delay than delay-unaware methods. DA-DP is architecture agnostic and transfers beyond diffusion policies, offering a general pattern for delay-aware imitation learning. More broadly, DA-DP encourages evaluation protocols that report performance as a function of measured latency, not just task difficulty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Z-Image: An Efficient Image Generation Foundation Model with Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22699v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of high-performance image generation models is currently dominated by proprietary systems, such as Nano Banana Pro and Seedream 4.0. Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction-based Time Series Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01504v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute- and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to unseen conditions through few-shot learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimization-Guided Diffusion for Interactive Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07661v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic and diverse multi-agent driving scenes are crucial for evaluating autonomous vehicles, but safety-critical events which are essential for this task are rare and underrepresented in driving datasets. Data-driven scene generation offers a low-cost alternative by synthesizing complex traffic behaviors from existing driving logs. However, existing models often lack controllability or yield samples that violate physical or social constraints, limiting their usability. We present OMEGA, an optimization-guided, training-free framework that enforces structural consistency and interaction awareness during diffusion-based sampling from a scene generation model. OMEGA re-anchors each reverse diffusion step via constrained optimization, steering the generation towards physically plausible and behaviorally coherent trajectories. Building on this framework, we formulate ego-attacker interactions as a game-theoretic optimization in the distribution space, approximating Nash equilibria to generate realistic, safety-critical adversarial scenarios. Experiments on nuPlan and Waymo show that OMEGA improves generation realism, consistency, and controllability, increasing the ratio of physically and behaviorally valid scenes from 32.35% to 72.27% for free exploration capabilities, and from 11% to 80% for controllability-focused generation. Our approach can also generate $5\times$ more near-collision frames with a time-to-collision under three seconds while maintaining the overall scene realism.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of the latter is often capped by the former. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose DMDR, a novel framework that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques into the distillation process. We show that for the RL of the few-step generator, the DMD loss itself is a more effective regularization compared to the traditional ones. In turn, RL can help to guide the mode coverage process in DMD more effectively. These allow us to unlock the capacity of the few-step generator by conducting distillation and RL simultaneously. Meanwhile, we design the dynamic distribution guidance and dynamic renoise sampling training strategies to improve the initial distillation process. The experiments demonstrate that DMDR can achieve leading visual quality, prompt coherence among few-step methods, and even exhibit performance that exceeds the multi-step teacher.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The synergy of reinforcement learning and distribution matching distillation.

While recent advances leverage Large Language Model (LLM) for sequential modeling, existing LLM-based approaches face two key limitations: (i) strong reliance on the contextual completeness of user histories, resulting in poor performance on out-of-history (OOH) scenarios; (ii) limited scalability, due to the restricted context window of LLMs, which limits their ability to access and process a large number of candidate POIs. To address these challenges, we propose Tool4POI, a novel tool-augmented framework that enables LLMs to perform open-set POI recommendation through external retrieval and reasoning. Tool4POI consists of three key modules: preference extraction module, multi-turn candidate retrieval module, and reranking module, which together summarize long-term user interests, interact with external tools to retrieve relevant POIs, and refine final recommendations based on recent behaviors. Unlike existing methods, Tool4POI requires no task-specific fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that Tool4POI substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 40% accuracy on challenging OOH scenarios where existing methods fail, and delivering average improvements of 20% and 30% on Acc@5 and Acc@10, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cri...</summary><p>A critical technical error was discovered during our internal review, leading to unreliable experimental results.

In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Article (14 Pages, 3 Figures), Appendix (5 Pages) Accepted for presentation at SIAM PP26</p></details> |

We introduce the first generative model that conditions on voxel-level, continuous tumor concentrations to synthesize high-fidelity brain tumor MRIs. For the BraTS 2025 Inpainting Challenge, we adapt this architecture to the complementary task of healthy tissue restoration by setting the tumor concentrations to zero. Our latent diffusion model conditioned on both tissue segmentations and the tumor concentrations generates 3D spatially coherent and anatomically consistent images for both tumor synthesis and healthy tissue inpainting. For healthy inpainting, we achieve a PSNR of 18.5, and for tumor inpainting, we achieve 17.4. Our code is available at: https://github.com/valentin-biller/ldm.git</p></details> |  |

We develop a dedicated rule-based procedure for computing these generalizations, prove its termination, soundness, and completeness, extend it modulo equational theories, and integrate it into a standard anti-unification framework.

These compact motion priors enable a new approach to ultra-low bitrate communication while achieving high-quality reconstruction across diverse scene contents. At the encoder side, motion priors can be streamlined into compact representations via a dense-to-sparse transformation. At the decoder side, these priors facilitate the reconstruction of scene dynamics using an advanced flow-driven diffusion model. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion-performance and outperform the state-of-the-art conventional-video codec Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) on-scene dynamics sequences.

This strategy establishes the model as a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), delivering superior text-rendering capabilities and remarkable photorealism, and significantly enhancing aesthetic quality. 2) Notably, it sets a new industry standard for Chinese character rendering. By supporting even complex and rare characters, it outperforms both major open-source and commercial solutions in coverage, while also achieving superior accuracy. 3) The model achieves remarkable efficiency through its compact design. With a core diffusion model of only 6B parameters, it is significantly smaller than the nearly 20B or larger Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures common in the field. This ensures minimal VRAM usage and rapid inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Beyond generation, LongCat-Image also excels in image editing, achieving SOTA results on standard benchmarks with superior editing consistency compared to other open-source works. 4) To fully empower the community, we have established the most comprehensive open-source ecosystem to date. We are releasing not only multiple model versions for text-to-image and image editing, including checkpoints after mid-training and post-training stages, but also the entire toolchain of training procedure. We believe that the openness of LongCat-Image will provide robust support for developers and researchers, pushing the frontiers of visual content creation.</p></details> |  |

We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100% navigation success and 0.09s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for publication and is currently under review</p></details> |

It covers an introduction to machine learning and describes various theoretical advances and practical projects in the field. The Lecture here is presented in its original format, but a few remarks have been added in 2025 to reflect recent developments, and the list of references has been updated to enhance the convenience and accuracy for readers. When did machine learning start? Maybe a good starting point is 1949, when Claude Shannon proposed a learning algorithm for chess-playing programs. Or maybe we should go back to the 1930s when Ronald Fisher developed discriminant analysis - a type of learning where the problem is to construct a decision rule that separates two types of vectors. Or could it be the 18th century when David Hume discussed the idea of induction? Or the 14th century, when William of Ockham formulated the principle of "simplicity" known as "Ockham's razor" (Ockham, by the way, is a small village not far from Royal Holloway). Or it may be that, like almost everything else in Western civilisation and culture, the origin of these ideas lies in the Mediterranean. After all, it was Aristotle who said that "we learn some things only by doing things". The field of machine learning has been greatly influenced by other disciplines and the subject is in itself not a very homogeneous discipline, but includes separate, overlapping subfields. There are many parallel lines of research in ML: inductive learning, neural networks, clustering, and theories of learning. They are all part of the more general field of machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inaug...</summary><p>Inaugural Lecture. 18 pages, 13 figures, Published in 1997 by Royal Holloway, University of London, ISBN 0 900145 93 5</p></details> |

By flattening graphs into random sequences of tokens through a reversible process, AutoGraph enables modeling graphs as sequences without relying on additional node features that are expensive to compute, in contrast to diffusion-based approaches. This results in sampling complexity and sequence lengths that scale optimally linearly with the number of edges, making it scalable and efficient for large, sparse graphs. A key success factor of AutoGraph is that its sequence prefixes represent induced subgraphs, creating a direct link to sub-sentences in language modeling. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and molecular benchmarks, with up to 100x faster generation and 3x faster training than leading diffusion models. It also supports substructure-conditioned generation without fine-tuning and shows promising transferability, bridging language modeling and graph generation to lay the groundwork for graph foundation models.

It has recently been shown that predefined vector systems, specifically An root system vectors, can be used as targets for latent space configurations (LSC) to ensure the desired LS structure. One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training. It is also shown that using the minimum number of LS dimensions for a specific number of classes results in faster convergence. The latter has potential advantages for reducing the size of vector databases used to store NN embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 4 equations</p></details> |
| **[Training-Free Diffusion Priors for Text-to-Image Generation via Optimization-based Visual Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20821v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, technical report (preprint)</p></details> |

One prominent issue is vanishing point inconsistency, where projections of parallel lines fail to converge correctly in 2D space. This leads to structurally implausible geometry that degrades spatial realism, especially in architectural scenes. We propose ControlVP, a user-guided framework for correcting vanishing point inconsistencies in generated images. Our approach extends a pre-trained diffusion model by incorporating structural guidance derived from building contours. We also introduce geometric constraints that explicitly encourage alignment between image edges and perspective cues. Our method enhances global geometric consistency while maintaining visual fidelity comparable to the baselines. This capability is particularly valuable for applications that require accurate spatial structure, such as image-to-3D reconstruction.

| **[Event-Customized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02483v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customized Image Generation, generating customized images with user-specified concepts, has raised significant attention due to its creativity and novelty. With impressive progress achieved in subject customization, some pioneer works further explored the customization of action and interaction beyond entity (i.e., human, animal, and object) appearance. However, these approaches only focus on basic actions and interactions between two entities, and their effects are limited by insufficient ''exactly same'' reference images. To extend customized image generation to more complex scenes for general real-world applications, we propose a new task: event-customized image generation. Given a single reference image, we define the ''event'' as all specific actions, poses, relations, or interactions between different entities in the scene. This task aims at accurately capturing the complex event and generating customized images with various target entities. To solve this task, we proposed a novel training-free event customization method: FreeEvent. Specifically, FreeEvent introduces two extra paths alongside the general diffusion denoising process: 1) Entity switching path: it applies cross-attention guidance and regulation for target entity generation. 2) Event transferring path: it injects the spatial feature and self-attention maps from the reference image to the target image for event generation. To further facilitate this new task, we collected two evaluation benchmarks: SWiG-Event and Real-Event. Extensive experiments and ablations have demonstrated the effectiveness of FreeEvent.</p></details> |  |

In this work, inspired by the denoising capability of diffusion models, we invert the conventional perspective and propose a clean-to-noisy paradigm that learns to synthesize noisy depth, thereby bridging the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven robotic learning. Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection. (2) Achieving zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation, substantially improving real-world performance without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ar...</summary><p>We are the author team of the paper "RealD$^2$iff: Bridging Real-World Gap in Robot Manipulation via Depth Diffusion".

Yet, emerging and disruptive technologies are reshaping the landscape of nuclear risks, presenting a critical juncture for decision makers. This article lays out the contours of an overlooked but intensifying technological arms race for nuclear (in)visibility, driven by the interplay between proliferation-enabling technologies (PETs) and detection-enhancing technologies (DETs). We argue that the strategic pattern of proliferation will be increasingly shaped by the innovation pace in these domains. Artificial intelligence (AI) introduces unprecedented complexity to this equation, as its rapid scaling and knowledge substitution capabilities accelerate PET development and challenge traditional monitoring and verification methods. To analyze this dynamic, we develop a formal model centered on a Relative Advantage Index (RAI), quantifying the shifting balance between PETs and DETs. Our model explores how asymmetric technological advancement, particularly logistic AI-driven PET growth versus stepwise DET improvements, expands the band of uncertainty surrounding proliferation detectability. Through replicable scenario-based simulations, we evaluate the impact of varying PET growth rates and DET investment strategies on cumulative nuclear breakout risk. We identify a strategic fork ahead, where detection may no longer suffice without broader PET governance. Governments and international organizations should accordingly invest in policies and tools agile enough to keep pace with tomorrow's technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best Paper Award (2025) from Risk Analysis as one of the articles published in the journal that year with the most significant impacts to the theory or practice of risk analysis.

Unlike diffusion approaches, which refine atomic positions iteratively through many denoising steps, Materium places atoms at precise fractional coordinates, enabling fast, scalable generation. With this design, the model can be trained in a few hours on a single GPU and generate samples much faster on GPUs and CPUs than diffusion-based approaches. The model was trained and evaluated using multiple properties as conditions, including fundamental properties, such as density and space group, as well as more practical targets, such as band gap and magnetic density. In both single and combined conditions, the model performs consistently well, producing candidates that align with the requested inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-step Diffusion-based Video Coding with Semantic-Temporal Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07480v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While traditional and neural video codecs (NVCs) have achieved remarkable rate-distortion performance, improving perceptual quality at low bitrates remains challenging. Some NVCs incorporate perceptual or adversarial objectives but still suffer from artifacts due to limited generation capacity, whereas others leverage pretrained diffusion models to improve quality at the cost of heavy sampling complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose S2VC, a Single-Step diffusion based Video Codec that integrates a conditional coding framework with an efficient single-step diffusion generator, enabling realistic reconstruction at low bitrates with reduced sampling cost. Recognizing the importance of semantic conditioning in single-step diffusion, we introduce Contextual Semantic Guidance to extract frame-adaptive semantics from buffered features. It replaces text captions with efficient, fine-grained conditioning, thereby improving generation realism. In addition, Temporal Consistency Guidance is incorporated into the diffusion U-Net to enforce temporal coherence across frames and ensure stable generation. Extensive experiments show that S2VC delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with an average 52.73% bitrate saving over prior perceptual methods, underscoring the promise of single-step diffusion for efficient, high-quality video compression.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Analysis of Decision Problems for Relational Pattern Languages under Various Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07476v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patterns are words with terminals and variables. The language of a pattern is the set of words obtained by uniformly substituting all variables with words that contain only terminals. In their original definition, patterns only allow for multiple distinct occurrences of some variables to be related by the equality relation, represented by using the same variable multiple times. In an extended notion, called relational patterns and relational pattern languages, variables may be related by arbitrary other relations. We extend the ongoing investigation of the main decision problems for patterns (namely, the membership problem, the inclusion problem, and the equivalence problem) to relational pattern languages under a wide range of individual relations. It is shown show that - even for many much simpler or less restrictive relations - the complexity and (un)decidability characteristics of these problems do not change compared to the classical case where variables are related only by equality.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages (incl. appendix and references), 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Living the Novel: A System for Generating Self-Training Timeline-Aware Conversational Agents from Novels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07474v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the Living Novel, an end-to-end system that transforms any literary work into an immersive, multi-character conversational experience. This system is designed to solve two fundamental challenges for LLM-driven characters. Firstly, generic LLMs suffer from persona drift, often failing to stay in character. Secondly, agents often exhibit abilities that extend beyond the constraints of the story's world and logic, leading to both narrative incoherence (spoiler leakage) and robustness failures (frame-breaking). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage training pipeline. Our Deep Persona Alignment (DPA) stage uses data-free reinforcement finetuning to instill deep character fidelity. Our Coherence and Robustness Enhancing (CRE) stage then employs a story-time-aware knowledge graph and a second retrieval-grounded training pass to architecturally enforce these narrative constraints. We validate our system through a multi-phase evaluation using Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. A lab study with a detailed ablation of system components is followed by a 5-day in-the-wild diary study. Our DPA pipeline helps our specialized model outperform GPT-4o on persona-specific metrics, and our CRE stage achieves near-perfect performance in coherence and robustness measures. Our study surfaces practical design guidelines for AI-driven narrative systems: we find that character-first self-training is foundational for believability, while explicit story-time constraints are crucial for sustaining coherent, interruption-resilient mobile-web experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Video Editing with Temporal Reasoner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07469v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video editing methods face a critical trade-off: expert models offer precision but rely on task-specific priors like masks, hindering unification; conversely, unified temporal in-context learning models are mask-free but lack explicit spatial cues, leading to weak instruction-to-region mapping and imprecise localization. To resolve this conflict, we propose VideoCoF, a novel Chain-of-Frames approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VideoCoF enforces a ``see, reason, then edit" procedure by compelling the video diffusion model to first predict reasoning tokens (edit-region latents) before generating the target video tokens. This explicit reasoning step removes the need for user-provided masks while achieving precise instruction-to-region alignment and fine-grained video editing. Furthermore, we introduce a RoPE alignment strategy that leverages these reasoning tokens to ensure motion alignment and enable length extrapolation beyond the training duration. We demonstrate that with a minimal data cost of only 50k video pairs, VideoCoF achieves state-of-the-art performance on VideoCoF-Bench, validating the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Our code, weight, data are available at https://github.com/knightyxp/VideoCoF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://videocof.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[From Show Programmes to Data: Designing a Workflow to Make Performing Arts Ephemera Accessible Through Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07452v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many heritage institutions hold extensive collections of theatre programmes, which remain largely underused due to their complex layouts and lack of structured metadata. In this paper, we present a workflow for transforming such documents into structured data using a combination of multimodal large language models (LLMs), an ontology-based reasoning model, and a custom extension of the Linked Art framework. We show how vision-language models can accurately parse and transcribe born-digital and digitised programmes, achieving over 98% of correct extraction. To overcome the challenges of semantic annotation, we train a reasoning model (POntAvignon) using reinforcement learning with both formal and semantic rewards. This approach enables automated RDF triple generation and supports alignment with existing knowledge graphs. Through a case study based on the Festival d'Avignon corpus, we demonstrate the potential for large-scale, ontology-driven analysis of performing arts data. Our results open new possibilities for interoperable, explainable, and sustainable computational theatre historiography.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, 17 references</p></details> |
| **[InterAgent: Physics-based Multi-agent Command Execution via Diffusion on Interaction Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07410v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid agents are expected to emulate the complex coordination inherent in human social behaviors. However, existing methods are largely confined to single-agent scenarios, overlooking the physically plausible interplay essential for multi-agent interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose InterAgent, the first end-to-end framework for text-driven physics-based multi-agent humanoid control. At its core, we introduce an autoregressive diffusion transformer equipped with multi-stream blocks, which decouples proprioception, exteroception, and action to mitigate cross-modal interference while enabling synergistic coordination. We further propose a novel interaction graph exteroception representation that explicitly captures fine-grained joint-to-joint spatial dependencies to facilitate network learning. Additionally, within it we devise a sparse edge-based attention mechanism that dynamically prunes redundant connections and emphasizes critical inter-agent spatial relations, thereby enhancing the robustness of interaction modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterAgent consistently outperforms multiple strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It enables producing coherent, physically plausible, and semantically faithful multi-agent behaviors from only text prompts. Our code and data will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://binlee26.github.io/InterAgent-Page</p></details> |
| **[WaggleNet: A LoRa and MQTT-Based Monitoring System for Internal and External Beehive Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07408v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bee populations are declining globally due to habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and climate change, threatening agricultural productivity and food security. While existing smart beehive systems monitor internal conditions, they typically overlook external environmental factors that significantly influence colony health, and are constrained by high cost, limited scalability, and inadequate contextual analysis. We present WaggleNet, a novel dual-scope monitoring system that simultaneously captures both internal hive conditions and external environmental parameters using a cost-effective LoRa-MQTT architecture. Our system deploys modular worker nodes ($\sim$\$15 each) equipped with temperature, humidity, light, and GPS sensors both inside and around beehives. A master node functions as a LoRa-MQTT gateway, forwarding data to a cloud server with a mobile application interface. Field experiments confirmed reliable operation with 100\% packet delivery over 110 meters in line-of-sight conditions and 95 meters in obstructed environments, including successful deployment inside wooden hive structures. Our system demonstrated stable end-to-end latency under 5 seconds and continuous operation over a two-month period across diverse environmental conditions. By bridging the gap between internal and external monitoring, WaggleNet enables contextual anomaly detection and supports data-driven precision beekeeping in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

| **[Modeling diffusion in networks with communities: a multitype branching process approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04456v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamics of diffusion in complex networks are widely studied to understand how entities, such as information, diseases, or behaviors, spread in an interconnected environment. Complex networks often present community structure, and tools to analyze diffusion processes on networks with communities are needed. In this paper, we develop theoretical tools using multi-type branching processes to model and analyze diffusion processes, following a simple contagion mechanism, across a broad class of networks with community structure. We show how, by using limited information about the network -- the degree distribution within and between communities -- we can calculate standard statistical characteristics of propagation dynamics, such as the extinction probability, hazard function, and cascade size distribution. These properties can be estimated not only for the entire network but also for each community separately. Furthermore, we estimate the probability of spread crossing from one community to another where it is not currently spreading. We demonstrate the accuracy of our framework by applying it to two specific examples: the Stochastic Block Model and a log-normal network with community structure. We show how the initial seeding location affects the observed cascade size distribution on a heavy-tailed network and that our framework accurately captures this effect.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAMAC: Multimodal Risk-Aware Offline Reinforcement Learning and the Role of Behavior Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02695v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value or model-based pessimism, and restricted policy classes that limit policy expressiveness, whereas diffusion/flow-based expressive generative policies trained with a behavioral-cloning (BC) objective have been used only in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)}, which couples an expressive generative actor with a distributional critic and, to our knowledge, is the first model-free approach that learns \emph{risk-aware expressive generative policies}. RAMAC differentiates a composite objective that adds a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) term to a BC loss, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex multimodal scenarios. Since out-of-distribution (OOD) actions are a major driver of catastrophic failures in offline RL, we further analyze OOD behavior under prior-anchored perturbation schemes from recent BC-regularized risk-averse offline RL. This clarifies why a behavior-regularized objective that directly constrains the expressive generative policy to the dataset support provides an effective, risk-agnostic mechanism for suppressing OOD actions in modern expressive policies. We instantiate RAMAC with a diffusion-based actor, using it both to illustrate the analysis in a 2-D risky bandit and to deploy OOD-action detectors on Stochastic-D4RL benchmarks, empirically validating our insights. Across these tasks, we observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining strong returns. Our implementation is available at GitHub: https://github.com/KaiFukazawa/RAMAC.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-Efficient Serving for Video Diffusion Models with Latent Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07350v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (VDMs) perform attention computation over the 3D spatio-temporal domain. Compared to large language models (LLMs) processing 1D sequences, their memory consumption scales cubically, necessitating parallel serving across multiple GPUs. Traditional parallelism strategies partition the computational graph, requiring frequent high-dimensional activation transfers that create severe communication bottlenecks. To tackle this issue, we exploit the local spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in the diffusion denoising process and propose Latent Parallelism (LP), the first parallelism strategy tailored for VDM serving. \textcolor{black}{LP decomposes the global denoising problem into parallelizable sub-problems by dynamically rotating the partitioning dimensions (temporal, height, and width) within the compact latent space across diffusion timesteps, substantially reducing the communication overhead compared to prevailing parallelism strategies.} To ensure generation quality, we design a patch-aligned overlapping partition strategy that matches partition boundaries with visual patches and a position-aware latent reconstruction mechanism for smooth stitching. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that LP reduces communication overhead by up to 97\% over baseline methods while maintaining comparable generation quality. As a non-intrusive plug-in paradigm, LP can be seamlessly integrated with existing parallelism strategies, enabling efficient and scalable video generation services.</p></details> | 19 pages |
