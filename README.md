| **[DKPMV: Dense Keypoints Fusion from Multi-View RGB Frames for 6D Pose Estimation of Textureless Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10933v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance. In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training, improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects. Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[SenseShift6D: Multimodal RGB-D Benchmarking for Robust 6D Pose Estimation across Environment and Sensor Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05751v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation have achieved high performance on representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or depth-sensor mode-and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate such variations-largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures, 9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels. For five common household objects (spray, pringles, tincase, sandwich, and mouse), we acquire 166.4k RGB and 16.7k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our dataset demonstrate that applying multimodal sensor control at test time yields substantial performance gains, achieving a 19.5 pp improvement on pretrained generalizable models. It also enhances robustness precisely where those models tend to fail. Moreover, even instance-level pose estimators, where train and test set share identical object and background, performance still varies under environmental and sensor change, demonstrating that test-time sensor control remains effective compared to costly expansions in the quantity and diversity of real-world training data, without any additional training. SenseShift6D extends the object pose evaluation paradigm from data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive, self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Object 6D Pose Estimation with a Single Reference View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05578v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing novel object 6D pose estimation methods typically rely on CAD models or dense reference views, which are both difficult to acquire. Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in a common coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative object-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting. Code will be released at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/SinRef-6D.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures (including supplementary material)</p></details> |
| **[Joint Learning of Pose Regression and Denoising Diffusion with Score Scaling Sampling for Category-level 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04125v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latest diffusion models have shown promising results in category-level 6D object pose estimation by modeling the conditional pose distribution with depth image input. The existing methods, however, suffer from slow convergence during training, learning its encoder with the diffusion denoising network in end-to-end fashion, and require an additional network that evaluates sampled pose hypotheses to filter out low-quality pose candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline that tackles these limitations by two key components. First, the proposed method pretrains the encoder with the direct pose regression head, and jointly learns the networks via the regression head and the denoising diffusion head, significantly accelerating training convergence while achieving higher accuracy. Second, sampling guidance via time-dependent score scaling is proposed s.t. the exploration-exploitation trade-off is effectively taken, eliminating the need for the additional evaluation network. The sampling guidance maintains multi-modal characteristics of symmetric objects at early denoising steps while ensuring high-quality pose generation at final steps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including REAL275, HouseCat6D, and ROPE, demonstrate that the proposed method, simple yet effective, achieves state-of-the-art accuracies even with single-pose inference, while being more efficient in both training and inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Color-Pair Guided Robust Zero-Shot 6D Pose Estimation and Tracking of Cluttered Objects on Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23647v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker. The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through abrupt pose changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMD: A 6-DoF Pose Estimation Benchmark for Industrial Metallic Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11680v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object 6DoF (6D) pose estimation is essential for robotic perception, especially in industrial settings. It enables robots to interact with the environment and manipulate objects. However, existing benchmarks on object 6D pose estimation primarily use everyday objects with rich textures and low-reflectivity, limiting model generalization to industrial scenarios where objects are often metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective. To address this gap, we propose a novel dataset and benchmark namely \textit{Industrial Metallic Dataset (IMD)}, tailored for industrial applications. Our dataset comprises 45 true-to-scale industrial components, captured with an RGB-D camera under natural indoor lighting and varied object arrangements to replicate real-world conditions. The benchmark supports three tasks, including video object segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation. We evaluate existing state-of-the-art models, including XMem and SAM2 for segmentation, and BundleTrack and BundleSDF for pose estimation, to assess model performance in industrial contexts. Evaluation results show that our industrial dataset is more challenging than existing household object datasets. This benchmark provides the baseline for developing and comparing segmentation and pose estimation algorithms that better generalize to industrial robotics scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 19 figures, 2 tables.

| **[ActivePose: Active 6D Object Pose Estimation and Tracking for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11364v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6-DoF object pose estimation and tracking are critical for reliable robotic manipulation. However, zero-shot methods often fail under viewpoint-induced ambiguities and fixed-camera setups struggle when objects move or become self-occluded. To address these challenges, we propose an active pose estimation pipeline that combines a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with "robotic imagination" to dynamically detect and resolve ambiguities in real time. In an offline stage, we render a dense set of views of the CAD model, compute the FoundationPose entropy for each view, and construct a geometric-aware prompt that includes low-entropy (unambiguous) and high-entropy (ambiguous) examples. At runtime, the system: (1) queries the VLM on the live image for an ambiguity score; (2) if ambiguity is detected, imagines a discrete set of candidate camera poses by rendering virtual views, scores each based on a weighted combination of VLM ambiguity probability and FoundationPose entropy, and then moves the camera to the Next-Best-View (NBV) to obtain a disambiguated pose estimation. Furthermore, since moving objects may leave the camera's field of view, we introduce an active pose tracking module: a diffusion-policy trained via imitation learning, which generates camera trajectories that preserve object visibility and minimize pose ambiguity. Experiments in simulation and real-world show that our approach significantly outperforms classical baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6D Po...</summary><p>6D Pose, Diffusion Policy</p></details> |
| **[Aleatoric Uncertainty from AI-based 6D Object Pose Predictors for Object-relative State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01583v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the object-relative state estimation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[UnPose: Uncertainty-Guided Diffusion Priors for Zero-Shot Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15972v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However, acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available, we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent 3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2025.

| **[Learning Point Cloud Representations with Pose Continuity for Depth-Based Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14358v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25 benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world applications.

| **[MR6D: Benchmarking 6D Pose Estimation for Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13775v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators, interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/anas-gouda/mr6d.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted CVPR 2025 Workshop on Recovering 6D Object Pose (R6D)</p></details> |
| **[RCGNet: RGB-based Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation with Geometric Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13623v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally, we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.</p></details> | Accepted by IROS2025 |
| **[Level-Set Parameters: Novel Representation for 3D Shape Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13502v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D shape analysis has been largely focused on traditional 3D representations of point clouds and meshes, but the discrete nature of these data makes the analysis susceptible to variations in input resolutions. Recent development of neural fields brings in level-set parameters from signed distance functions as a novel, continuous, and numerical representation of 3D shapes, where the shape surfaces are defined as zero-level-sets of those functions. This motivates us to extend shape analysis from the traditional 3D data to these novel parameter data. Since the level-set parameters are not Euclidean like point clouds, we establish correlations across different shapes by formulating them as a pseudo-normal distribution, and learn the distribution prior from the respective dataset. To further explore the level-set parameters with shape transformations, we propose to condition a subset of these parameters on rotations and translations, and generate them with a hypernetwork. This simplifies the pose-related shape analysis compared to using traditional data. We demonstrate the promise of the novel representations through applications in shape classification (arbitrary poses), retrieval, and 6D object pose estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask6D: Masked Pose Priors For 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06486v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous end-to-end pose estimation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2024. 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Computer Vision for Objects used in Group Work: Challenges and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00224v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive and spatially aware technologies are transforming educational frameworks, particularly in K-12 settings where hands-on exploration fosters deeper conceptual understanding. However, during collaborative tasks, existing systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale. This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods' object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results, and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AIED 2025 Late Breaking Results Track</p></details> |
| **[Monocular One-Shot Metric-Depth Alignment for RGB-Based Robot Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17110v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision, which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras), and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[XYZ-IBD: A High-precision Bin-picking Dataset for Object 6D Pose Estimation Capturing Real-world Industrial Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00599v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce XYZ-IBD, a bin-picking dataset for 6D pose estimation that captures real-world industrial complexity, including challenging object geometries, reflective materials, severe occlusions, and dense clutter. The dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on household objects, which approach saturation,XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved realistic industrial conditions. The dataset features 15 texture-less, metallic, and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density, replicating the challenges of real-world bin-picking. XYZ-IBD was collected using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view real-world scenes, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks. By capturing the complexity of real-world bin-picking scenarios, XYZ-IBD introduces more realistic and challenging problems for future research.

| **[In-Hand Object Pose Estimation via Visual-Tactile Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10787v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate in-hand pose estimation is crucial for robotic object manipulation, but visual occlusion remains a major challenge for vision-based approaches. This paper presents an approach to robotic in-hand object pose estimation, combining visual and tactile information to accurately determine the position and orientation of objects grasped by a robotic hand. We address the challenge of visual occlusion by fusing visual information from a wrist-mounted RGB-D camera with tactile information from vision-based tactile sensors mounted on the fingertips of a robotic gripper. Our approach employs a weighting and sensor fusion module to combine point clouds from heterogeneous sensor types and control each modality's contribution to the pose estimation process. We use an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm adapted for weighted point clouds to estimate the 6D object pose. Our experiments show that incorporating tactile information significantly improves pose estimation accuracy, particularly when occlusion is high. Our method achieves an average pose estimation error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only baselines by up to 20%. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to perform precise object manipulation in a real-world insertion task.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Accurate and efficient zero-shot 6D pose estimation with frozen foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09784v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable 8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.</p></details> | Technical report |

Yet, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating 6D pose estimation methods under realistic industrial conditions, as most datasets focus on household objects in domestic settings, while the few available industrial datasets are limited to artificial setups with objects placed on tables. To bridge this gap, we introduce CHIP, the first dataset designed for 6D pose estimation of chairs manipulated by a robotic arm in a real-world industrial environment. CHIP includes seven distinct chairs captured using three different RGBD sensing technologies and presents unique challenges, such as distractor objects with fine-grained differences and severe occlusions caused by the robotic arm and human operators. CHIP comprises 77,811 RGBD images annotated with ground-truth 6D poses automatically derived from the robot's kinematics, averaging 11,115 annotations per chair. We benchmark CHIP using three zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods, assessing performance across different sensor types, localization priors, and occlusion levels. Results show substantial room for improvement, highlighting the unique challenges posed by the dataset. CHIP will be publicly released.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[UA-Pose: Uncertainty-Aware 6D Object Pose Estimation and Online Object Completion with Partial References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07996v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects. However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed 3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating 6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are incomplete or partially captured.

Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, effectively utilizing such speeds remains a challenge due to the limitations of RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and fail to provide real-time responsiveness. Event cameras, with their asynchronous operation, and low-latency sensing, offer a promising alternative for high-speed robotic perception. In this work, we introduce MTevent, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation and moving object detection in highly dynamic environments with large detection distances. Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an RGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16 unique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles, varying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine high-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions, making it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To establish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's FoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with ground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in such dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve perception models and foster further research in high-speed robotic vision.

The vast majority of existing methods rely on instance-specific CAD models or require depth sensors to resolve geometric ambiguities, making them impractical for real-world agricultural applications. In this work, we introduce PLANTPose, a novel framework for category-level 6D pose estimation that operates purely on RGB input. PLANTPose predicts both the 6D pose and deformation parameters relative to a base mesh, allowing a single category-level CAD model to adapt to unseen instances. This enables accurate pose estimation across varying shapes without relying on instance-specific data. To enhance realism and improve generalization, we also leverage Stable Diffusion to refine synthetic training images with realistic texturing, mimicking variations due to ripeness and environmental factors and bridging the domain gap between synthetic data and the real world. Our evaluations on a challenging benchmark that includes bananas of various shapes, sizes, and ripeness status demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in handling large intraclass variations while maintaining accurate 6D pose predictions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art RGB-based approach MegaPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

| **[RefPose: Leveraging Reference Geometric Correspondences for Accurate 6D Pose Estimation of Unseen Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10841v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of unseen objects from monocular RGB images remains a challenging problem, especially due to the lack of prior object-specific knowledge. To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to object pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric correspondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using object templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric correspondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage, RefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the generated references and iteratively refines the pose through a render-and-compare approach. To enhance this estimation, we introduce a correlation volume-guided attention mechanism that effectively captures correlations between the query and reference images. Unlike traditional methods that depend on pre-defined object models, RefPose dynamically adapts to new object shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence. This results in robust performance across previously unseen objects. Extensive evaluation on the BOP benchmark datasets shows that RefPose achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining a competitive runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

These requirements make generalization to novel objects difficult for which neither 3D models nor multi-view images may be available. To address this, we propose a novel method One2Any that estimates the relative 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) object pose using only a single reference-single query RGB-D image, without prior knowledge of its 3D model, multi-view data, or category constraints. We treat object pose estimation as an encoding-decoding process, first, we obtain a comprehensive Reference Object Pose Embedding (ROPE) that encodes an object shape, orientation, and texture from a single reference view. Using this embedding, a U-Net-based pose decoding module produces Reference Object Coordinate (ROC) for new views, enabling fast and accurate pose estimation. This simple encoding-decoding framework allows our model to be trained on any pair-wise pose data, enabling large-scale training and demonstrating great scalability. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model generalizes well to novel objects, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness even rivaling methods that require multi-view or CAD inputs, at a fraction of compute.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

The complexity of a pose estimation task depends on the unknown variables related to the target object. While instance-level methods already excel for opaque and Lambertian objects, category-level and open-set methods, where texture, shape, and size are partially or entirely unknown, still struggle with these basic material properties. Since texture is unknown in these scenarios, it cannot be used for disambiguating object symmetries, another core challenge of 6D object pose estimation. The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of unknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions. This paper compares datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithms for solving 6D pose estimation on the category-level. Based on this comparison, we analyze how to bridge category-level and open-set object pose estimation to reach generalization and provide actionable recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Austrian Robotics Workshop 2025</p></details> |

Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have shown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal. However, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems: (1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is significantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and occlusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack crucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations, we propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns correspondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and robot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware point clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand. These point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also incorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in six real-world tasks, surpassing other baselines by a large margin. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness of CordViP to different objects, viewpoints, and scenarios.

In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have similar rankings on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21--29% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still -35% behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023), and the 2D detection stage is consequently the main bottleneck of existing pipelines for 6D localization/detection of unseen objects.

While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Most recent 6D object pose methods rely on refinement to get accurate results. However, most existing refinement methods either suffer from noises in establishing correspondences, or rely on retraining for novel objects. SCFlow2 is based on the SCFlow model designed for refinement with shape constraint, but formulates the additional depth as a regularization in the iteration via 3D scene flow for RGBD frames. The key design of SCFlow2 is an introduction of geometry constraints into the training of recurrent matching network, by combining the rigid-motion embeddings in 3D scene flow and 3D shape prior of the target. We train SCFlow2 on a combination of dataset Objaverse, GSO and ShapeNet, and evaluate on BOP datasets with novel objects. After using our method as a post-processing, most state-of-the-art methods produce significantly better results, without any retraining or fine-tuning.

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |

Based on our novel positional depth encoding, we enable stable depth density and depth distribution invariant feature extraction. We achieve performance improvements and SOTA results across a spectrum of relevant RGBD downstream tasks - without the necessity of finetuning the encoder. Most notably, we achieve 56.05 mIoU on SUN-RGBD segmentation, 88.3 RMSE on Void's depth completion, and 83.8 Top 1 accuracy on NYUv2 scene classification. In 6D-object pose estimation, we outperform our predecessors of DinoV2, EVA-02, and Omnivore and achieve SOTA results for non-finetuned encoders in several related RGBD downstream tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Recently, the emergence of deep learning reveals the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict reliable 6D poses. Given that direct pose regression networks currently exhibit suboptimal performance, most methods still resort to traditional techniques to varying degrees. For example, top-performing methods often adopt an indirect strategy by first establishing 2D-3D or 3D-3D correspondences followed by applying the RANSAC-based PnP or Kabsch algorithms, and further employing ICP for refinement. Despite the performance enhancement, the integration of traditional techniques makes the networks time-consuming and not end-to-end trainable. Orthogonal to them, this paper introduces a fully learning-based object pose estimator. In this work, we first perform an in-depth investigation of both direct and indirect methods and propose a simple yet effective Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDRN) to learn the 6D pose from monocular images in an end-to-end manner. Afterwards, we introduce a geometry-guided pose refinement module, enhancing pose accuracy when extra depth data is available. Guided by the predicted coordinate map, we build an end-to-end differentiable architecture that establishes robust and accurate 3D-3D correspondences between the observed and rendered RGB-D images to refine the pose. Our enhanced pose estimation pipeline GDRNPP (GDRN Plus Plus) conquered the leaderboard of the BOP Challenge for two consecutive years, becoming the first to surpass all prior methods that relied on traditional techniques in both accuracy and speed.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Omni6D, a comprehensive RGBD dataset featuring a wide range of categories and varied backgrounds, elevating the task to a more realistic context. 1) The dataset comprises an extensive spectrum of 166 categories, 4688 instances adjusted to the canonical pose, and over 0.8 million captures, significantly broadening the scope for evaluation. 2) We introduce a symmetry-aware metric and conduct systematic benchmarks of existing algorithms on Omni6D, offering a thorough exploration of new challenges and insights. 3) Additionally, we propose an effective fine-tuning approach that adapts models from previous datasets to our extensive vocabulary setting.

While prior works use large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rewards, these approaches are largely limited to simple tasks with well-defined rewards, such as pick-and-place. This limitation arises because LLMs struggle to interpret complex scenes compressed into text or code due to their restricted input modality, while VLM-based rewards, though better at visual perception, remain limited by their less expressive output modality. To address these challenges, we leverage the imagination capability of general-purpose video generation models. Given an initial simulation frame and a textual task description, the video generation model produces a video demonstrating task completion with correct semantics. We then extract rich supervisory signals from the generated video, including 6D object pose sequences, 2D segmentations, and estimated depth, to facilitate task learning in simulation. Our approach significantly improves supervision quality for complex embodied tasks, enabling large-scale training in simulators.</p></details> |  |

Zero-shot approaches eliminate the need for training but depend on pre-existing 3D object models, which are often impractical to obtain. To address this, we propose a language-guided few-shot 3D reconstruction method, reconstructing a 3D mesh from few input images. In the proposed pipeline, receives a set of input images and a language query. A combination of GroundingDINO and Segment Anything Model outputs segmented masks from which a sparse point cloud is reconstructed with VGGSfM. Subsequently, the mesh is reconstructed with the Gaussian Splatting method SuGAR. In a final cleaning step, artifacts are removed, resulting in the final 3D mesh of the queried object. We evaluate the method in terms of accuracy and quality of the geometry and texture. Furthermore, we study the impact of imaging conditions such as viewing angle, number of input images, and image overlap on 3D object reconstruction quality, efficiency, and computational scalability.</p></details> | under review |

Existing studies either require multi-stage pose regression or rely on 2D-3D feature matching. Though these approaches have shown promising results, they rely heavily on appearance information, requiring complex input (i.e., multi-view reference input, depth, or CAD models) and intricate pipeline (i.e., feature extraction-SfM-2D to 3D matching-PnP). We propose AxisPose, a model-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation, which fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing methods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM and PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by leveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects without reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation Module (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes through a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the gradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain the geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated tri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module (TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose achieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N instances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with great potential for generalization to unseen-object level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active 6D Pose Estimation for Textureless Objects using Multi-View RGB Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03726v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of textureless objects from RBG images is an important problem in robotics. Due to appearance ambiguities, rotational symmetries, and severe occlusions, single-view based 6D pose estimators are still unable to handle a wide range of objects, motivating research towards multi-view pose estimation and next-best-view prediction that addresses these limitations. In this work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for estimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our approach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a sequential two-step process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency. First, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth ambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify the subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through canonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then introduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera viewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty and enhancing pose accuracy. We evaluate our method on the public ROBI dataset as well as on a transparent object dataset that we created. When evaluated using the same camera viewpoints, our multi-view pose estimation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by leveraging our next-best-view strategy, our method achieves high object pose accuracy with substantially fewer viewpoints than heuristic-based policies.</p></details> |  |

| **[Increasing the Task Flexibility of Heavy-Duty Manipulators Using Visual 6D Pose Estimation of Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19169v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in visual 6D pose estimation of objects using deep neural networks have enabled novel ways of vision-based control for heavy-duty robotic applications. In this study, we present a pipeline for the precise tool positioning of heavy-duty, long-reach (HDLR) manipulators using advanced machine vision. A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration to estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI). Based on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with motion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool positioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and control methods prevalent in the industry. The proposed methodology comprises orientation and position alignment based on the visually estimated OOI poses, whereas camera-to-robot calibration is conducted based on motion utilizing visual SLAM. The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from rigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via image-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation, only synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world setting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results demonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2 mm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to increase the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR manipulators.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances improving speed and accuracy in pose estimation, finding a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy poses significant challenges in dynamic environments. Most current algorithms lack scalability in estimation time, especially for diverse datasets, and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are often too slow. This study focuses on developing a fast and scalable set of pose estimators based on GDRNPP to meet or exceed current benchmarks in accuracy and robustness, particularly addressing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off essential in real-time scenarios. We propose the AMIS algorithm to tailor the utilized model according to an application-specific trade-off between inference time and accuracy. We further show the effectiveness of the AMIS-based model choice on four prominent benchmark datasets (LM-O, YCB-V, T-LESS, and ITODD).</p></details> |  |

However, the edges of clear objects have the highest contrast, which leads to stable and prominent features. We propose a novel approach by incorporating edge detection in a pre-processing step for the tasks of object detection and object pose estimation. We conducted experiments to investigate the effect of edge detectors on transparent objects. We examine the performance of the state-of-the-art 6D object pose estimation pipeline GDR-Net and the object detector YOLOX when applying different edge detectors as pre-processing steps (i.e., Canny edge detection with and without color information, and holistically-nested edges (HED)). We evaluate the physically-based rendered dataset Trans6D-32 K of transparent objects with parameters proposed by the BOP Challenge. Our results indicate that applying edge detection as a pre-processing enhances performance for certain objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at First Austrian Symposium on AI, Robotics, and Vision (AIROV 2024)</p></details> |

While existing methods can estimate the precise 6D pose of objects, they heavily rely on curated CAD models or reference images, the preparation of which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, 3D models or reference images may not be available in advance and instant robot reaction is desired. In this work, we propose a novel framework named HIPPo, which eliminates the need for curated CAD models and reference images by harnessing image-to-3D priors from Diffusion Models, enabling model-free zero-shot 6D pose estimation. Specifically, we construct HIPPo Dreamer, a rapid image-to-mesh model built on a multiview Diffusion Model and a 3D reconstruction foundation model. Our HIPPo Dreamer can generate a 3D mesh of any unseen objects from a single glance in just a few seconds. Then, as more observations are acquired, we propose to continuously refine the diffusion prior mesh model by joint optimization of object geometry and appearance. This is achieved by a measurement-guided scheme that gradually replaces the plausible diffusion priors with more reliable online observations. Consequently, HIPPo can instantly estimate and track the 6D pose of a novel object and maintain a complete mesh for immediate robotic applications. Thorough experiments on various benchmarks show that HIPPo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 6D object pose estimation when prior reference images are limited.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often struggle with achieving high accuracy in both object detection and precise pose estimation simultaneously. This study proposes an improved 6D object detection and pose estimation pipeline based on the existing 6D-VNet framework, enhanced by integrating a Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC) and a High-Resolution Network (HRNet) backbone. By leveraging the strengths of HTC's multi-stage refinement process and HRNet's ability to maintain high-resolution representations, our approach significantly improves detection accuracy and pose estimation precision. Furthermore, we introduce advanced post-processing techniques and a novel model integration strategy that collectively contribute to superior performance on public and private benchmarks. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models, making it a valuable contribution to the domain of 6D object detection and pose estimation.</p></details> |  |

Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve ambiguous cases due to geometrically symmetric objects that is based on visual features. We comprehensively evaluate FreeZe across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, which include over a hundred 3D objects and 20,000 images captured in various scenarios. FreeZe consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches, including competitors extensively trained on synthetic 6D pose estimation data.

Traditional methods often rely on deep learning with grid based data structures but struggle to capture complex dependencies among extracted features. To overcome this, we introduce a graph based representation derived directly from images, where spatial temporal features of each pixel serve as nodes, and relationships between them are defined through node connectivity and spatial interactions. We also employ feature selection mechanisms that use spatial attention and self attention distillation, along with a Legendre convolution layer leveraging the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials for numerical stability. Experiments on the LINEMOD, Occluded LINEMOD, and YCB Video datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms nine existing approaches and achieves state of the art benchmark in object pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, they present a major challenge due to their distinct refractive and reflective properties when it comes to accurately estimating the 6D pose. To solve this, we present ReFlow6D, a novel method for transparent object 6D pose estimation that harnesses the refractive-intermediate representation. Unlike conventional approaches, our method leverages a feature space impervious to changes in RGB image space and independent of depth information. Drawing inspiration from image matting, we model the deformation of the light path through transparent objects, yielding a unique object-specific intermediate representation guided by light refraction that is independent of the environment in which objects are observed. By integrating these intermediate features into the pose estimation network, we show that ReFlow6D achieves precise 6D pose estimation of transparent objects, using only RGB images as input. Our method further introduces a novel transparent object compositing loss, fostering the generation of superior refractive-intermediate features. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TOD and Trans32K-6D datasets. Robot grasping experiments further demonstrate that ReFlow6D's pose estimation accuracy effectively translates to real-world robotics task.

Existing real-world datasets primarily focus on table-top grasping scenarios, where a robot arm is placed in a fixed position and the objects are centralized within the FOV of fixed external camera(s). Assessing performance on such datasets may not accurately reflect the challenges encountered in everyday grasping and mobile manipulation tasks within kitchen environments such as retrieving objects from higher shelves, sinks, dishwashers, ovens, refrigerators, or microwaves. To address this gap, we present KITchen, a novel benchmark designed specifically for estimating the 6D poses of objects located in diverse positions within kitchen settings. For this purpose, we recorded a comprehensive dataset comprising around 205k real-world RGBD images for 111 kitchen objects captured in two distinct kitchens, utilizing a humanoid robot with its egocentric perspectives. Subsequently, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline, to streamline the labeling process of such datasets, resulting in the generation of 2D object labels, 2D object segmentation masks, and 6D object poses with minimal human effort. The benchmark, the dataset, and the annotation pipeline will be publicly available at https://kitchen-dataset.github.io/KITchen.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publishing at The 2024 IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots</p></details> |

Our approach relies on the evaluation of discrepancies in the geometry of the observed object, in particular its respective estimated back-projection in 3D, against a putative functional shape representation comprising mixtures of Gaussian Processes, that act as a template. Each Gaussian Process is trained to yield a fragment of the object's surface in a radial fashion with respect to designated reference points. We further define a pose confidence measure as the average probability of pixel back-projections in the Gaussian mixture. The goal of our experiments is two-fold. a) We demonstrate that our functional representation is sufficiently accurate as a shape template on which the probability of back-projected object points can be evaluated, and, b) we show that the resulting confidence scores based on these probabilities are indeed a consistent quality measure of pose.</p></details> |  |

Most current approaches are restricted to specific instances with known models or require ground truth depth information or point cloud captures from LIDAR. We tackle the harder problem of pose estimation for category-level objects from a single RGB image. We propose a novel solution that eliminates the need for specific object models or depth information. Our method utilises score-based diffusion models to generate object pose hypotheses to model the distribution of possible poses for the object. Unlike previous methods that rely on costly trained likelihood estimators to remove outliers before pose aggregation using mean pooling, we introduce a simpler approach using Mean Shift to estimate the mode of the distribution as the final pose estimate. Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the REAL275 dataset by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

Through evaluation of the model performance with respect to the distribution of object poses and occlusions, we discover regions of high error and generate realistic training samples to specifically target these regions.

In particular, partial observability, occlusions, and object symmetries eventually result in pose ambiguity. To account for this multimodality, this work proposes training a diffusion-based generative model for 6D object pose estimation. During inference, the trained generative model allows for sampling multiple particles, i.e., pose hypotheses. To distill this information into a single pose estimate, we propose two novel and effective pose selection strategies that do not require any additional training or computationally intensive operations. Moreover, while many existing methods for pose estimation primarily focus on the image domain and only incorporate depth information for final pose refinement, our model solely operates on point cloud data. The model thereby leverages recent advancements in point cloud processing and operates upon an SE(3)-equivariant latent space that forms the basis for the particle selection strategies and allows for improved inference times. Our thorough experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach on the Linemod dataset and showcase the effectiveness of our design choices.

Occlusion and incomplete object visibility are common challenges in this task, but existing pose refinement methods often struggle to handle these issues effectively. To tackle this problem, we propose a global motion-guided recurrent flow estimation method called GMFlow for pose estimation. GMFlow overcomes local ambiguities caused by occlusion or missing parts by seeking global explanations. We leverage the object's structural information to extend the motion of visible parts of the rigid body to its invisible regions. Specifically, we capture global contextual information through a linear attention mechanism and guide local motion information to generate global motion estimates. Furthermore, we introduce object shape constraints in the flow iteration process, making flow estimation suitable for pose estimation scenarios. Experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in accuracy while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GS2Pose: Two-stage 6D Object Pose Estimation Guided by Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03807v3)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a new method for accurate and robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects, named GS2Pose. By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose can utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD model, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input. Specifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse estimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight U-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is designed. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images. GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly competitive results. The code for GS2Pose will soon be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

MQAT guides a systematic gradated modular quantization sequence and determines module-specific bit precisions, leading to quantized models that outperform those produced by state-of-the-art uniform and mixed-precision quantization techniques. Our experiments showcase the generality of MQAT across datasets, architectures, and quantization algorithms. Remarkably, MQAT-trained quantized models achieve a significant accuracy boost (>7%) over the baseline full-precision network while reducing model size by a factor of 4x or more.

However, existing classic pose estimation methods are object-specific, which can only handle the specific objects seen during training. When applied to a novel object, these methods necessitate a cumbersome onboarding process, which involves extensive dataset preparation and model retraining. The extensive duration and resource consumption of onboarding limit their practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce ZeroPose, a novel zero-shot framework that performs pose estimation following a Discovery-Orientation-Registration (DOR) inference pipeline. This framework generalizes to novel objects without requiring model retraining. Given the CAD model of a novel object, ZeroPose enables in seconds onboarding time to extract visual and geometric embeddings from the CAD model as a prompt. With the prompting of the above embeddings, DOR can discover all related instances and estimate their 6D poses without additional human interaction or presupposing scene conditions. Compared with existing zero-shot methods solved by the render-and-compare paradigm, the DOR pipeline formulates the object pose estimation into a feature-matching problem, which avoids time-consuming online rendering and improves efficiency. Experimental results on the seven datasets show that ZeroPose as a zero-shot method achieves comparable performance with object-specific training methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot method with 50x inference speed improvement.</p></details> |  |

This problem is of particular interest for many practical applications in industrial tasks such as quality control, bin picking, and robotic manipulation, where both speed and accuracy are critical for real-world deployment. Current models, both classical and deep-learning-based, often struggle with the trade-off between accuracy and latency. Our research focuses on enhancing the speed of a prominent state-of-the-art deep learning model, GDRNPP, while keeping its high accuracy. We employ several techniques to reduce the model size and improve inference time. These techniques include using smaller and quicker backbones, pruning unnecessary parameters, and distillation to transfer knowledge from a large, high-performing model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed configuration maintains accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art while significantly improving inference time.

State-of-the-art 6D object pose estimators directly predict an object pose given an object observation. Due to the ill-posed nature of the pose estimation problem, where multiple different poses can correspond to a single observation, generating additional plausible estimates per observation can be valuable. To address this, we reformulate the state-of-the-art algorithm GDRNPP and introduce EPRO-GDR (End-to-End Probabilistic Geometry-Guided Regression). Instead of predicting a single pose per detection, we estimate a probability density distribution of the pose. Using the evaluation procedure defined by the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) Challenge, we test our approach on four of its core datasets and demonstrate superior quantitative results for EPRO-GDR on LM-O, YCB-V, and ITODD. Our probabilistic solution shows that predicting a pose distribution instead of a single pose can improve state-of-the-art single-view pose estimation while providing the additional benefit of being able to sample multiple meaningful pose candidates.</p></details> |  |

In this context, RGB image and point-cloud observations are two commonly used modalities in visual-based robotic manipulation, but each of these modalities have their own limitations. Commercial point-cloud observations often suffer from issues like sparse sampling and noisy output due to the limits of the emission-reception imaging principle. On the other hand, RGB images, while rich in texture information, lack essential depth and 3D information crucial for robotic manipulation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an image-only robotic manipulation framework that leverages an eye-on-hand monocular camera installed on the robot's parallel gripper. By moving with the robot gripper, this camera gains the ability to actively perceive object from multiple perspectives during the manipulation process. This enables the estimation of 6D object poses, which can be utilized for manipulation. While, obtaining images from more and diverse viewpoints typically improves pose estimation, it also increases the manipulation time. To address this trade-off, we employ a reinforcement learning policy to synchronize the manipulation strategy with active perception, achieving a balance between 6D pose accuracy and manipulation efficiency. Our experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments showcase the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our approach. %, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve robust real-world robotic manipulation through active pose estimation.

To detect and grasp novel objects, zero-shot pose estimators determine poses without prior knowledge. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have shown considerable advances in robotics applications by establishing an understanding between language input and image input. In our work, we take advantage of VLMs zero-shot capabilities and translate this ability to 6D object pose estimation. We propose a novel framework for promptable zero-shot 6D object pose estimation using language embeddings. The idea is to derive a coarse location of an object based on the relevancy map of a language-embedded NeRF reconstruction and to compute the pose estimate with a point cloud registration method. Additionally, we provide an analysis of LERF's suitability for open-set object pose estimation. We examine hyperparameters, such as activation thresholds for relevancy maps and investigate the zero-shot capabilities on an instance- and category-level.

Object 3D reconstruction methods offer an alternative, among which recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) afford a compelling potential. Yet its performance still suffers and tends to overfit with fewer input views. Embracing this challenge, we introduce SGPose, a novel framework for sparse view object pose estimation using Gaussian-based methods. Given as few as ten views, SGPose generates a geometric-aware representation by starting with a random cuboid initialization, eschewing reliance on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline-derived geometry as required by traditional 3DGS methods. SGPose removes the dependence on CAD models by regressing dense 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model from sparse input and random initialization, while the geometric-consistent depth supervision and online synthetic view warping are key to the success. Experiments on typical benchmarks, especially on the Occlusion LM-O dataset, demonstrate that SGPose outperforms existing methods even under sparse view constraints, under-scoring its potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

GS-Pose begins with a set of posed RGB images of a previously unseen object and builds three distinct representations stored in a database. At inference, GS-Pose operates sequentially by locating the object in the input image, estimating its initial 6D pose using a retrieval approach, and refining the pose with a render-and-compare method. The key insight is the application of the appropriate object representation at each stage of the process. In particular, for the refinement step, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique that offers high rendering speed and relatively low optimization time. Off-the-shelf toolchains and commodity hardware, such as mobile phones, can be used to capture new objects to be added to the database.

We initially detect instance-wise keypoints with a YOLOv8s model to compute 6D pose estimates of known objects by solving PnP. We use a ray tracing approach to track a geometric scene graph consisting of mesh models of object instances. In contrast to classical point-to-point matching, this leads to more robust results, especially under occlusions between objects instances. We show that using this hybrid strategy leads to robust self-localization, pre-segmentation of the range sensor data and accurate pose tracking of objects using the same environmental representation. All detected objects are integrated into a semantic scene graph. This scene graph then serves as a front end to a semantic mapping framework to allow spatial reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certifying Robustness of Learning-Based Keypoint Detection and Pose Estimation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00117v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the certification of the local robustness of vision-based two-stage 6D object pose estimation. The two-stage method for object pose estimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural network-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods' robustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on their local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust estimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform the certification of local robustness into neural network verification for classification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output specifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate verification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear operations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of injecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull representation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict semantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we propagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then formulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the setting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each pixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear, classification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both sound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on realistic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to certify the robustness of large-scale, keypoint-based pose estimation given images in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Unlike most existing real-world object-centric datasets which only come with RGB capturing, the direct capture of the depth channel allows better 3D annotations and broader downstream applications. WildRGB-D comprises large-scale category-level RGB-D object videos, which are taken using an iPhone to go around the objects in 360 degrees. It contains around 8500 recorded objects and nearly 20000 RGB-D videos across 46 common object categories. These videos are taken with diverse cluttered backgrounds with three setups to cover as many real-world scenarios as possible: (i) a single object in one video; (ii) multiple objects in one video; and (iii) an object with a static hand in one video. The dataset is annotated with object masks, real-world scale camera poses, and reconstructed aggregated point clouds from RGBD videos. We benchmark four tasks with WildRGB-D including novel view synthesis, camera pose estimation, object 6d pose estimation, and object surface reconstruction. Our experiments show that the large-scale capture of RGB-D objects provides a large potential to advance 3D object learning.

| **[Challenges for Monocular 6D Object Pose Estimation in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12172v2)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation is a core perception task that enables, for example, object grasping and scene understanding. The widely available, inexpensive and high-resolution RGB sensors and CNNs that allow for fast inference based on this modality make monocular approaches especially well suited for robotics applications. We observe that previous surveys on object pose estimation establish the state of the art for varying modalities, single- and multi-view settings, and datasets and metrics that consider a multitude of applications. We argue, however, that those works' broad scope hinders the identification of open challenges that are specific to monocular approaches and the derivation of promising future challenges for their application in robotics. By providing a unified view on recent publications from both robotics and computer vision, we find that occlusion handling, novel pose representations, and formalizing and improving category-level pose estimation are still fundamental challenges that are highly relevant for robotics. Moreover, to further improve robotic performance, large object sets, novel objects, refractive materials, and uncertainty estimates are central, largely unsolved open challenges. In order to address them, ontological reasoning, deformability handling, scene-level reasoning, realistic datasets, and the ecological footprint of algorithms need to be improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Transactions on Robotics: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609560 arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.11827</p></details> |
| **[Shape-biased Texture Agnostic Representations for Improved Textureless and Metallic Object Detection and 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04878v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in machine learning have greatly benefited object detection and 6D pose estimation. However, textureless and metallic objects still pose a significant challenge due to few visual cues and the texture bias of CNNs. To address his issue, we propose a strategy for inducing a shape bias to CNN training. In particular, by randomizing textures applied to object surfaces during data rendering, we create training data without consistent textural cues. This methodology allows for seamless integration into existing data rendering engines, and results in negligible computational overhead for data rendering and network training. Our findings demonstrate that the shape bias we induce via randomized texturing, improves over existing approaches using style transfer. We evaluate with three detectors and two pose estimators. For the most recent object detector and for pose estimation in general, estimation accuracy improves for textureless and metallic objects. Additionally we show that our approach increases the pose estimation accuracy in the presence of image noise and strong illumination changes. Code and datasets are publicly available at github.com/hoenigpeter/randomized_texturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[FoundPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with Foundation Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18809v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FoundPose, a model-based method for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single RGB image. The method can quickly onboard new objects using their 3D models without requiring any object- or task-specific training. In contrast, existing methods typically pre-train on large-scale, task-specific datasets in order to generalize to new objects and to bridge the image-to-model domain gap. We demonstrate that such generalization capabilities can be observed in a recent vision foundation model trained in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, our method estimates the object pose from image-to-model 2D-3D correspondences, which are established by matching patch descriptors from the recent DINOv2 model between the image and pre-rendered object templates. We find that reliable correspondences can be established by kNN matching of patch descriptors from an intermediate DINOv2 layer. Such descriptors carry stronger positional information than descriptors from the last layer, and we show their importance when semantic information is ambiguous due to object symmetries or a lack of texture. To avoid establishing correspondences against all object templates, we develop an efficient template retrieval approach that integrates the patch descriptors into the bag-of-words representation and can promptly propose a handful of similarly looking templates. Additionally, we apply featuremetric alignment to compensate for discrepancies in the 2D-3D correspondences caused by coarse patch sampling. The resulting method noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for refinement-free pose estimation on the standard BOP benchmark with seven diverse datasets and can be seamlessly combined with an existing render-and-compare refinement method to achieve RGB-only state-of-the-art results.

Both factors limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a pipeline that does not require CAD models and allows training a state-of-the-art pose estimator requiring only a small set of real images as input. Our method is based on a NeuS2 object representation, that we learn through a semi-automated procedure based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and object-agnostic segmentation. We exploit the novel-view synthesis ability of NeuS2 and simple cut-and-paste augmentation to automatically generate photorealistic object renderings, which we use to train the correspondence-based SurfEmb pose estimator. We evaluate our method on the LINEMOD-Occlusion dataset, extensively studying the impact of its individual components and showing competitive performance with respect to approaches based on CAD models and PBR data. We additionally demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of our pipeline on self-collected real-world objects, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art CAD-model-free approaches, with better accuracy and robustness to mild occlusions. To allow the robotics community to benefit from this system, we will publicly release it at https://www.github.com/ethz-asl/neusurfemb.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2024. 8 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Our approach combines keypoint-based method with learnable pose regression through `keypoint-graph', which is a graph representation of the keypoints. KGpose first estimates 3D keypoints for each object using an attentional multi-modal feature fusion of RGB and point cloud features. These keypoints are estimated from each point of point cloud and converted into a graph representation. The network directly regresses 6D pose parameters for each point through a sequence of keypoint-graph embedding and local graph embedding which are designed with graph convolutions, followed by rotation and translation heads. The final pose for each object is selected from the candidates of point-wise predictions. The method achieves competitive results on the benchmark dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. KGpose enables multi-object pose estimation without requiring an extra localization step, offering a unified and efficient solution for understanding geometric contexts in complex scenes for robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable using natural language descriptions to support 6D pose estimation of unseen objects, these solutions underperform compared to model-based methods. In this work we present Horyon, an open-vocabulary VLM-based architecture that addresses relative pose estimation between two scenes of an unseen object, described by a textual prompt only. We use the textual prompt to identify the unseen object in the scenes and then obtain high-resolution multi-scale features. These features are used to extract cross-scene matches for registration. We evaluate our model on a benchmark with a large variety of unseen objects across four datasets, namely REAL275, Toyota-Light, Linemod, and YCB-Video. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, outperforming by 12.6 in Average Recall the previous best-performing approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

| **[Open-vocabulary object 6D pose estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00690v4)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the new setting of open-vocabulary object 6D pose estimation, in which a textual prompt is used to specify the object of interest. In contrast to existing approaches, in our setting (i) the object of interest is specified solely through the textual prompt, (ii) no object model (e.g., CAD or video sequence) is required at inference, and (iii) the object is imaged from two RGBD viewpoints of different scenes. To operate in this setting, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model to segment the object of interest from the scenes and to estimate its relative 6D pose. The key of our approach is a carefully devised strategy to fuse object-level information provided by the prompt with local image features, resulting in a feature space that can generalize to novel concepts. We validate our approach on a new benchmark based on two popular datasets, REAL275 and Toyota-Light, which collectively encompass 34 object instances appearing in four thousand image pairs. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both a well-established hand-crafted method and a recent deep learning-based baseline in estimating the relative 6D pose of objects in different scenes.

We train a Diffusion Model to bridge this gap using a relatively small dataset of real-world images randomly collected from unlabeled everyday objects via the DIGIT sensor. Subsequently, we employ a simulator to generate images by uniformly sampling the surface of objects from the YCB Model Set. These simulated images are then translated into the real domain using the Diffusion Model and automatically labeled to train a classifier. During this training, we further align features of the two domains using an adversarial procedure. Our evaluation is conducted on a dataset of tactile images obtained from a set of ten 3D printed YCB objects. The results reveal a total accuracy of 81.9%, a significant improvement compared to the 34.7% achieved by the classifier trained solely on simulated images. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. We further validate our approach using the classifier on a 6D object pose estimation task from tactile data.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, accepted to ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Learning based approaches typically require training data from a highly accurate CAD model or labeled training data acquired using a complex setup. We address this by learning to estimate pose from weakly labeled data without a known CAD model. We propose to use a NeRF to learn object shape implicitly which is later used to learn view-invariant features in conjunction with CNN using a contrastive loss. While NeRF helps in learning features that are view-consistent, CNN ensures that the learned features respect symmetry. During inference, CNN is used to predict view-invariant features which can be used to establish correspondences with the implicit 3d model in NeRF. The correspondences are then used to estimate the pose in the reference frame of NeRF. Our approach can also handle symmetric objects unlike other approaches using a similar training setup. Specifically, we learn viewpoint invariant, discriminative features using NeRF which are later used for pose estimation. We evaluated our approach on LM, LM-Occlusion, and T-Less dataset and achieved benchmark accuracy despite using weakly labeled data.</p></details> | 3DV 2024 |

This scarcity impedes comprehensive evaluation of model performance, limiting research advancements. Furthermore, the restricted number of available instances or categories curtails its applications. To address these issues, this paper introduces Omni6DPose, a substantial dataset characterized by its diversity in object categories, large scale, and variety in object materials. Omni6DPose is divided into three main components: ROPE (Real 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), which includes 332K images annotated with over 1.5M annotations across 581 instances in 149 categories; SOPE(Simulated 6D Object Pose Estimation Dataset), consisting of 475K images created in a mixed reality setting with depth simulation, annotated with over 5M annotations across 4162 instances in the same 149 categories; and the manually aligned real scanned objects used in both ROPE and SOPE. Omni6DPose is inherently challenging due to the substantial variations and ambiguities. To address this challenge, we introduce GenPose++, an enhanced version of the SOTA category-level pose estimation framework, incorporating two pivotal improvements: Semantic-aware feature extraction and Clustering-based aggregation. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive benchmarking analysis to evaluate the performance of previous methods on this large-scale dataset in the realms of 6D object pose estimation and pose tracking.</p></details> |  |

Given challenges like rust, high reflectivity, and absent textures, this paper introduces a point cloud based pose estimation framework (PS6D). PS6D centers on slender and multi-symmetric objects. It extracts multi-scale features through an attention-guided feature extraction module, designs a symmetry-aware rotation loss and a center distance sensitive translation loss to regress the pose of each point to the centroid of the instance, and then uses a two-stage clustering method to complete instance segmentation and pose estimation. Objects from the Sil\'eane and IPA datasets and typical workpieces from industrial practice are used to generate data and evaluate the algorithm. In comparison to the state-of-the-art approach, PS6D demonstrates an 11.5\% improvement in F$_{1_{inst}}$ and a 14.8\% improvement in Recall. The main part of PS6D has been deployed to the software of Mech-Mind, and achieves a 91.7\% success rate in bin-picking experiments, marking its application in industrial pose estimation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Domain randomization hereby plays an important role in reducing the simulation to reality gap. However, this generalization might not be effective in specialized domains like a production environment involving complex assemblies. Either the individual parts, trained with synthetic images, are integrated in much larger assemblies making them indistinguishable from their counterparts and result in false positives or are partially occluded just enough to give rise to false negatives. Domain knowledge is vital in these cases and if conceived effectively while generating synthetic data, can show a considerable improvement in bridging the simulation to reality gap. This paper focuses on synthetic data generation procedures for parts and assemblies used in a production environment. The basic procedures for synthetic data generation and their various combinations are evaluated and compared on images captured in a production environment, where results show up to 15% improvement using combinations of basic procedures. Reducing the simulation to reality gap in this way can aid to utilize the true potential of robot assisted production using artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, LaTeX; typos corrected; has not been presented in any conference or published in journal</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose MatchU, a Fuse-Describe-Match strategy for 6D pose estimation from RGB-D images. MatchU is a generic approach that fuses 2D texture and 3D geometric cues for 6D pose prediction of unseen objects. We rely on learning geometric 3D descriptors that are rotation-invariant by design. By encoding pose-agnostic geometry, the learned descriptors naturally generalize to unseen objects and capture symmetries. To tackle ambiguous associations using 3D geometry only, we fuse additional RGB information into our descriptor. This is achieved through a novel attention-based mechanism that fuses cross-modal information, together with a matching loss that leverages the latent space learned from RGB data to guide the descriptor learning process. Extensive experiments reveal the generalizability of both the RGB-D fusion strategy as well as the descriptor efficacy. Benefiting from the novel designs, MatchU surpasses all existing methods by a significant margin in terms of both accuracy and speed, even without the requirement of expensive re-training or rendering.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, in high risk scenarios such as human-robot interaction, industrial inspection, and automation, reliable pose estimates are crucial. In the last years, increasingly accurate and robust deep-learning-based approaches for 6D object pose estimation have been proposed. Many top-performing methods are not end-to-end trainable but consist of multiple stages. In the context of deep uncertainty quantification, deep ensembles are considered as state of the art since they have been proven to produce well-calibrated and robust uncertainty estimates. However, deep ensembles can only be applied to methods that can be trained end-to-end. In this work, we propose a method to quantify the uncertainty of multi-stage 6D object pose estimation approaches with deep ensembles. For the implementation, we choose SurfEmb as representative, since it is one of the top-performing 6D object pose estimation approaches in the BOP Challenge 2022. We apply established metrics and concepts for deep uncertainty quantification to evaluate the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel uncertainty calibration score for regression tasks to quantify the quality of the estimated uncertainty.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In this area, dense correspondence-based methods have achieved leading performance. However, they do not explicitly consider the local and global geometric information of different instances, resulting in poor generalization ability to unseen instances with significant shape variations. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel Instance-Adaptive and Geometric-Aware Keypoint Learning method for category-level 6D object pose estimation (AG-Pose), which includes two key designs: (1) The first design is an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Detection module, which can adaptively detect a set of sparse keypoints for various instances to represent their geometric structures. (2) The second design is a Geometric-Aware Feature Aggregation module, which can efficiently integrate the local and global geometric information into keypoint features. These two modules can work together to establish robust keypoint-level correspondences for unseen instances, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the model.Experimental results on CAMERA25 and REAL275 datasets show that the proposed AG-Pose outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin without category-specific shape priors.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

We bridge the gap between these two setups with a neural implicit representation that allows for effective novel view synthesis, keeping the downstream pose estimation modules invariant under the same unified framework. Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation. Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin. In addition, it even achieves comparable results to instance-level methods despite the reduced assumptions. Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/</p></details> |  |

Inspired by their denoising capability, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework (6D-Diff) to handle the noise and indeterminacy in object pose estimation for better performance. In our framework, to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondence, we formulate 2D keypoints detection as a reverse diffusion (denoising) process. To facilitate such a denoising process, we design a Mixture-of-Cauchy-based forward diffusion process and condition the reverse process on the object features. Extensive experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 CAMERA-READY</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose HOIDiffusion for generating realistic and diverse 3D hand-object interaction data. Our model is a conditional diffusion model that takes both the 3D hand-object geometric structure and text description as inputs for image synthesis. This offers a more controllable and realistic synthesis as we can specify the structure and style inputs in a disentangled manner. HOIDiffusion is trained by leveraging a diffusion model pre-trained on large-scale natural images and a few 3D human demonstrations. Beyond controllable image synthesis, we adopt the generated 3D data for learning 6D object pose estimation and show its effectiveness in improving perception systems.

| **[GenFlow: Generalizable Recurrent Flow for 6D Pose Refinement of Novel Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11510v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the progress of learning-based methods for 6D object pose estimation, the trade-off between accuracy and scalability for novel objects still exists. Specifically, previous methods for novel objects do not make good use of the target object's 3D shape information since they focus on generalization by processing the shape indirectly, making them less effective. We present GenFlow, an approach that enables both accuracy and generalization to novel objects with the guidance of the target object's shape. Our method predicts optical flow between the rendered image and the observed image and refines the 6D pose iteratively. It boosts the performance by a constraint of the 3D shape and the generalizable geometric knowledge learned from an end-to-end differentiable system. We further improve our model by designing a cascade network architecture to exploit the multi-scale correlations and coarse-to-fine refinement. GenFlow ranked first on the unseen object pose estimation benchmarks in both the RGB and RGB-D cases. It also achieves performance competitive with existing state-of-the-art methods for the seen object pose estimation without any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic Task Success Evaluation Under Multi-modal Non-Parametric Object Pose Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10874v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D object pose estimation is essential for various robotic tasks. Uncertain pose estimates can lead to task failures; however, a certain degree of error in the pose estimates is often acceptable. Hence, by quantifying errors in the object pose estimate and acceptable errors for task success, robots can make informed decisions. This is a challenging problem as both the object pose uncertainty and acceptable error for the robotic task are often multi-modal and cannot be parameterized with commonly used uni-modal distributions. In this paper, we introduce a framework for evaluating robotic task success under object pose uncertainty, representing both the estimated error space of the object pose and the acceptable error space for task success using multi-modal non-parametric probability distributions. The proposed framework pre-computes the acceptable error space for task success using dynamic simulations and subsequently integrates the pre-computed acceptable error space over the estimated error space of the object pose to predict the likelihood of the task success. We evaluated the proposed framework on two mobile manipulation tasks. Our results show that by representing the estimated and the acceptable error space using multi-modal non-parametric distributions, we achieve higher task success rates and fewer failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

GigaPose first leverages discriminative "templates", rendered images of the CAD models, to recover the out-of-plane rotation and then uses patch correspondences to estimate the four remaining parameters. Our approach samples templates in only a two-degrees-of-freedom space instead of the usual three and matches the input image to the templates using fast nearest-neighbor search in feature space, results in a speedup factor of 35x compared to the state of the art. Moreover, GigaPose is significantly more robust to segmentation errors. Our extensive evaluation on the seven core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated with existing refinement methods. Additionally, we show the potential of GigaPose with 3D models predicted by recent work on 3D reconstruction from a single image, relaxing the need for CAD models and making 6D pose object estimation much more convenient.

Despite the impressive progress enabled by deep learning, single-view RGB pose estimation models perform poorly in cluttered dynamic environments. Imbuing the rich temporal information contained in the video of scenes has the potential to enhance models ability to deal with the adverse effects of occlusion and the dynamic nature of the environments. Moreover, joint object detection and pose estimation models are better suited to leverage the co-dependent nature of the tasks for improving the accuracy of both tasks. To this end, we propose attention-based temporal fusion for multi-object 6D pose estimation that accumulates information across multiple frames of a video sequence. Our MOTPose method takes a sequence of images as input and performs joint object detection and pose estimation for all objects in one forward pass. It learns to aggregate both object embeddings and object parameters over multiple time steps using cross-attention-based fusion modules. We evaluate our method on the physically-realistic cluttered bin-picking dataset SynPick and the YCB-Video dataset and demonstrate improved pose estimation accuracy as well as better object detection accuracy</p></details> |  |

Fortunately, the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has showcased remarkable zero-shot transfer performance, which provides a promising solution to tackle this task. Motivated by this, we introduce SAM-6D, a novel framework designed to realize the task through two steps, including instance segmentation and pose estimation. Given the target objects, SAM-6D employs two dedicated sub-networks, namely Instance Segmentation Model (ISM) and Pose Estimation Model (PEM), to perform these steps on cluttered RGB-D images. ISM takes SAM as an advanced starting point to generate all possible object proposals and selectively preserves valid ones through meticulously crafted object matching scores in terms of semantics, appearance and geometry. By treating pose estimation as a partial-to-partial point matching problem, PEM performs a two-stage point matching process featuring a novel design of background tokens to construct dense 3D-3D correspondence, ultimately yielding the pose estimates. Without bells and whistles, SAM-6D outperforms the existing methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark for both instance segmentation and pose estimation of novel objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2024.

Current methods for scene understanding typically rely on a combination of trained models paired with either an explicit or learnt volumetric representation, all of which have their own drawbacks and limitations. We introduce DreamUp3D, a novel Object-Centric Generative Model (OCGM) designed explicitly to perform inference on a 3D scene informed only by a single RGB-D image. DreamUp3D is a self-supervised model, trained end-to-end, and is capable of segmenting objects, providing 3D object reconstructions, generating object-centric latent representations and accurate per-object 6D pose estimates. We compare DreamUp3D to baselines including NeRFs, pre-trained CLIP-features, ObSurf, and ObPose, in a range of tasks including 3D scene reconstruction, object matching and object pose estimation. Our experiments show that our model outperforms all baselines by a significant margin in real-world scenarios displaying its applicability for 3D scene understanding tasks while meeting the strict demands exhibited in robotics applications.</p></details> |  |

Recent pose estimators use dense correspondence maps and Point-to-Point algorithms to estimate object poses. The accuracy of pose estimation depends heavily on the quality of the dense correspondence maps and their ability to withstand occlusion, clutter, and challenging material properties. Currently, dense correspondence maps are estimated using image-to-image translation models based on GANs, Autoencoders, or direct regression models. However, recent advancements in image-to-image translation have led to diffusion models being the superior choice when evaluated on benchmarking datasets. In this study, we compare image-to-image translation networks based on GANs and diffusion models for the downstream task of 6D object pose estimation. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion-based image-to-image translation model outperforms the GAN, revealing potential for further improvements in 6D object pose estimation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the First Austrian Symposium on AI, Robotics, and Vision 2024</p></details> |

The prior can be used to initialize the 3D object translation and facilitate 3D object rotation estimation. Unfortunately, the object detectors that are used for this purpose do not generalize to unseen objects. Therefore, existing 6D pose estimation methods for unseen objects either assume the ground-truth object location to be known or yield inaccurate results when it is unavailable. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a method, LocPoseNet, able to robustly learn location prior for unseen objects. Our method builds upon a template matching strategy, where we propose to distribute the reference kernels and convolve them with a query to efficiently compute multi-scale correlations. We then introduce a novel translation estimator, which decouples scale-aware and scale-robust features to predict different object location parameters. Our method outperforms existing works by a large margin on LINEMOD and GenMOP. We further construct a challenging synthetic dataset, which allows us to highlight the better robustness of our method to various noise sources.

Current state-of-the-art methods typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity; however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE. Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better computational trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Differentially Private 2D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10190v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation (HPE) has become essential in numerous applications including healthcare, activity recognition, and human-computer interaction. However, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present significant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional anonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data utility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal privacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied naively. In this work, we present the first comprehensive framework for differentially private 2D human pose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance, we adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace. Next, we incorporate Feature Differential Privacy(FDP) to selectively privatize only sensitive features while retaining public visual cues. Finally, we propose a hybrid feature-projective DP framework that combines both approaches to balance privacy and accuracy for HPE. We evaluate our approach on the MPII dataset across varying privacy budgets, training strategies, and clipping norms. Our combined feature-projective method consistently outperforms vanilla DP-SGD and individual baselines, achieving up to 82.61\% mean PCKh@0.5 at $\epsilon = 0.8$, substantially closing the gap to the non-private performance. This work lays foundation for privacy-preserving human pose estimation in real-world, sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Human Finger Pointing Recognition and Estimation for Robot Directives Using a Single Web-Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02949v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gestures play a pivotal role in human communication, often serving as a preferred or complementary medium to verbal expression due to their superior spatial reference capabilities. A finger-pointing gesture conveys vital information regarding some point of interest in the environment. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), users can easily direct robots to target locations, facilitating tasks in diverse domains such as search and rescue or factory assistance. State-of-the-art approaches for visual pointing estimation often rely on depth cameras, are limited to indoor environments, and provide discrete predictions between limited targets. In this paper, we explore the development of models that enable robots to understand pointing directives from humans using a single web camera, even in diverse indoor and outdoor environments. A novel perception framework is proposed which includes a designated data-based model termed PointingNet. PointingNet recognizes the occurrence of pointing through classification followed by approximating the position and direction of the index finger with an advanced regression model. The model relies on a novel segmentation model for masking any lifted arm. While state-of-the-art human pose estimation models provide poor pointing angle estimation error of 28deg, PointingNet exhibits a mean error of less than 2deg. With the pointing information, the target location is computed, followed by robot motion planning and execution. The framework is evaluated on two robotic systems, demonstrating accurate target reaching.</p></details> |  |

On the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network, GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data for Human Pose Estimation.

| **[Adaptively Sampling-Reusing-Mixing Decomposed Gradients to Speed Up Sharpness Aware Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03763v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization but doubles the computational cost of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by requiring twice the gradient calculations per optimization step. To mitigate this, we propose Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization) without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The code is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/ajiaaa/ARSAM.</p></details> |  |

Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks (MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17 keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg \pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$) and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for telehealth and remote patient monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>All t...</summary><p>All tables, graphs and figures generated can be obtained in the Zenodo repository complementary to this work: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15088423</p></details> |
| **[Zero-shot Human Pose Estimation using Diffusion-based Inverse solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02043v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors. Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users, primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains the sparse on-body measurements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invisibility Cloak: Disappearance under Human Pose Estimation via Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07670v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite being significant in autonomous systems, Human Pose Estimation (HPE)'s potential risks to adversarial attacks have not received comparable attention with image classification or segmentation tasks. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of HPE systems to disappearance attacks, where the attacker aims to subtly alter the HPE training process via backdoor techniques so that any input image with some specific trigger will not be recognized as involving any human pose. As humans are typically at the center of HPE systems, a successful attack will severely threaten pedestrians' lives if a self-driving car incorrectly understands the front scene. To achieve the adversarial goal of disappearance, we propose \emph{IntC}, a general framework to craft an invisibility cloak in the HPE domain. By designing target HPE labels that do not represent any human pose, we propose three specific backdoor attacks based on our IntC framework. IntC-S and IntC-E, respectively designed for regression- and heatmap-based HPE techniques, concentrate the keypoints of triggered images in a tiny, imperceptible region. Further, to improve the attack's stealthiness, IntC-L designs the target poisons to capture the label outputs of typical landscape images without a human involved, achieving disappearance and reducing detectability simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our IntC methods in achieving the disappearance goal. By revealing the vulnerability of HPE to disappearance and backdoor attacks, we hope our work can raise awareness of the potential risks when HPE models are deployed in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the first attempt to estimate 3D human body mesh from sparse LiDAR point clouds. We found that the major challenge in estimating human pose and mesh from point clouds lies in the sparsity, noise, and incompletion of LiDAR point clouds. Facing these challenges, we propose an effective sparse-to-dense reconstruction scheme to reconstruct 3D human mesh. This involves estimating a sparse representation of a human (3D human pose) and gradually reconstructing the body mesh. To better leverage the 3D structural information of point clouds, we employ a cascaded graph transformer (graphormer) to introduce point cloud features during sparse-to-dense reconstruction.

While recent advancements in human motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements. During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy, smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects</p></details> |  |
| **[SDPose: Exploiting Diffusion Priors for Out-of-Domain and Robust Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24980v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization, their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD. Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving single-view pose estimation in self-contact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

| **[UniPose: Unified Cross-modality Pose Prior Propagation towards RGB-D data for Weakly Supervised 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23376v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data). UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations. This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods. Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.

| **[Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20611v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods for 3D human pose estimation face significant computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of self-attention mechanism complexity with sequence length. Recently, the Mamba model has substantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding performance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM). However, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3D joint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution structure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To address these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in this paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction and length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing effective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint sequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba model by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling it to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a Spatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial relationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal topology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing human structural relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets for testing and comparison, and the results show that the proposed method greatly reduces computational cost while achieving higher accuracy. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose Prior Learner: Unsupervised Categorical Prior Learning for Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03858v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prior represents a set of beliefs or assumptions about a system, aiding inference and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce the challenge of unsupervised categorical prior learning in pose estimation, where AI models learn a general pose prior for an object category from images in a self-supervised manner. Although priors are effective in estimating pose, acquiring them can be difficult. We propose a novel method, named Pose Prior Learner (PPL), to learn a general pose prior for any object category. PPL uses a hierarchical memory to store compositional parts of prototypical poses, from which we distill a general pose prior. This prior improves pose estimation accuracy through template transformation and image reconstruction. PPL learns meaningful pose priors without any additional human annotations or interventions, outperforming competitive baselines on both human and animal pose estimation datasets. Notably, our experimental results reveal the effectiveness of PPL using learned prototypical poses for pose estimation on occluded images. Through iterative inference, PPL leverages the pose prior to refine estimated poses, regressing them to any prototypical poses stored in memory. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Among these factors, camera viewpoints and locations have been shown to contribute significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained model.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology</p></details> |

Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on free-living home settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.</p></details> |  |

As a result, methods that achieve near-optimal in-dataset accuracy often degrade on unseen datasets. In practice, however, systems must adapt to diverse viewpoints, environments, and camera setups--conditions that differ significantly from those encountered during training, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. Measuring cross-dataset performance is a vital process, but extremely labor-intensive when done manually for human pose estimation. To address these challenges, we automate this evaluation using PoseBench3D, a standardized testing framework that enables consistent and fair cross-dataset comparisons on previously unseen data. PoseBench3D streamlines testing across four widely used 3D HPE datasets via a single, configurable interface. Using this framework, we re-evaluate 18 methods and report over 100 cross-dataset results under Protocol 1: MPJPE and Protocol 2: PA-MPJPE, revealing systematic generalization gaps and the impact of common preprocessing and dataset setup choices.

In this paper, we introduce a novel video clipping strategy to extract frames of each player's racket swing in a badminton broadcast match. These clipped frames are then processed by three existing models: one for Human Pose Estimation to obtain human skeletal joints, another for shuttlecock trajectory tracking, and the other for court line detection to determine player positions on the court. Leveraging these data as inputs, we propose Badminton Stroke-type Transformer (BST) to classify player stroke-types in singles. To the best of our knowledge, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the largest publicly available badminton video dataset (ShuttleSet), another badminton dataset (BadmintonDB), and a tennis dataset (TenniSet). These results suggest that effectively leveraging ball trajectory is a promising direction for action recognition in racket sports.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main paper, 2 pages references, 8 pages supplementary material</p></details> |

In-context learning (ICL) is a promising framework for achieving this goal due to its test-time data efficiency and rapid adaptability. However, current ICL methods rely on labor-intensive teleoperated data for training, which restricts scalability. We propose using human play videos -- continuous, unlabeled videos of people interacting freely with their environment -- as a scalable and diverse training data source. We introduce MimicDroid, which enables humanoids to perform ICL using human play videos as the only training data. MimicDroid extracts trajectory pairs with similar manipulation behaviors and trains the policy to predict the actions of one trajectory conditioned on the other. Through this process, the model acquired ICL capabilities for adapting to novel objects and environments at test time. To bridge the embodiment gap, MimicDroid first retargets human wrist poses estimated from RGB videos to the humanoid, leveraging kinematic similarity. It also applies random patch masking during training to reduce overfitting to human-specific cues and improve robustness to visual differences. To evaluate few-shot learning for humanoids, we introduce an open-source simulation benchmark with increasing levels of generalization difficulty. MimicDroid outperformed state-of-the-art methods and achieved nearly twofold higher success rates in the real world.

There is rapid development of human pose estimation methods in computer vision thanks to advances in deep learning and machine learning. However, these methods are trained on datasets that feature adults in different contexts. This work tests and compares seven popular methods (AlphaPose, DeepLabCut/DeeperCut, Detectron2, HRNet, MediaPipe/BlazePose, OpenPose, and ViTPose) on videos of infants in supine position and in more complex settings. Surprisingly, all methods except DeepLabCut and MediaPipe have competitive performance without additional finetuning, with ViTPose performing best. Next to standard performance metrics (average precision and recall), we introduce errors expressed in the neck-mid-hip (torso length) ratio and additionally study missed and redundant detections, and the reliability of the internal confidence ratings of the different methods, which are relevant for downstream tasks. Among the networks with competitive performance, only AlphaPose could run close to real time (27 fps) on our machine. We provide documented Docker containers or instructions for all the methods we used, our analysis scripts, and the processed data at https://hub.docker.com/u/humanoidsctu and https://osf.io/x465b/.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 8 figures, 22 tables</p></details> |

Notably, language offers rich HPE priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module (GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage, modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation datasets. We will release the code soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[H$_{2}$OT: Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Video Pose Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06956v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module (TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

| **[From Skin to Skeleton: Towards Biomechanically Accurate 3D Digital Humans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06607v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses. We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code, and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Aware ViT-based Framework for Monocular 6-DoF Spacecraft Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06000v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers 6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Human-Level 3D Relative Pose Estimation: Generalizable, Training-Free, with Single Reference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18453v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can easily deduce the relative pose of a previously unseen object, without labeling or training, given only a single query-reference image pair. This is arguably achieved by incorporating i) 3D/2.5D shape perception from a single image, ii) render-and-compare simulation, and iii) rich semantic cue awareness to furnish (coarse) reference-query correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D generalizable relative pose estimation method by elaborating 3D/2.5D shape perception with a 2.5D shape from an RGB-D reference, fulfilling the render-and-compare paradigm with an off-the-shelf differentiable renderer, and leveraging the semantic cues from a pretrained model like DINOv2. Specifically, our differentiable renderer takes the 2.5D rotatable mesh textured by the RGB and the semantic maps (obtained by DINOv2 from the RGB input), then renders new RGB and semantic maps (with back-surface culling) under a novel rotated view. The refinement loss comes from comparing the rendered RGB and semantic maps with the query ones, back-propagating the gradients through the differentiable renderer to refine the 3D relative pose. As a result, \emph{our method can be readily applied to unseen objects, given only a single RGB-D reference, without labeling or training}. Extensive experiments on LineMOD, LM-O, and YCB-V show that our training-free method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised methods, especially under the rigorous \texttt{Acc@5/10/15}$^\circ$ metrics and the challenging cross-dataset settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE TPAMI.

| **[An End-to-End Framework for Video Multi-Person Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01095v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation. Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and improves inference efficiency by 300%.</p></details> |  |
| **[MV-SSM: Multi-View State Space Modeling for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00649v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging, particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning (GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP (+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations.

In this paper, we propose an Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1) Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[PersPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation with Perspective Encoding and Perspective Rotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17239v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding (PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly, which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject, thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework, PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach.

| **[Bring Your Rear Cameras for Egocentric 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11652v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric 3D human pose estimation has been actively studied using cameras installed in front of a head-mounted device (HMD). While frontal placement is the optimal and the only option for some tasks, such as hand tracking, it remains unclear if the same holds for full-body tracking due to self-occlusion and limited field-of-view coverage. Notably, even the state-of-the-art methods often fail to estimate accurate 3D poses in many scenarios, such as when HMD users tilt their heads upward -- a common motion in human activities. A key limitation of existing HMD designs is their neglect of the back of the body, despite its potential to provide crucial 3D reconstruction cues. Hence, this paper investigates the usefulness of rear cameras for full-body tracking. We also show that simply adding rear views to the frontal inputs is not optimal for existing methods due to their dependence on individual 2D joint detectors without effective multi-view integration. To address this issue, we propose a new transformer-based method that refines 2D joint heatmap estimation with multi-view information and heatmap uncertainty, thereby improving 3D pose tracking. Also, we introduce two new large-scale datasets, Ego4View-Syn and Ego4View-RW, for a rear-view evaluation. Our experiments show that the new camera configurations with back views provide superior support for 3D pose tracking compared to only frontal placements. The proposed method achieves significant improvement over the current state of the art (>10% on MPJPE).

This scenario poses a challenge in extracting and leveraging multi-scale features, which is often essential for precise inference. To address this challenge, we propose a new attention mechanism, named cascaded multi-scale attention (CMSA), tailored for use in CNN-ViT hybrid architectures, to handle low-resolution inputs effectively. The design of CMSA enables the extraction and seamless integration of features across various scales without necessitating the downsampling of the input image or feature maps. This is achieved through a novel combination of grouped multi-head self-attention mechanisms with window-based local attention and cascaded fusion of multi-scale features over different scales. This architecture allows for the effective handling of features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to perform tasks such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more with low-resolution images. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in these areas with fewer parameters, showcasing its potential for broad application in real-world scenarios where capturing high-resolution images is not feasible.

The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available, and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed, the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE-RAS 24th International Conference on Humanoid Robots, Sep 2025, Seoul (Korea), South Korea</p></details> |
| **[HyperDiff: Hypergraph Guided Diffusion Model for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14431v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process. Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty, alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learnable SMPLify: A Neural Solution for Optimization-Free Human Pose Inverse Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13562v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space. Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify, generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/Learnable-SMPLify.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refinement Module based on Parse Graph for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11069v7)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parse graphs have been widely used in human pose estimation (HPE) to model the hierarchical structure and context relations of the human body, which has been shown to effectively improve robustness and accuracy. But most methods rely on parse graphs built from predefined skeletons, causing two key issues: poor integratability with other models, and complex designs with redundant parameters for hierarchy and context relation modeling of body. To address these issues, we propose a novel Refinement Module based on Parse Graph (RMPG). RMPG abandons skeleton connections and refines features by building implicit hierarchical structures and context relations between sub-feature maps, with strong integratability. Furthermore, our hierarchical network design demonstrates that RMPG can model the body's hierarchical structure and context relations with a simpler architecture and fewer parameters. RMPG operates in two stages: the top-down decomposition recursively partitions the feature map into a tree-structured hierarchy, where each node corresponds to a sub-feature map; the bottom-up composition aggregates context information to progressively refine the feature representation. Extensive experiments show that RMPG can be flexibly embedded into various methods, including our hierarchical networks, and consistently improves performance across multiple mainstream HPE benchmarks. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable Diffusion-Based Approach for Human De-Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12663v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can infer the missing parts of an occluded object by leveraging prior knowledge and visible cues. However, enabling deep learning models to accurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task. De-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions. The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as 2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | MM 2025 |
| **[AugLift: Boosting Generalization in Lifting-based 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07112v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly improves generalization performance without requiring additional data collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models (e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures. Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$, while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under review</p></details> |
| **[A Coarse-to-Fine Human Pose Estimation Method based on Two-stage Distillation and Progressive Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11212v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation. However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model. The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is more significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient High-Resolution Visual Representation Learning with State Space Model for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03174v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing long-range dependencies while preserving high-resolution visual representations is crucial for dense prediction tasks such as human pose estimation. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced global modeling through self-attention but suffer from quadratic computational complexity with respect to token count, limiting their efficiency and scalability to high-resolution inputs, especially on mobile and resource-constrained devices. State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, offer an efficient alternative by combining global receptive fields with linear computational complexity, enabling scalable and resource-friendly sequence modeling. However, when applied to dense prediction tasks, existing visual SSMs face key limitations: weak spatial inductive bias, long-range forgetting from hidden state decay, and low-resolution outputs that hinder fine-grained localization. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Visual State Space (DVSS) block, which augments visual state space models with multi-scale convolutional operations to enhance local spatial representations and strengthen spatial inductive biases. Through architectural exploration and theoretical analysis, we incorporate deformable operation into the DVSS block, identifying it as an efficient and effective mechanism to enhance semantic aggregation and mitigate long-range forgetting via input-dependent, adaptive spatial sampling. We embed DVSS into a multi-branch high-resolution architecture to build HRVMamba, a novel model for efficient high-resolution representation learning. Extensive experiments on human pose estimation, image classification, and semantic segmentation show that HRVMamba performs competitively against leading CNN-, ViT-, and SSM-based baselines.

| **[eMamba: Efficient Acceleration Framework for Mamba Models in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10370v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$ fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and 2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area, 9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ESWEEK 2025 (CODES+ISSS) conference</p></details> |

However, mmWave radar relies on the collection of reflected signals from the target, and the radar signals containing information is difficult to be fully applied. This has been a long-standing hindrance to the improvement of pose estimation accuracy. To address this major challenge, this paper introduces a probability map guided multi-format feature fusion model, ProbRadarM3F. This is a novel radar feature extraction framework using a traditional FFT method in parallel with a probability map based positional encoding method. ProbRadarM3F fuses the traditional heatmap features and the positional features, then effectively achieves the estimation of 14 keypoints of the human body. Experimental evaluation on the HuPR dataset proves the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper, outperforming other methods experimented on this dataset with an AP of 69.9 %. The emphasis of our study is focusing on the position information that is not exploited before in radar singal. This provides direction to investigate other potential non-redundant information from mmWave rader.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present Garment Inertial Poser (GaIP), a method for estimating full-body poses from sparse and loosely attached IMU sensors. We first simulate IMU recordings using an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. Our transformer-based diffusion models synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses from this challenging loose IMU data. We also demonstrate that incorporating garment-related parameters during training on loose IMU data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Our experiments show that our diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperform state-of-the-art inertial full-body pose estimators, both quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research on motion capture from such realistic sensor placements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents MultiFormer, a wireless sensing system that accurately estimates human pose through CSI. The proposed system adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor with multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model inter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The extracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on on the public MM-Fi dataset and our self-collected dataset show that the MultiFormer achieves higher accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, especially for high-mobility keypoints (wrists, elbows) that are particularly difficult for previous methods to accurately estimate.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffPose-Animal: A Language-Conditioned Diffusion Framework for Animal Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08783v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.</p></details> | 13pages,2figures |
| **[StarPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial-Temporal Autoregressive Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02056v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

| **[VOccl3D: A Video Benchmark Dataset for 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation under real Occlusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06757v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied, with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g., most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques, incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions, offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets.

We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26 three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals, with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021. As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification, resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance, even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements, including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7% improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware and inclusive robot behaviour.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |

Additionally, innovative breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1) Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2) Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation technology.</p></details> | 10 pages, 20 figures |
| **[IMUCoCo: Enabling Flexible On-Body IMU Placement for Human Pose Estimation and Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01894v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IMUs are regularly used to sense human motion, recognize activities, and estimate full-body pose. Users are typically required to place sensors in predefined locations that are often dictated by common wearable form factors and the machine learning model's training process. Consequently, despite the increasing number of everyday devices equipped with IMUs, the limited adaptability has seriously constrained the user experience to only using a few well-explored device placements (e.g., wrist and ears). In this paper, we rethink IMU-based motion sensing by acknowledging that signals can be captured from any point on the human body. We introduce IMU over Continuous Coordinates (IMUCoCo), a novel framework that maps signals from a variable number of IMUs placed on the body surface into a unified feature space based on their spatial coordinates. These features can be plugged into downstream models for pose estimation and activity recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that IMUCoCo supports accurate pose estimation in a wide range of typical and atypical sensor placements. Overall, IMUCoCo supports significantly more flexible use of IMUs for motion sensing than the state-of-the-art, allowing users to place their sensors-laden devices according to their needs and preferences. The framework also supports the ability to change device locations depending on the context and suggests placement depending on the use case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection, Pose Estimation and Segmentation for Multiple Bodies: Closing the Virtuous Circle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01562v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation methods work well on isolated people but struggle with multiple-bodies-in-proximity scenarios. Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models.

| **[Mitigating Resolution-Drift in Federated Learning: Case of Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23461v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks. However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs (teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks that rely on preserving spatial detail.</p></details> |  |

However, rapid motion and low-light conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation, we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations. Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without requiring annotations in the target domain.

| **[KASportsFormer: Kinematic Anatomy Enhanced Transformer for 3D Human Pose Estimation on Short Sports Scene Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20763v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts. Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser (LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/jw0r1n/KASportsFormer</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

In contrast, optimization-based methods excel in fine-tuning for specific cases but are generally inferior to data-driven methods in overall performance. We observe that previous optimization-based methods commonly rely on a projection constraint, which only ensures alignment in 2D space, potentially leading to the overfitting problem. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware testing-time Optimization (UAO) framework, which keeps the prior information of the pre-trained model and alleviates the overfitting problem using the uncertainty of joints. Specifically, during the training phase, we design an effective 2D-to-3D network for estimating the corresponding 3D pose while quantifying the uncertainty of each 3D joint. For optimization during testing, the proposed optimization framework freezes the pre-trained model and optimizes only a latent state. Projection loss is then employed to ensure the generated poses are well aligned in 2D space for high-quality optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the uncertainty of each joint to determine how much each joint is allowed for optimization. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework are validated through extensive experiments on challenging datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. Notably, our approach outperforms the previous best result by a large margin of 5.5\% on Human3.6M.

| **[A Structure-aware and Motion-adaptive Framework for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19852v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically, SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Spatiotemporal Multi-Camera Calibration using Freely Moving People](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12546v3)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method for spatiotemporal multi-camera calibration using freely moving people in multiview videos. Since calibrating multiple cameras and finding matches across their views are inherently interdependent, performing both in a unified framework poses a significant challenge. We address these issues as a single registration problem of matching two sets of 3D points, leveraging human motion in dynamic multi-person scenes. To this end, we utilize 3D human poses obtained from an off-the-shelf monocular 3D human pose estimator and transform them into 3D points on a unit sphere, to solve the rotation, time offset, and the association alternatingly. We employ a probabilistic approach that can jointly solve both problems of aligning spatiotemporal data and establishing correspondences through soft assignment between two views. The translation is determined by applying coplanarity constraints. The pairwise registration results are integrated into a multiview setup, and then a nonlinear optimization method is used to improve the accuracy of the camera poses, temporal offsets, and multi-person associations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method as a practical marker-free calibration tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Physics-based Human Pose Estimation from a Single Moving RGB Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17406v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods, while achieving state-of-the-art results, suffer from artifacts when the scene does not have a strictly flat ground plane or when the camera is moving. Moreover, these methods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without ground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry changes. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first non-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a dynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion with human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a physics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints for more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat scenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to obtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera trajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then refine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer. From our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle with this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar environments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses in world coordinates.</p></details> |  |

This ''data gap'' is a key challenge both for building intelligent artificial systems and for understanding human development. Egocentric video capturing children's experience--their ''training data''--is a key ingredient for comparison of humans and models and for the development of algorithmic innovations to bridge this gap. Yet there are few such datasets available, and extant data are low-resolution, have limited metadata, and importantly, represent only a small set of children's experiences. Here, we provide the first release of a large developmental egocentric video dataset--the BabyView dataset--recorded using a high-resolution camera with a large vertical field-of-view and gyroscope/accelerometer data. This 868 hour dataset includes egocentric videos from children spanning 6 months to 3 years of age in longitudinal, at-home contexts. We provide gold-standard annotations for the evaluation of speech transcription, speaker diarization, and human pose estimation, and evaluate models in each of these domains. We train self-supervised language and vision models and evaluate their transfer to out-of-distribution tasks, including syntactic structure learning, object recognition, depth estimation, and image segmentation. Although performance in each domain scales with dataset size, overall performance is relatively lower than when models are trained on curated datasets, especially in the visual domain. Our dataset stands as an open challenge for robust, human-like AI systems: how can such systems achieve human-levels of success on the same scale and distribution of training data as humans?</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables and Appendix.

While the airports are more likely to become hotspots for potential conflicts to break out which can cause serious delays to flights and several safety issues. An intelligent algorithm which renders security surveillance more effective in detecting conflicts would bring many benefits to the passengers in terms of their safety, finance, and travelling efficiency. This paper details the development of a machine learning model to classify conflicting behaviour in a crowd. HRNet is used to segment the images and then two approaches are taken to classify the poses of people in the frame via multiple classifiers. Among them, it was found that the support vector machine (SVM) achieved the most performant achieving precision of 94.37%. Where the model falls short is against ambiguous behaviour such as a hug or losing track of a subject in the frame. The resulting model has potential for deployment within an airport if improvements are made to cope with the vast number of potential passengers in view as well as training against further ambiguous behaviours which will arise in an airport setting. In turn, will provide the capability to enhance security surveillance and improve airport safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>One o...</summary><p>One of the authors has expressed privacy concerns and made a related request</p></details> |

Its place in art reflects its growing applications in industry, such as robotics. However, those interactions often remains too technical and machine-driven for people to really engage into. On the artistic side, new technologies are often not explored in their full potential and lag a bit behind, so that state-of-the-art research does not make its way up to museums and exhibitions. Machines should support people's imagination and poetry in a seamless interface to their body or soul. We propose an artistic sound installation featuring neuromorphic body sensing to support a direct yet non intrusive interaction with the visitor with the purpose of creating sound scapes together with the machine. We design a neuromorphic multihead human pose estimation neural sensor that shapes sound scapes and visual output with fine body movement control. In particular, the feature extractor is a spiking neural network tailored for a dedicated neuromorphic chip. The visitor, immersed in a sound atmosphere and a neurally processed representation of themselves that they control, experience the dialogue with a machine that thinks neurally, similarly to them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 2025 in the special track on HUMAN-AI INTERACTION IN CREATIVE ARTS AND SCIENCES</p></details> |
| **[Toward a Real-Time Framework for Accurate Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation with Geometric Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16850v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging and ill-posed problem, particularly in real-time settings and unconstrained environments. While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE ICRA 2025 (workshop: Enhancing Human Mobility: From Computer Vision-Based Motion Tracking to Wearable Assistive Robot Control), May 2025, Atlanta (Georgia), United States</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Calisthenics Skills Classification through Foreground Instance Selection and Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12292v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Calisthenics skill classification is the computer vision task of inferring the skill performed by an athlete from images, enabling automatic performance assessment and personalized analytics. Traditional methods for calisthenics skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods, achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, In International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing</p></details> |

While HAR has been extensively studied, action summarization using Wi-Fi and IMU signals in smart-home environments , which involves identifying and summarizing continuous actions, remains an emerging task. This paper introduces the novel XRF V2 dataset, designed for indoor daily activity Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and action summarization. XRF V2 integrates multimodal data from Wi-Fi signals, IMU sensors (smartphones, smartwatches, headphones, and smart glasses), and synchronized video recordings, offering a diverse collection of indoor activities from 16 volunteers across three distinct environments. To tackle TAL and action summarization, we propose the XRFMamba neural network, which excels at capturing long-term dependencies in untrimmed sensory sequences and achieves the best performance with an average mAP of 78.74, outperforming the recent WiFiTAD by 5.49 points in mAP@avg while using 35% fewer parameters. In action summarization, we introduce a new metric, Response Meaning Consistency (RMC), to evaluate action summarization performance. And it achieves an average Response Meaning Consistency (mRMC) of 0.802. We envision XRF V2 as a valuable resource for advancing research in human action localization, action forecasting, pose estimation, multimodal foundation models pre-training, synthetic data generation, and more.

| **[Joint angle model based learning to refine kinematic human pose estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11075v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet. Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.</p></details> |  |

Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis, due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait, to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset. We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models, demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for prosthesis-specific tasks.

Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation, enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions. Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in language-guided pose estimation.

While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%. We also validate the kinematic accuracy of monocular pose estimations through waveform analysis, highlighting strong correlations in joint angle estimations but limitations in velocity estimation. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of monocular pose estimation models in the context of sports, contributing valuable insights for advancing monocular pose estimation techniques in high-performance sports environments.

However, existing mmWave systems typically employ fixed-position configurations, restricting user mobility to predefined zones and limiting practical deployment scenarios. We introduce mmEgoHand, a head-mounted egocentric system for hand pose estimation to support applications such as gesture recognition, VR interaction, skill digitization and assessment, and robotic teleoperation. mmEgoHand synergistically integrates mmWave radar with inertial measurement units (IMUs) to enable dynamic perception. The IMUs actively compensate for radar interference induced by head movements, while our novel end-to-end Transformer architecture simultaneously estimates 3D hand keypoint coordinates through multi-modal sensor fusion. This dual-modality framework achieves spatial-temporal alignment of mmWave heatmaps with IMUs, overcoming viewpoint instability inherent in egocentric sensing scenarios. We further demonstrate that intermediate hand pose representations substantially improve performance in downstream task, e.g., VR gesture recognition. Extensive evaluations with 10 subjects performing 8 gestures across 3 distinct postures -- standing, sitting, lying -- achieve 90.8% recognition accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by a large margin.

In this paper, we propose Sparse Correlation and Joint Distillation (SCJD), a novel framework that balances efficiency and accuracy for 3D HPE. SCJD introduces Sparse Correlation Input Sequence Downsampling to reduce redundancy in student network inputs while preserving inter-frame correlations. For effective knowledge transfer, we propose Dynamic Joint Spatial Attention Distillation, which includes Dynamic Joint Embedding Distillation to enhance the student's feature representation using the teacher's multi-frame context feature, and Adjacent Joint Attention Distillation to improve the student network's focus on adjacent joint relationships for better spatial understanding. Additionally, Temporal Consistency Distillation aligns the temporal correlations between teacher and student networks through upsampling and global supervision.

| **[Reconstructing Close Human Interaction with Appearance and Proxemics Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02565v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.

Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the gait parameters of athletes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network with Sinusoidal Encoding for Robust Human Action Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00752v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate temporal segmentation of human actions is critical for intelligent robots in collaborative settings, where a precise understanding of sub-activity labels and their temporal structure is essential. However, the inherent noise in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g., 30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation. Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts. Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted in IROS25, Hangzhou, China</p></details> |

This paper presents a test environment that combines a Vehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the feasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and vehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian localization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach through a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations of VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a commercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is generated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and projected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation technique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle perception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP domains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in movement trajectories and joint estimation stability. The validation includes dynamic test scenarios where human avatars, both walking and cycling, are monitored under controlled conditions. Our results show a strong alignment in HPE between RW and CP test conditions for stable motion patterns, while notable inaccuracies persist under dynamic movements and occlusions, particularly for complex cyclist postures. These findings contribute to refining CP testing approaches for evaluating next-generation AI-based vehicle perception and to enhancing interaction models of automated vehicles and VRUs in CP environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Preprint for 2025 IEEE IAVVC (International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference)</p></details> |
| **[Disentangled Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04444v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based methods for monocular 3D human pose estimation have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance by directly regressing the 3D joint coordinates from the 2D pose sequence. Although some methods decompose the task into bone length and bone direction prediction based on the human anatomical skeleton to explicitly incorporate more human body prior constraints, the performance of these methods is significantly lower than that of the SOTA diffusion-based methods. This can be attributed to the tree structure of the human skeleton. Direct application of the disentangled method could amplify the accumulation of hierarchical errors, propagating through each hierarchy. Meanwhile, the hierarchical information has not been fully explored by the previous methods. To address these problems, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser is proposed, termed DDHPose. In our approach: (1) We disentangle the 3D pose and diffuse the bone length and bone direction during the forward process of the diffusion model to effectively model the human pose prior. A disentanglement loss is proposed to supervise diffusion model learning. (2) For the reverse process, we propose Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser (HSTDenoiser) to improve the hierarchical modeling of each joint. Our HSTDenoiser comprises two components: the Hierarchical-Related Spatial Transformer (HRST) and the Hierarchical-Related Temporal Transformer (HRTT). HRST exploits joint spatial information and the influence of the parent joint on each joint for spatial modeling, while HRTT utilizes information from both the joint and its hierarchical adjacent joints to explore the hierarchical temporal correlations among joints.

Advancements in neural networks have significantly alleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports broadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it depends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive game analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match recordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to identify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's flying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying on human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or unavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration method capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted an existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to accurately track player movements. Together, these contributions enable the full 3D reconstruction of a table tennis rally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVSport 2025</p></details> |
| **[Systematic Comparison of Projection Methods for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation on Fisheye Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19747v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups, ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at: https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/fishnchips</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2025</p></details> |

Conventional methods either assume high-quality inputs or employ computationally expensive cascaded processing, which limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose STAR-Pose, a spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework specifically designed for video-based human pose estimation. Our method features a novel spatial-temporal Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention, which efficiently captures long-range temporal dependencies. Moreover, it is complemented by an adaptive fusion module that integrates parallel CNN branch for local texture enhancement. We also design a pose-aware compound loss to achieve task-oriented super-resolution. This loss guides the network to reconstruct structural features that are most beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than optimizing purely for visual quality. Extensive experiments on several mainstream video HPE datasets demonstrate that STAR-Pose outperforms existing approaches. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely low-resolution (64x48) conditions while delivering 2.8x to 4.4x faster inference than cascaded approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>14pag...</summary><p>14pages 3figures, alredy submiss to PRCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Audio and Pose: A General-Purpose Framework for Video Synchronization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15937v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video synchronization-aligning multiple video streams capturing the same event from different angles-is crucial for applications such as reality TV show production, sports analysis, surveillance, and autonomous systems. Prior work has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human, multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline, leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions. Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods, identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[PoseGRAF: Geometric-Reinforced Adaptive Fusion for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14596v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing monocular 3D pose estimation methods primarily rely on joint positional features, while overlooking intrinsic directional and angular correlations within the skeleton. As a result, they often produce implausible poses under joint occlusions or rapid motion changes. To address these challenges, we propose the PoseGRAF framework. We first construct a dual graph convolutional structure that separately processes joint and bone graphs, effectively capturing their local dependencies. A Cross-Attention module is then introduced to model interdependencies between bone directions and joint features. Building upon this, a dynamic fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate both feature types by leveraging the relational dependencies between joints and bones. An improved Transformer encoder is further incorporated in a residual manner to generate the final output. Experimental results on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches. Additional evaluations on in-the-wild videos further validate its generalizability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/iCityLab/PoseGRAF.</p></details> |  |

However, recent progress on multi-order game-theoretic interaction within deep neural networks (DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where the expressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increased kernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modern ConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning in pure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs. MogaNet encapsulates conceptually simple yet effective convolutions and gated aggregation into a compact module, where discriminative features are efficiently gathered and contextualized adaptively. MogaNet exhibits great scalability, impressive efficiency of parameters, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ViTs and ConvNets on ImageNet and various downstream vision benchmarks, including COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, 2D&3D human pose estimation, and video prediction. Notably, MogaNet hits 80.0% and 87.8% accuracy with 5.2M and 181M parameters on ImageNet-1K, outperforming ParC-Net and ConvNeXt-L, while saving 59% FLOPs and 17M parameters, respectively.

Accurate and efficient solutions are required for several real-world applications including animation, human-robot interaction, surveillance, and sports. However, challenges such as occlusions, 2D pose mismatches, random camera perspectives, and limited 3D labelled data have been hampering the models' performance and limiting their deployment in real-world scenarios. The higher availability of cameras has led researchers to explore multi-view solutions to take advantage of the different perspectives to reconstruct the pose. Most existing reviews have mainly focused on monocular 3D human pose estimation, so a comprehensive survey on multi-view approaches has been missing since 2012. According to the reviewed articles, the majority of the existing methods are fully-supervised approaches based on geometric constraints, which are often limited by 2D pose mismatches. To mitigate this, researchers have proposed incorporating temporal consistency or depth information. Alternatively, working directly with 3D features has been shown to completely overcome this issue, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity. Additionally, models with lower levels of supervision have been identified to help address challenges such as annotated data scarcity and generalisation to new setups. Therefore, no method currently addresses all challenges associated with 3D pose reconstruction, and a trade-off between complexity and performance exists. Further research is needed to develop approaches capable of quickly inferring a highly accurate 3D pose with bearable computation cost. Techniques such as active learning, low-supervision methods, temporal consistency, view selection, depth information estimation, and multi-modal approaches are strategies to consider when developing a new method for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 tables, 6 figures, accepted at Image and Vision Computing (IMAVIS)</p></details> |

However, accurate human joint estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda) Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation, window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error. This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose, with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, this process relies on human demonstrations captured through pose estimation or motion capture systems. In this paper, we explore a text-driven approach to mapping human motion to humanoids. To address the inherent discrepancies between the generated motion representations and the kinematic constraints of humanoid robots, we propose an angle signal network based on norm-position and rotation loss (NPR Loss). It generates joint angles, which serve as inputs to a reinforcement learning-based whole-body joint motion control policy. The policy ensures tracking of the generated motions while maintaining the robot's stability during execution. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, successfully transferring text-driven human motion to a real humanoid robot NAO.</p></details> |  |

In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.</p></details> |  |

Our work builds upon state-of-the-art advances in the area of human pose estimation, graph-attention neural networks, and transformer interpretablity. The downstream task is to assist rehabilitation by providing informative feedback to users while they are performing prescribed exercises. We utilize a contrastive learning strategy during training. Given a tuple of correctly and incorrectly executed exercises, our model is able to identify and highlight those joints that are involved in an incorrect movement and thus require the user's attention. We collected an in-house dataset, ExeCheck, with paired recordings of both correct and incorrect execution of exercises. In our experiments, we tested our method on this dataset as well as the UI-PRMD dataset and found ExeCheck outperformed the baseline method using pairwise sequence alignment in identifying joints of physical relevance in rehabilitation exercises.</p></details> |  |

Usually, action coordination is represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA) module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

In 3D HPE, occlusions, where parts of the body are not visible in the image, pose a significant challenge for accurate pose reconstruction. This paper presents a benchmark on the robustness of 3D HPE models under realistic occlusion conditions, involving combinations of occluded keypoints commonly observed in real-world scenarios. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D HPE models, spanning convolutional, transformer-based, graph-based, and diffusion-based architectures, using the BlendMimic3D dataset, a synthetic dataset with ground-truth 2D/3D annotations and occlusion labels. All models were originally trained on Human3.6M and tested here without retraining to assess their generalization. We introduce a protocol that simulates occlusion by adding noise into 2D keypoints based on real detector behavior, and conduct both global and per-joint sensitivity analyses. Our findings reveal that all models exhibit notable performance degradation under occlusion, with diffusion-based models underperforming despite their stochastic nature. Additionally, a per-joint occlusion analysis identifies consistent vulnerability in distal joints (e.g., wrists, feet) across models. Overall, this work highlights critical limitations of current 3D HPE models in handling occlusions, and provides insights for improving real-world robustness.</p></details> |  |

Human pose estimation methods take advantage of computer vision advances in order to track human body movements in real life applications. This comes from videos which are recorded through available devices. These para-digms provide potential to make human movement measurement more accessible to users. The consumers of pose estimation movements believe that human poses content tend to supplement available videos. This has increased pose estimation software usage to estimate human poses. In order to address this problem, we develop hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method to improve human health. This proposed hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method aims to detect multi-person poses using modified group pose estimation and modified real time pose estimation. This ensemble allows fusion of performance of stated methods in real time. The input poses from images are fed into individual meth-ods. The pose transformation method helps to identify relevant features for en-semble to perform training effectively. After this, customized pre-trained hybrid ensemble is trained on public benchmarked datasets which is being evaluated through test datasets. The effectiveness and viability of proposed method is estab-lished based on comparative analysis of group pose estimation methods and ex-periments conducted on benchmarked datasets. It provides best optimized results in real-time pose estimation. It makes pose estimation method more robust to oc-clusion and improves dense regression accuracy. These results have affirmed po-tential application of this method in several real-time situations with improvement in human health life span</p></details> |  |

For the task of test-time adaptation, the misalignment manifests as overly smoothed and unguided predictions. The smoothing settles predictions towards some average pose. Furthermore, when there are occlusions or truncations, the adaptation becomes fully unguided. To this end, we pioneer the integration of a semantics-aware motion prior for the test-time adaptation of 3D pose estimation. We leverage video understanding and a well-structured motion-text space to adapt the model motion prediction to adhere to video semantics during test time. Additionally, we incorporate a missing 2D pose completion based on the motion-text similarity. The pose completion strengthens the motion prior's guidance for occlusions and truncations. Our method significantly improves state-of-the-art 3D human pose estimation TTA techniques, with more than 12% decrease in PA-MPJPE on 3DPW and 3DHP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we introduce a novel task of human pose estimation using a front-facing event-based camera mounted on the head and propose D-EventEgo, the first framework for this task. The proposed method first estimates the head poses, and then these are used as conditions to generate body poses. However, when estimating head poses, the presence of dynamic objects mixed with background events may reduce head pose estimation accuracy.

Additionally, pose sequences often contain significant redundancy between frames. However, recent methods typically fail to improve model capacity while effectively eliminating sequence redundancy. In this work, we introduce the Spectral Compression Transformer (SCT) to reduce sequence length and accelerate computation. The SCT encoder treats hidden features between blocks as Temporal Feature Signals (TFS) and applies the Discrete Cosine Transform, a Fourier transform-based technique, to determine the spectral components to be retained. By filtering out certain high-frequency noise components, SCT compresses the sequence length and reduces redundancy. To further enrich the input sequence with prior structural information, we propose the Line Pose Graph (LPG) based on line graph theory. The LPG generates skeletal position information that complements the input 2D joint positions, thereby improving the model's performance. Finally, we design a dual-stream network architecture to effectively model spatial joint relationships and the compressed motion trajectory within the pose sequence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency. For example, on the Human3.6M dataset, our method achieves an MPJPE of 37.7mm while maintaining a low computational cost. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on each module to assess its effectiveness. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches lack mechanisms to incorporate auxiliary "side information" that could enhance reconstruction accuracy in such challenging scenarios. Furthermore, the most accurate methods rely on cropped person detections and cannot exploit scene context while methods that process the whole image often fail to detect people and are less accurate than methods that use crops. While recent language-based methods explore HPS reasoning through large language or vision-language models, their metric accuracy is well below the state of the art. In contrast, we present PromptHMR, a transformer-based promptable method that reformulates HPS estimation through spatial and semantic prompts. Our method processes full images to maintain scene context and accepts multiple input modalities: spatial prompts like bounding boxes and masks, and semantic prompts like language descriptions or interaction labels. PromptHMR demonstrates robust performance across challenging scenarios: estimating people from bounding boxes as small as faces in crowded scenes, improving body shape estimation through language descriptions, modeling person-person interactions, and producing temporally coherent motions in videos. Experiments on benchmarks show that PromptHMR achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering flexible prompt-based control over the HPS estimation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

In traditional domains, \eg regression and classification, MDT typically relies on dataset merging or multi-head supervision. However, the diversity of skeleton types and limited cross-dataset supervision complicate integration in pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce PoseBH, a new MDT framework that tackles keypoint heterogeneity and limited supervision through two key techniques. First, we propose nonparametric keypoint prototypes that learn within a unified embedding space, enabling seamless integration across skeleton types. Second, we develop a cross-type self-supervision mechanism that aligns keypoint predictions with keypoint embedding prototypes, providing supervision without relying on teacher-student models or additional augmentations. PoseBH substantially improves generalization across whole-body and animal pose datasets, including COCO-WholeBody, AP-10K, and APT-36K, while preserving performance on standard human pose benchmarks (COCO, MPII, and AIC). Furthermore, our learned keypoint embeddings transfer effectively to hand shape estimation (InterHand2.6M) and human body shape estimation (3DPW).

| **[Ev4DGS: Novel-view Rendering of Non-Rigid Objects from Monocular Event Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11717v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only. This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS, i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images) from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/Ev4DGS/.</p></details> |  |

While reinforcement learning (RL) policies trained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real transfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise dynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter estimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution, Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23% in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion for hammer pushing. Ablation studies indicate that the combination of VLM and interaction information is essential for success. Project website: https://phys2real.github.io/ .</p></details> |  |
| **[VA-GS: Enhancing the Geometric Representation of Gaussian Splatting via View Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11473v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment. In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

| **[MaterialRefGS: Reflective Gaussian Splatting with Multi-view Consistent Material Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11387v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering (PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling, resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end, we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with 2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel views synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

| **[LiDAR-GS:Real-time LiDAR Re-Simulation using Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05111v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LiDAR-GS, a Gaussian Splatting (GS) method for real-time, high-fidelity re-simulation of LiDAR scans in public urban road scenes. Recent GS methods proposed for cameras have achieved significant advancements in real-time rendering beyond Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, applying GS representation to LiDAR, an active 3D sensor type, poses several challenges that must be addressed to preserve high accuracy and unique characteristics. Specifically, LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam splatting, using range-view representation for precise surface splatting by projecting lasers onto micro cross-sections, effectively eliminating artifacts associated with local affine approximations. Furthermore, LiDAR-GS leverages Neural Gaussian Representation, which further integrate view-dependent clues, to represent key LiDAR properties that are influenced by the incident direction and external factors. Combining these practices with some essential adaptations, e.g., dynamic instances decomposition, LiDAR-GS succeeds in simultaneously re-simulating depth, intensity, and ray-drop channels, achieving state-of-the-art results in both rendering frame rate and quality on publically available large scene datasets when compared with the methods using explicit mesh or implicit NeRF. Our source code is publicly available at https://www.github.com/cqf7419/LiDAR-GS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Gaussian Splatting from Defocused and Motion-blurred Monocular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10691v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction. In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Fidelity Simulated Data Generation for Real-World Zero-Shot Robotic Manipulation Learning with Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10637v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalability of robotic learning is fundamentally bottlenecked by the significant cost and labor of real-world data collection. While simulated data offers a scalable alternative, it often fails to generalize to the real world due to significant gaps in visual appearance, physical properties, and object interactions. To address this, we propose RoboSimGS, a novel Real2Sim2Real framework that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable, high-fidelity, and physically interactive simulation environments for robotic manipulation. Our approach reconstructs scenes using a hybrid representation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) captures the photorealistic appearance of the environment, while mesh primitives for interactive objects ensure accurate physics simulation. Crucially, we pioneer the use of a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of physically plausible, articulated assets. The MLLM analyzes visual data to infer not only physical properties (e.g., density, stiffness) but also complex kinematic structures (e.g., hinges, sliding rails) of objects. We demonstrate that policies trained entirely on data generated by RoboSimGS achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks. Furthermore, data from RoboSimGS significantly enhances the performance and generalization capabilities of SOTA methods. Our results validate RoboSimGS as a powerful and scalable solution for bridging the sim-to-real gap.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, we present a extra-large fine-grained dataset with 10 billion points composed of 41,006 drone-captured high-resolution aerial images, covering 20 diverse and culturally significant scenes from worldwide locations such as Cambridge Uni main buildings, the Pyramids, and the Forbidden City Palace. Compared to existing datasets, ours offers significantly larger scale and higher detail, uniquely suited for fine-grained 3D applications. Each scene contains an accurate spatial layout and comprehensive structural information, supporting detailed 3D reconstruction tasks. By reconstructing environments using these detailed images, our dataset supports multiple applications, including outputs in the widely adopted COLMAP format, establishing a novel benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art large-scale Gaussian Splatting methods.The dataset's flexibility encourages innovations and supports model plug-ins, paving the way for future 3D breakthroughs. All datasets and code will be open-sourced for community use.</p></details> |  |
| **[FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 2min](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02691v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However, most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU, Replica, and BlendedMVS datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient 3D Gaussian Human Avatar Compression: A Prior-Guided Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10492v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an efficient 3D avatar coding framework that leverages compact human priors and canonical-to-target transformation to enable high-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates. The framework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated splatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar appearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to capture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations. This decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy, enabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the sequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters, consisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal bit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming canonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting compression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream multi-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive multimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Baking Gaussian Splatting into Diffusion Denoiser for Fast and Scalable Single-stage Image-to-3D Generation and Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14384v5)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing feedforward image-to-3D methods mainly rely on 2D multi-view diffusion models that cannot guarantee 3D consistency. These methods easily collapse when changing the prompt view direction and mainly handle object-centric cases. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage 3D diffusion model, DiffusionGS, for object generation and scene reconstruction from a single view. DiffusionGS directly outputs 3D Gaussian point clouds at each timestep to enforce view consistency and allow the model to generate robustly given prompt views of any directions, beyond object-centric inputs. Plus, to improve the capability and generality of DiffusionGS, we scale up 3D training data by developing a scene-object mixed training strategy. Experiments show that DiffusionGS yields improvements of 2.20 dB/23.25 and 1.34 dB/19.16 in PSNR/FID for objects and scenes than the state-of-the-art methods, without depth estimator. Plus, our method enjoys over 5$\times$ faster speed ($\sim$6s on an A100 GPU). Our Project page at https://caiyuanhao1998.github.io/project/DiffusionGS/ shows the video and interactive results.

| **[Opacity-Gradient Driven Density Control for Compact and Efficient Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10257v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Color3D: Controllable and Consistent 3D Colorization with Personalized Colorizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10152v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view, enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich renderings with precise user control.

| **[TC-GS: A Faster Gaussian Splatting Module Utilizing Tensor Cores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24796v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) renders pixels by rasterizing Gaussian primitives, where conditional alpha-blending dominates the computational cost in the rendering pipeline. This paper proposes TC-GS, an algorithm-independent universal module that expands the applicability of Tensor Core (TCU) for 3DGS, leading to substantial speedups and seamless integration into existing 3DGS optimization frameworks. The key innovation lies in mapping alpha computation to matrix multiplication, fully utilizing otherwise idle TCUs in existing 3DGS implementations. TC-GS provides plug-and-play acceleration for existing top-tier acceleration algorithms and integrates seamlessly with rendering pipeline designs, such as Gaussian compression and redundancy elimination algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local coordinate transformation to mitigate rounding errors from quadratic terms of pixel coordinates caused by Tensor Core half-precision computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains rendering quality while providing an additional 2.18x speedup over existing Gaussian acceleration algorithms, thereby achieving a total acceleration of up to 5.6x.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Gesplat: Robust Pose-Free 3D Reconstruction via Geometry-Guided Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10097v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[P-4DGS: Predictive 4D Gaussian Splatting with 90$\times$ Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10030v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance, especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this, we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to \textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and real-world scenes, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLoD-GS: Continuous Level-of-Detail via 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09997v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels (DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm: Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity. This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of performance targets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Powered Code Analysis and Optimization for Gaussian Splatting Kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25626v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a transformative technique with profound implications on novel view synthesis and real-time rendering. Given its importance, there have been many attempts to improve its performance. However, with the increasing complexity of GPU architectures and the vast search space of performance-tuning parameters, it is a challenging task. Although manual optimizations have achieved remarkable speedups, they require domain expertise and the optimization process can be highly time consuming and error prone. In this paper, we propose to exploit large language models (LLMs) to analyze and optimize Gaussian splatting kernels. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use LLMs to optimize highly specialized real-world GPU kernels. We reveal the intricacies of using LLMs for code optimization and analyze the code optimization techniques from the LLMs. We also propose ways to collaborate with LLMs to further leverage their capabilities. For the original 3DGS code on the MipNeRF360 datasets, LLMs achieve significant speedups, 19% with Deepseek and 24% with GPT-5, demonstrating the different capabilities of different LLMs. By feeding additional information from performance profilers, the performance improvement from LLM-optimized code is enhanced to up to 42% and 38% on average. In comparison, our best-effort manually optimized version can achieve a performance improvement up to 48% and 39% on average, showing that there are still optimizations beyond the capabilities of current LLMs. On the other hand, even upon a newly proposed 3DGS framework with algorithmic optimizations, Seele, LLMs can still further enhance its performance by 6%, showing that there are optimization opportunities missed by domain experts. This highlights the potential of collaboration between domain experts and LLMs.</p></details> | Updated Figure 12 |
| **[VG-Mapping: Variation-Aware 3D Gaussians for Online Semi-static Scene Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09962v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining an up-to-date map that accurately reflects recent changes in the environment is crucial, especially for robots that repeatedly traverse the same space. Failing to promptly update the changed regions can degrade map quality, resulting in poor localization, inefficient operations, and even lost robots. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently seen widespread adoption in online map reconstruction due to its dense, differentiable, and photorealistic properties, yet accurately and efficiently updating the regions of change remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose VG-Mapping, a novel online 3DGS-based mapping system tailored for such semi-static scenes. Our approach introduces a hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with a TSDF-based voxel map to efficiently identify changed regions in a scene, along with a variation-aware density control strategy that inserts or deletes Gaussian primitives in regions undergoing change. Furthermore, to address the absence of public benchmarks for this task, we construct a RGB-D dataset comprising both synthetic and real-world semi-static environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves the rendering quality and map update efficiency in semi-static scenes.

| **[LTGS: Long-Term Gaussian Scene Chronology From Sparse View Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09881v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures. However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations, significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines while enabling fast and light-weight updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Scenes: Pose-Free Sparse-View Scene Reconstruction using Depth-Enhanced Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15966v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce a generative approach for pose-free (without camera parameters) reconstruction of 360 scenes from a sparse set of 2D images. Pose-free scene reconstruction from incomplete, pose-free observations is usually regularized with depth estimation or 3D foundational priors. While recent advances have enabled sparse-view reconstruction of large complex scenes (with high degree of foreground and background detail) with known camera poses using view-conditioned generative priors, these methods cannot be directly adapted for the pose-free setting when ground-truth poses are not available during evaluation. To address this, we propose an image-to-image generative model designed to inpaint missing details and remove artifacts in novel view renders and depth maps of a 3D scene. We introduce context and geometry conditioning using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation layers as a lightweight alternative to cross-attention and also propose a novel confidence measure for 3D Gaussian splat representations to allow for better detection of these artifacts. By progressively integrating these novel views in a Gaussian-SLAM-inspired process, we achieve a multi-view-consistent 3D representation. Evaluations on the MipNeRF360 and DL3DV-10K benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pose-free techniques and performs competitively with state-of-the-art posed (precomputed camera parameters are given) reconstruction methods in complex 360 scenes.

| **[Vision Language Models: A Survey of 26K Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09586v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across 26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2) steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs, parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones; contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues and years.</p></details> | <details><summary>VLM/L...</summary><p>VLM/LLM Learning Notes</p></details> |

Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however, extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING (FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications - including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing - show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster convergence.

| **[Two-Stage Gaussian Splatting Optimization for Outdoor Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09489v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Outdoor scene reconstruction remains challenging due to the stark contrast between well-textured, nearby regions and distant backgrounds dominated by low detail, uneven illumination, and sky effects. We introduce a two-stage Gaussian Splatting framework that explicitly separates and optimizes these regions, yielding higher-fidelity novel view synthesis. In stage one, background primitives are initialized within a spherical shell and optimized using a loss that combines a background-only photometric term with two geometric regularizers: one constraining Gaussians to remain inside the shell, and another aligning them with local tangential planes. In stage two, foreground Gaussians are initialized from a Structure-from-Motion reconstruction, added and refined using the standard rendering loss, while the background set remains fixed but contributes to the final image formation. Experiments on diverse outdoor datasets show that our method reduces background artifacts and improves perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the explicit background separation enables automatic, object-free environment map estimation, opening new possibilities for photorealistic outdoor rendering and mixed-reality applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visibility-Aware Densification for 3D Gaussian Splatting in Dynamic Urban Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09364v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically, achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReSplat: Learning Recurrent Gaussian Splats](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08575v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times 256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed.

However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS, comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality and robustness under sparse view conditions.

| **[Splat the Net: Radiance Fields with Splattable Neural Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08491v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power. Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$ fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or adaptation frameworks.

While state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods excel at synthesizing photorealistic novel views through rasterization-based rendering, their reliance on sparse, explicit primitives severely limits their ability to recover watertight and topologically consistent 3D surfaces.We introduce MonoGSDF, a novel method that couples Gaussian-based primitives with a neural Signed Distance Field (SDF) for high-quality reconstruction. During training, the SDF guides Gaussians' spatial distribution, while at inference, Gaussians serve as priors to reconstruct surfaces, eliminating the need for memory-intensive Marching Cubes. To handle arbitrary-scale scenes, we propose a scaling strategy for robust generalization. A multi-resolution training scheme further refines details and monocular geometric cues from off-the-shelf estimators enhance reconstruction quality. Experiments on real-world datasets show MonoGSDF outperforms prior methods while maintaining efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Manual annotation is costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two 3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing. Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VCIP 2025 (International Conference on Visual Communications and Image Processing 2025)</p></details> |
| **[CVD-STORM: Cross-View Video Diffusion with Spatial-Temporal Reconstruction Model for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07944v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrismGS: Physically-Grounded Anti-Aliasing for High-Fidelity Large-Scale 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07830v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing ``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around 1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and robustness under demanding 4K rendering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Neural Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04597v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate LiDAR-camera calibration is crucial for multi-sensor systems. However, traditional methods often rely on physical targets, which are impractical for real-world deployment. Moreover, even carefully calibrated extrinsics can degrade over time due to sensor drift or external disturbances, necessitating periodic recalibration. To address these challenges, we present a Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration (TLC-Calib) that jointly optimizes sensor poses with a neural Gaussian-based scene representation. Reliable LiDAR points are frozen as anchor Gaussians to preserve global structure, while auxiliary Gaussians prevent local overfitting under noisy initialization. Our fully differentiable pipeline with photometric and geometric regularization achieves robust and generalizable calibration, consistently outperforming existing targetless methods on KITTI-360, Waymo, and FAST-LIVO2, and surpassing even the provided calibrations in rendering quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zang09.github.io/tlc-calib-site</p></details> |
| **[DEGS: Deformable Event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting from RGB and Event Stream](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07752v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively, the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS with the help of event data.</p></details> | Accepted by TVCG |
| **[ComGS: Efficient 3D Object-Scene Composition via Surface Octahedral Probes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07729v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360 degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for editing.

| **[RTGS: Real-Time 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM via Multi-Level Redundancy Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06644v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems can largely benefit from 3DGS's state-of-the-art rendering efficiency and accuracy, but have not yet been adopted in resource-constrained edge devices due to insufficient speed. Addressing this, we identify notable redundancies across the SLAM pipeline for acceleration. While conceptually straightforward, practical approaches are required to minimize the overhead associated with identifying and eliminating these redundancies. In response, we propose RTGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that comprehensively reduces the redundancies for real-time 3DGS-SLAM on edge. To minimize the overhead, RTGS fully leverages the characteristics of the 3DGS-SLAM pipeline. On the algorithm side, we introduce (1) an adaptive Gaussian pruning step to remove the redundant Gaussians by reusing gradients computed during backpropagation; and (2) a dynamic downsampling technique that directly reuses the keyframe identification and alpha computing steps to eliminate redundant pixels. On the hardware side, we propose (1) a subtile-level streaming strategy and a pixel-level pairwise scheduling strategy that mitigates workload imbalance via a Workload Scheduling Unit (WSU) guided by previous iteration information; (2) a Rendering and Backpropagation (R&B) Buffer that accelerates the rendering backpropagation by reusing intermediate data computed during rendering; and (3) a Gradient Merging Unit (GMU) to reduce intensive memory accesses caused by atomic operations while enabling pipelined aggregation. Integrated into an edge GPU, RTGS achieves real-time performance (>= 30 FPS) on four datasets and three algorithms, with up to 82.5x energy efficiency over the baseline and negligible quality loss.

Our pipeline estimates editable material properties and environment illumination while employing a directional residual pass that captures leftover view-dependent effects for further refining novel view synthesis. In contrast to per-Gaussian shading with shortest-axis normals and normal residuals, which tends to result in more noisy geometry and specular appearance, a pixel-deferred surfel formulation with specular residuals yields sharper highlights, cleaner materials, and improved editability. We evaluate our approach on rendering and reconstruction quality on three popular datasets featuring glossy objects, and also demonstrate high-quality relighting and material editing.</p></details> |  |

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers real-time, high-fidelity rendering, its performance drastically deteriorates under sparse inputs, plagued by floating artifacts and structural failures. To address these challenges, we introduce HBSplat, a unified framework that elevates 3DGS by seamlessly integrating robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region completion. Our core contributions are threefold: a Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that ensures multi-view consistency by leveraging dense matching priors and integrating reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method that enforces substantially stronger constraints by creating high-fidelity virtual views through bidirectional depth-image warping and multi-view fusion; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that recovers occluded areas using a depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model. Extensive evaluations on LLFF, Blender, and DTU benchmarks validate that HBSplat sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS, while maintaining real-time inference.

However, due to the complex geometric shapes of objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task. Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper, we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.</p></details> |  |

However, the intricate electromagnetic scattering mechanisms inherent to SAR imaging pose significant reconstruction challenges. Inspired by the remarkable success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) in optical domain reconstruction, this paper presents a novel SAR Differentiable Gaussian Splatting Rasterizer (SDGR) specifically designed for SAR target reconstruction. Our approach combines Gaussian splatting with the Mapping and Projection Algorithm to compute scattering intensities of Gaussian primitives and generate simulated SAR images through SDGR. Subsequently, the loss function between the rendered image and the ground truth image is computed to optimize the Gaussian primitive parameters representing the scene, while a custom CUDA gradient flow is employed to replace automatic differentiation for accelerated gradient computation. Through experiments involving the rendering of simplified architectural targets and SAR images of multiple vehicle targets, we validate the imaging rationality of SDGR on simulated SAR imagery. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our method for target reconstruction is demonstrated on both simulated and real-world datasets containing multiple vehicle targets, with quantitative evaluations conducted to assess its reconstruction performance. Experimental results indicate that our approach can effectively reconstruct the geometric structures and scattering properties of targets, thereby providing a novel solution for 3D reconstruction in the field of SAR imaging.</p></details> |  |

LangSplat employs Gaussian Splatting to embed 2D CLIP language features into 3D, significantly enhancing speed and learning a precise 3D language field with SAM semantics. Such advancements in 3D language fields are crucial for applications that require language interaction within complex scenes. However, LangSplat does not yet achieve real-time inference performance (8.2 FPS), even with advanced A100 GPUs, severely limiting its broader application. In this paper, we first conduct a detailed time analysis of LangSplat, identifying the heavyweight decoder as the primary speed bottleneck. Our solution, LangSplatV2 assumes that each Gaussian acts as a sparse code within a global dictionary, leading to the learning of a 3D sparse coefficient field that entirely eliminates the need for a heavyweight decoder. By leveraging this sparsity, we further propose an efficient sparse coefficient splatting method with CUDA optimization, rendering high-dimensional feature maps at high quality while incurring only the time cost of splatting an ultra-low-dimensional feature.

Existing methods typically rely on heuristic strategies to handle the low-quality training data, which often struggle to produce stable and consistent reconstructions, frequently resulting in visual artifacts. In this work, we propose \modelname{}, a novel framework that leverages the stochastic nature of these artifacts: they tend to vary across different training runs due to minor randomness. Specifically, our method trains two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models in parallel, enforcing a consistency constraint that encourages convergence on reliable scene geometry while suppressing inconsistent artifacts. To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes due to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that applies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a self-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the two models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency of model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy, which replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to preserve divergence. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches while achieving high efficiency.

In this work, we present a unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExGS: Extreme 3D Gaussian Compression with Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24758v4)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering quality. We introduce ExGS, a novel feed-forward framework that unifies Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) with GaussPainter for Extreme 3DGS compression. UGC performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas GaussPainter leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can even achieve over 100X compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and high-quality neural rendering.

| **[ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering. ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining. Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss +7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering speed nearly doubles.</p></details> |  |

Unlike mainstream implicit neural models, 3D GS uses millions of learnable 3D Gaussians for an explicit scene representation. Paired with a differentiable rendering algorithm, this approach achieves real-time rendering and unprecedented editability, making it a potential game-changer for 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research.

| **[TimeFormer: Capturing Temporal Relationships of Deformable 3D Gaussians for Robust Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11941v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Recent methods extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via additional deformation fields and apply explicit constraints like motion flow to guide the deformation. However, they learn motion changes from individual timestamps independently, making it challenging to reconstruct complex scenes, particularly when dealing with violent movement, extreme-shaped geometries, or reflective surfaces. To address the above issue, we design a plug-and-play module called TimeFormer to enable existing deformable 3D Gaussians reconstruction methods with the ability to implicitly model motion patterns from a learning perspective. Specifically, TimeFormer includes a Cross-Temporal Transformer Encoder, which adaptively learns the temporal relationships of deformable 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we propose a two-stream optimization strategy that transfers the motion knowledge learned from TimeFormer to the base stream during the training phase. This allows us to remove TimeFormer during inference, thereby preserving the original rendering speed. Extensive experiments in the multi-view and monocular dynamic scenes validate qualitative and quantitative improvement brought by TimeFormer.

Further, we develop a GPU-accelerated motion planning algorithm that can exploit the Gaussian map for real-time navigation. The Gaussian map constructed onboard the robot is optimized for both photometric and geometric quality while enabling real-time situational awareness for autonomy. We show through viewpoint selection experiments that our method yields comparable Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and similar reconstruction error to state-of-the-art approaches, while being orders of magnitude faster to compute. In closed-loop physics-based simulation and real-world experiments, our algorithm achieves better map quality (at least 0.8dB higher PSNR and more than 16% higher geometric reconstruction accuracy) than maps constructed by a state-of-the-art method, enabling semantic segmentation using off-the-shelf open-set models.

| **[Optimized Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03857v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions. However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations, further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new possibilities for a wide range of applications.

| **[OracleGS: Grounding Generative Priors for Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23258v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our "propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the 3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss. Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page available at: https://atakan-topaloglu.github.io/oraclegs/</p></details> |
| **[Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09040v4)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful tool for high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic scenes. However, existing methods primarily rely on implicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks or per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the reconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application in robotics. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MBGS), a novel framework that uses motion graphs as an explicit and sparse motion representation. The motion of a graph's links is propagated to individual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions that determine the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that MBGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the highly challenging iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF. We demonstrate the application potential of our method in animating novel object poses, synthesizing real robot demonstrations, and predicting robot actions through visual planning.

However, it remains challenging due to complex propagation interactions, including reflection, diffraction, and scattering. State-of-the-art neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods achieve high-fidelity RF data synthesis but are limited by long training times and high inference latency. We introduce GSRF, a framework that extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from the optical domain to the RF domain, enabling efficient RF data synthesis. GSRF realizes this adaptation through three key innovations: First, it introduces complex-valued 3D Gaussians with a hybrid Fourier-Legendre basis to model directional and phase-dependent radiance. Second, it employs orthographic splatting for efficient ray-Gaussian intersection identification. Third, it incorporates a complex-valued ray tracing algorithm, executed on RF-customized CUDA kernels and grounded in wavefront propagation principles, to synthesize RF data in real time. Evaluated across various RF technologies, GSRF preserves high-fidelity RF data synthesis while achieving significant improvements in training efficiency, shorter training time, and reduced inference latency.</p></details> |  |

SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label 872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests, SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task completion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/sixnor/SketchPlan</p></details> |

While prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and performance of pretrained semantic features.</p></details> |  |

Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as a promising approach for accurate 3D reconstruction.

Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission overhead by 36%.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |

Recent research has highlighted the potential of data-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots. However, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality or excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture is also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and remains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level method is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D) Gaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster the 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are controlled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural network. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data pairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without depth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles, we can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology, kinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images from different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the established model can be exploited to perform downstream tasks such as motion planning and inverse kinematics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IJRR.

While recent sparse control methods alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity. Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets, replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

We present MCGS-SLAM, the first purely RGB-based multi-camera SLAM system built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike prior methods relying on sparse maps or inertial data, MCGS-SLAM fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple viewpoints into a unified, continuously optimized Gaussian map. A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines poses and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale consistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank priors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at large scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that MCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic reconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide field of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view regions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation. These results highlight the promise of multi-camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM for high-fidelity mapping in robotics and autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art visual policies often overfit to a single track and their performance degrades when track geometry changes. We develop FalconGym 2.0, a photorealistic simulation framework built on Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with an Edit API that programmatically generates diverse static and dynamic tracks in milliseconds. Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual policy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its performance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with distinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generalization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100% success without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under gate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a quadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30 trials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to 48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction, unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy.

Controlled indoor environment enables year-round repeatable UAV experiment but imposes strict weight and maneuverability limits on the UAV, motivating our ultra-light FalconWing design. FalconWing couples a lightweight hardware stack (137g airframe with a 9g camera) and offboard computation with a software stack featuring a photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splat (GSplat) simulator for developing and evaluating vision-based controllers. We validate FalconWing on two challenging vision-based aerial case studies. In the leader-follower case study, our best vision-based controller, trained via imitation learning on GSplat-rendered data augmented with domain randomization, achieves 100% tracking success across 3 types of leader maneuvers over 30 trials and shows robustness to leader's appearance shifts in simulation. In the autonomous landing case study, our vision-based controller trained purely in simulation transfers zero-shot to real hardware, achieving an 80% success rate over ten landing trials.

Existing neural rendering approaches often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to existing Gaussian splatting methods.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches usually rely on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling. The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors 3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior 2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by 26.2%.

To address these issues, we propose 4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism, which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions. Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective 4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works, our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our code will be made available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

We propose ROI-GS, an object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining real-time performance.

Recent advances in radiance field methods, such as Gaussian splatting, enable photorealistic reconstruction but have so far been restricted to individual plants or controlled laboratory conditions. In this work, we introduce GreenhouseSplat, a framework and dataset for generating photorealistic greenhouse assets directly from inexpensive RGB images. The resulting assets are integrated into a ROS-based simulation with support for camera and LiDAR rendering, enabling tasks such as localization with fiducial markers. We provide a dataset of 82 cucumber plants across multiple row configurations and demonstrate its utility for robotics evaluation. GreenhouseSplat represents the first step toward greenhouse-scale radiance-field simulation and offers a foundation for future research in agricultural robotics.</p></details> |  |

However, scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i) partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPMAvatar: Learning 3D Gaussian Avatars with Accurate and Robust Physics-Based Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01619v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1) dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation generalizability.

In this work, we present Instant4D, a monocular reconstruction system that leverages native 4D representation to efficiently process casual video sequences within minutes, without calibrated cameras or depth sensors. Our method begins with geometric recovery through deep visual SLAM, followed by grid pruning to optimize scene representation. Our design significantly reduces redundancy while maintaining geometric integrity, cutting model size to under 10% of its original footprint. To handle temporal dynamics efficiently, we introduce a streamlined 4D Gaussian representation, achieving a 30x speed-up and reducing training time to within two minutes, while maintaining competitive performance across several benchmarks. Our method reconstruct a single video within 10 minutes on the Dycheck dataset or for a typical 200-frame video. We further apply our model to in-the-wild videos, showcasing its generalizability.

| **[Proxy-GS: Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting via Proxy Mesh](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24421v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering. To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles: first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training, avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset, Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Beta Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03312v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs. dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering while consistently outperforming existing methods across static, view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable universal primitive for radiance field rendering.

| **[HART: Human Aligned Reconstruction Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26621v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction. Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by 18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world settings. Code and models will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xiyichen.github.io/hart</p></details> |

Unlike existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods, which rely on time-conditioned deformation networks and are limited to interpolation within a fixed time window, ODE-GS eliminates timestamp dependency by modeling Gaussian parameter trajectories as continuous-time latent dynamics. Our approach first learns an interpolation model to generate accurate Gaussian trajectories within the observed window, then trains a Transformer encoder to aggregate past trajectories into a latent state evolved via a neural ODE. Finally, numerical integration produces smooth, physically plausible future Gaussian trajectories, enabling rendering at arbitrary future timestamps. On the D-NeRF, NVFi, and HyperNeRF benchmarks, ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation performance, improving metrics by 19.8% compared to leading baselines, demonstrating its ability to accurately represent and predict 3D scene dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Stylos synthesizes a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Novel View Synthesis in High Dynamic Range](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21853v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes, implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living. However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge, we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will be released.</p></details> |  |

GaussEdit leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global scene coherence and detailed local edits and a category-guided regularization technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique, ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the given prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that GaussEdit surpasses existing methods in editing accuracy, visual fidelity, and processing speed. By successfully embedding user-specified concepts into 3D scenes, GaussEdit is a powerful tool for detailed and user-driven 3D scene editing, offering significant improvements over traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

However, it often struggles to capture rich details and complete geometry. Our analysis reveals that the 3D-GS densification operation lacks adaptiveness and faces a dilemma between geometry coverage and detail recovery. To address this, we introduce a novel densification operation, residual split, which adds a downscaled Gaussian as a residual. Our approach is capable of adaptively retrieving details and complementing missing geometry. To further support this method, we propose a pipeline named ResGS. Specifically, we integrate a Gaussian image pyramid for progressive supervision and implement a selection scheme that prioritizes the densification of coarse Gaussians over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering quality. Consistent performance improvements can be achieved by applying our residual split on various 3D-GS variants, underscoring its versatility and potential for broader application in 3D-GS-based applications.</p></details> |  |

Our key insight is to exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery (undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally, fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty and valuable empirical insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[Image-Conditioned 3D Gaussian Splat Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15372v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks. This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating. Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaussianLens: Localized High-Resolution Reconstruction via On-Demand Gaussian Densification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25603v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions, preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to $1024\times1024$ resolution.</p></details> |  |

Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians, enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines, which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training. Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs.

However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward pass.

Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering, there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Existing 2D and 3D physical attacks, due to their focus on texture optimization, often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates complex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.

| **[PoI: A Filter to Extract Pixel of Interest from Novel View Synthesis for Scene Coordinate Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04843v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel View synthesis (NVS) techniques, notably Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), can augment camera pose estimation by extending training data with rendered images. However, the images rendered by these methods are often plagued by blurring, undermining their reliability as training data for camera pose estimation. This limitation is particularly critical for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which aim at pixel-level 3D coordinate estimation, because rendering artifacts directly lead to estimation inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-criteria filtering mechanism that dynamically identifies and discards suboptimal pixels during training. The dual-criteria filter evaluates two concurrent metrics: (1) real-time SCR reprojection error, and (2) gradient threshold, across the coordinate regression domain. In addition, for visual localization problems in sparse input scenarios, it will be even more necessary to use data generated by NVS to assist the localization task. We design a coarse-to-fine PoI variant using sparse input NVS to solve this problem. Experiments across indoor and outdoor benchmarks confirm our method's efficacy. It achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[OMeGa: Joint Optimization of Explicit Meshes and Gaussian Splats for Robust Scene-Level Surface Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24308v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis, and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh. OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Differentiable Light Transport with Gaussian Surfels via Adapted Radiosity for Efficient Relighting and Geometry Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18497v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives, propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known or unknown lighting conditions.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, its large model size requires efficient compression for storage and transmission. However, compression techniques, especially quantization-based methods, degrade the integrity of existing 3DGS watermarking methods, thus creating the need for a novel methodology that is robust against compression. To ensure reliable watermark detection under compression, we propose a compression-tolerant 3DGS watermarking method that preserves watermark integrity and rendering quality. Our approach utilizes an anchor-based 3DGS, embedding the watermark into anchor attributes, particularly the anchor feature, to enhance security and rendering quality. We also propose a quantization distortion layer that injects quantization noise during training, preserving the watermark after quantization-based compression. Moreover, we employ a frequency-aware anchor growing strategy that enhances rendering quality by effectively identifying Gaussians in high-frequency regions, and an HSV loss to mitigate color artifacts for further rendering quality improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method preserves the watermark even under compression and maintains high rendering quality.</p></details> | 33 pages, 19 figures |
| **[CrashSplat: 2D to 3D Vehicle Damage Segmentation in Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23947v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage. Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches impractical or impossible.

Our avatar enables facial attribute editing in a continuous and disentangled latent space to control each facial attribute, while preserving the individual's identity. To achieve this, our method begins by synthesizing large-scale synthetic 2D video datasets, where each video contains consistent changes in facial expression and viewpoint, along with variations in a specific facial attribute from the original input. We propose a novel pipeline to produce high-quality, photorealistic 2D videos with facial attribute editing. Leveraging this synthetic attribute dataset, we present a personalized avatar creation method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, learning a continuous and disentangled latent space for intuitive facial attribute manipulation. To enforce smooth transitions in this latent space, we introduce a latent space regularization technique by using interpolated 2D faces as supervision. Compared to previous approaches, we demonstrate that PERSE generates high-quality avatars with interpolated attributes while preserving the identity of the reference individual.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://hyunsoocha.github.io/perse/</p></details> |

NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals: photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual environments.</p></details> | 18 pages |

While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex, region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time, space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

In contrast to video/4D generation from only text or a single image, our interpolative task can leverage more precise motion control to better constrain the generation. Given two monocular RGB images representing the start and end states of an object in motion, our goal is to generate and reconstruct the motion in 4D, without making assumptions on the object category, motion type, length, or complexity. To handle such arbitrary and diverse motions, we utilize a foundational video interpolation model for motion prediction. However, large frame-to-frame motion gaps can lead to ambiguous interpretations. To this end, we employ a hierarchical approach to identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states while exhibiting significant motions, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each fragment, we construct a 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling their transformation into dynamic 3DGS through a deformation field. To improve temporal consistency and refine the 3D motion, we expand the self-attention of multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation regularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion segments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to align with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions. Through extensive qualitative and quantitive experiments as well as a user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and design choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH ASIA 2025; Project page at https://in-2-4d.github.io/</p></details> |

We show that this connection enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project link: https://point-prompting.github.io</p></details> |
| **[On Convolutions, Intrinsic Dimension, and Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20705v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models, and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support. For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers, adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions. Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025 (expert certification)</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Transformers with Representation Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11690v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty, propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; Project Page: https://rae-dit.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization for Memory-efficient RL of Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11683v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance. Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Capturing and annotating large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a practical and affordable solution.

| **[Diffusion-DFL: Decision-focused Diffusion Models for Stochastic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11590v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Low-Effort Training Data Generation for Urban Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11567v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation, object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance. Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for urban scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions. Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465 trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all baselines and ablations, suggesting that this is a promising approach to acquiring robotic scooping skills.

Unlike prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1) complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation), and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space, our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without relying on predefined instrument categories.

EqM discards the non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.</p></details> |  |

Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations} (MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail \textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).</p></details> |  |

To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Transient Instability and Patterns of Reactivity in Diffusive-Chemotaxis Soil Carbon Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08757v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study pattern formation in a chemotaxis model of bacteria and soil carbon dynamics as an example system where transient dynamics can give rise to pattern formation outside of Turing unstable regimes. We use a detailed analysis of the reactivity of the non-spatial and spatial dynamics, stability analyses, and numerical continuation to uncover detailed aspects of this system's pattern-forming potential. In addition to patterning in Turing unstable parameter regimes, reactivity of the spatial system can itself lead to a range of parameters where a spatially uniform state is asymptotically stable, but exhibits transient growth that can induce pattern formation. We show that this occurs in the bistable region of a subcritical Turing bifurcation. Intriguingly, such bistable regions appear in two spatial dimensions, but not in a one-dimensional domain, suggesting important interplays between geometry, transient growth, and the emergence of multistable patterns. We discuss the implications of our analysis for the bacterial soil organic carbon system, as well as for reaction-transport modeling more generally.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning with Generative Trajectory Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11499v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex, multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow, iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue, lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Error Propagation Mechanisms and Compensation Strategies for Quantized Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12094v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have transformed image synthesis by establishing unprecedented quality and creativity benchmarks. Nevertheless, their large-scale deployment faces challenges due to computationally intensive iterative denoising processes. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an effective pathway for accelerating sampling, the iterative nature of diffusion models causes stepwise quantization errors to accumulate progressively during generation, inevitably compromising output fidelity. To address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that mathematically formulates error propagation in Diffusion Models (DMs), deriving per-step quantization error propagation equations and establishing the first closed-form solution for cumulative error. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate that our compensation strategy effectively mitigates error propagation, significantly enhancing existing PTQ methods. Specifically, it achieves a 1.2 PSNR improvement over SVDQuant on SDXL W4A4, while incurring only an additional $<$ 0.5\% time overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs with Masked Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11462v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the significant benefits of our unified approach.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their contributions, enabling incremental of new representations. We evaluate our approach on simulated manipulation tasks in {RLBench}, as well as real-world tasks such as occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, and puzzle insertion, where it significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines on scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning. Our policy further demonstrates robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption. We further conduct perturbation-based importance analysis, which reveals adaptive shifts between modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures.

| **[ID-Booth: Identity-consistent Face Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07392v6)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. The source code for the ID-Booth framework is publicly available at https://github.com/dariant/ID-Booth.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) 2025, 14 pages</p></details> |
| **[Failure Prediction at Runtime for Generative Robot Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09459v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow matching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However, distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators, aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards more interpretable and safer generative robot policies.

| **[Uncertainty-Aware ControlNet: Bridging Domain Gaps with Synthetic Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11346v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution. This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene experiment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at ICCV Workshops 2025, "The 4th Workshop on What is Next in Multimodal Foundation Models?"

| **[DiffStyleTS: Diffusion Model for Style Transfer in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11335v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another. It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation, helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that disentangles a time series into content and style representations via convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.</p></details> |  |

We present Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results. (1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2) Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and 7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond knowledge-retrieval-centric designs.

Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers a $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared to the AR model (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with the latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still delivers a $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning the Structure of Connection Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11245v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining computationally efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unified and Lossless Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality. On GEOM-Drugs, it reduces FCD by 72.6\% over the previous best result, while achieving over 70\% relative average improvements in geometric fidelity.

Wang and Zhu (2023) showed that for the Wasserstein metric $\mathcal{W}_2$ and for $d\geq 5$, the convergence rate of $T^{-1/(d-2)}$ is attained by the occupation measure of the path $(X_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$ when $(X_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$ is a Langevin diffusion. We extend their result in several directions. First, we show that the rate of convergence holds for a large class of diffusion paths, whose generators are uniformly elliptic. Second, the regularity of the density $p$ of the stationary measure $\mu$ with respect to the volume measure of $\mathcal{M}$ can be leveraged to obtain faster estimators: when $p$ belongs to a Sobolev space of order $\ell\geq 2$, smoothing the occupation measure by convolution with a kernel yields an estimator whose rate of convergence is of order $T^{-(\ell+1)/(2\ell+d-2)}$. We further show that this rate is the minimax rate of estimation for this problem.</p></details> |  |

CSI prediction, which forecasts future CSI from historical observations, offers a promising solution. Recent deep learning approaches, including recurrent neural networks and Transformers, have achieved notable success but typically learn deterministic mappings, limiting their ability to capture the stochastic and multimodal nature of wireless channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for CSI prediction based on diffusion models, offering a flexible design that supports integration of diverse prediction schemes. We decompose the CSI prediction task into two components: a temporal encoder, which extracts channel dynamics, and a diffusion-based generator, which produces future CSI samples. We investigate two inference schemes-autoregressive and sequence-to-sequence- and explore multiple diffusion backbones, including U-Net and Transformer-based architectures. Furthermore, we examine a diffusion-based approach without an explicit temporal encoder and utilize the DDIM scheduling to reduce model complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our diffusion-based models significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |

Previous arts failed to address both of them, always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band, while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row. Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile, serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion models.

SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup).

In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6 featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization across settings.</p></details> |  |

To learn meaningful distributions over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically consistent 3D scene motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025, project page: https://jiahuilei.com/projects/momap/</p></details> |

However, their multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex multimodal tasks. In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies. Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of MLLMs in real world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete-Time Diffusion-Like Models for Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18470v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising, which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions. Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants. These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises. The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Alignment Guidance: On-Manifold Sampling in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11057v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models. However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism, `Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in generation quality across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 17 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |
| **[Latent Refinement Decoding: Enhancing Diffusion-Based Language Models by Refining Belief States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11052v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream, mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding (HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |

However, their deployment is often limited by significant inference latency, primarily due to the inherently sequential nature of the denoising process. While existing parallelization strategies attempt to accelerate inference by distributing computation across multiple devices, they typically incur high communication overhead, hindering deployment on commercial hardware. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{ParaStep}, a novel parallelization method based on a reuse-then-predict mechanism that parallelizes diffusion inference by exploiting similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike prior approaches that rely on layer-wise or stage-wise communication, ParaStep employs lightweight, step-wise communication, substantially reducing overhead. ParaStep achieves end-to-end speedups of up to \textbf{3.88}$\times$ on SVD, \textbf{2.43}$\times$ on CogVideoX-2b, and \textbf{6.56}$\times$ on AudioLDM2-large, while maintaining generation quality. These results highlight ParaStep as a scalable and communication-efficient solution for accelerating diffusion inference, particularly in bandwidth-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parareal in time and spectral in space fast L1 quasilinear subdiffusion solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11023v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the initial-boundary value problem for a quasilinear time-fractional diffusion equation, and develop a fully discrete solver combining the parareal algorithm in time with a L1 finite-difference approximation of the Caputo derivative and a spectral Galerkin discretization in space. Our main contribution is the first rigorous convergence proof for the parareal-L1 scheme in this nonlinear subdiffusive setting. By constructing suitable energy norms and exploiting the orthogonality of the spectral basis, we establish that the parareal iterations converge exactly to the fully serial L1-spectral solution in a finite number of steps, with rates independent of the fractional exponent. The spectral spatial discretization yields exponential accuracy in space, while the parareal structure induces a clock speedup proportional to the number of processors, making the overall method highly efficient. Numerical experiments for both subdiffusive and classical diffusion problems confirm our theoretical estimates and demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in computational time compared to the conventional sequential solver. We observe that the speedup of the parareal method increases linearly with the fine integrator degrees of freedom.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial and Temporal Boundaries in Difference-in-Differences: A Framework from Navier-Stokes Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11013v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity: within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay (PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s = 0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.</p></details> | 56 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Learning Diffusion Models with Flexible Representation Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08980v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.

While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot, inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion attributes according to target Laban tags.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA), an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and overall visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://nenhang.github.io/ContextGen/</p></details> |

However, current vision-language-action (VLA) frameworks primarily rely on static representations and limited temporal context, restricting agents to short-horizon, reactive behaviors and hindering robust generalization in dynamic embodied environments. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience theories of episodic memory, we propose, to our knowledge, one of the first formalized episodic world models in VLA, enabling embodied robots to accumulate, recall, and predict sequential experiences. As an instantiation of this concept, our unified TriVLA realizes the episodic world model through a triple-system architecture: integrating multimodal grounding from a pretrained VLM (System 2) and temporally rich dynamics perception from a video diffusion model (System 3). This enables the agent to accumulate and recall sequential experiences, interpret current contexts, and predict future environmental evolution. Guided by episodic representations that span both the past and anticipated future, the downstream policy (System 1) generates coherent, context-aware action sequences through flow-matching and cross-modal attention mechanisms. Experimental results show that TriVLA operates efficiently at approximately 36 Hz and consistently outperforms baseline models on standard benchmarks and challenging real-world manipulation tasks. It demonstrates strong long-horizon planning and open-ended intent understanding, showcasing the advantages of episodic world model-inspired reasoning for robust, generalizable robot intelligence.

However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work, we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views, PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free). Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors. Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems, including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |

As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. However, the widespread adoption and advancing capabilities of generative image editing tools have amplified malicious tampering risks, while simultaneously posing new challenges to passive tampering detection and watermark robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results demonstrate that TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tampering robustness and localization capability even under distortion, while preserving lossless generation quality and maintaining a watermark capacity of 256 bits.

| **[Towards Unsupervised Training of Matching-based Graph Edit Distance Solver via Preference-aware GAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01977v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a fundamental graph similarity metric widely used in various applications. However, computing GED is an NP-hard problem. Recent state-of-the-art hybrid GED solver has shown promising performance by formulating GED as a bipartite graph matching problem, then leveraging a generative diffusion model to predict node matching between two graphs, from which both the GED and its corresponding edit path can be extracted using a traditional algorithm. However, such methods typically rely heavily on ground-truth supervision, where the ground-truth node matchings are often costly to obtain in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose GEDRanker, a novel unsupervised GAN-based framework for GED computation. Specifically, GEDRanker consists of a matching-based GED solver and introduces an interpretable preference-aware discriminator. By leveraging preference signals over different node matchings derived from edit path lengths, the discriminator can guide the matching-based solver toward generating high-quality node matching without the need for ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our GEDRanker enables the matching-based GED solver to achieve near-optimal solution quality without any ground-truth supervision.</p></details> |  |

DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various conditioning inputs such as reference images, specific RGB colors, and textual descriptions.

However, flexible and localized style editing for scene text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and text preservation.</p></details> |  |

However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500, 18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.</p></details> |  |

The proposed coarsening approaches begin by constructing a partitioning of the computational domain into a set of balanced local subdomains, resulting in a standard type of domain decomposition. Given this initial decomposition, general coarsening techniques based on spectral clustering are applied within each subgraph in order to accurately identify the key microscopic features of a given system. The spectral clustering algorithm is based on local generalized eigen-decompositions applied to the signed graph Laplacian. The resulting coarse-fine splittings are combined with two variants of energy-minimizing strategies for constructing coarse bases for diffusion problems. The first is an unconstrained minimization formulation in which local harmonic extensions are applied column-wise to construct multi-vector preserving interpolation in each region, whereas the second approach is a variant of the constrained energy minimization formulations derived in the context of non-local multi-continua upscaling techniques. We apply the resulting upscaling algorithms to a variety of tests coming from the graph Laplacian, including diffusion in the perforated domain, channelized media, highly anisotropic settings, and discrete pore network models to demonstrate the potential and robustness of the proposed coarsening approaches. We show numerically and theoretically that the proposed approaches lead to accurate coarse-scale models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while slightly improving performance over the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://soroushmehraban.github.io/FastHMR/</p></details> |

Existing serving systems use fixed degree sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO attainment. In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines. We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2) adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and (3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.</p></details> |  |

Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models, essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint. In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance of discrete-state diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Layered Diffusion Brushes (LDB), a novel training-free framework that enables interactive, layer-based editing using standard diffusion models. LDB defines each "layer" as a self-contained set of parameters guiding the generative process, enabling independent, non-destructive, and fine-grained prompt-guided edits, even in overlapping regions. LDB leverages a unique intermediate latent caching approach to reduce each edit to only a few denoising steps, achieving 140~ms per edit on consumer GPUs. An editor implementing LDB, incorporating familiar layer concepts, was evaluated via user study and quantitative metrics. Results demonstrate LDB's superior speed alongside comparable or improved image quality, background preservation, and edit fidelity relative to state-of-the-art methods across various sequential image manipulation tasks. The findings highlight LDB's ability to significantly enhance creative workflows by providing an intuitive and efficient approach to diffusion-based image editing and its potential for expansion into related subdomains, such as video editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.00219</p></details> |

We introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE) denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance. In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator.

First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA) mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted 2025 EMNLP (MainConference)</p></details> |
| **[Structure Over Signal: A Globalized Approach to Multi-relational GNNs for Stock Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10775v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing. Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Sampler Stochasticity in Training Diffusion Models for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10767v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Stochastic Differential Equation Framework for Multi-Objective LLM Interactions: Dynamical Systems Analysis with Code Generation Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10739v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a general stochastic differential equation framework for modelling multiobjective optimization dynamics in iterative Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. Our framework captures the inherent stochasticity of LLM responses through explicit diffusion terms and reveals systematic interference patterns between competing objectives via an interference matrix formulation. We validate our theoretical framework using iterative code generation as a proof-of-concept application, analyzing 400 sessions across security, efficiency, and functionality objectives. Our results demonstrate strategy-dependent convergence behaviors with rates ranging from 0.33 to 1.29, and predictive accuracy achieving R2 = 0.74 for balanced approaches. This work proposes the feasibility of dynamical systems analysis for multi-objective LLM interactions, with code generation serving as an initial validation domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Peer-...</summary><p>Peer-reviewed and accepted to the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) DynaFront 2025 Workshop (https://sites.google.com/view/dynafrontneurips25)</p></details> |
| **[Local MAP Sampling for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07343v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on inverse scattering benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative Prompting for Creative Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10715v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead. Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines, offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond the constraints of textual descriptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://shelley-golan.github.io/VLM-Guided-Creative-Generation/</p></details> |
| **[State-Covering Trajectory Stitching for Diffusion Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00895v3)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[AdaViewPlanner: Adapting Video Diffusion Models for Viewpoint Planning in 4D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10670v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First, we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.</p></details> |  |

These structures furnish tunable and possibly asymmetric superconvergence and ultraconvergence points. We achieve one-order-higher superconvergence for both derivatives and function values, and two-orders-higher ultraconvergence for derivatives--a phenomenon that standard bi-$k$-order finite elements do not exhibit. Derivative ultraconvergence requires three conditions: a diagonal diffusion tensor, zero convection coefficients, and the FVE scheme satisfying tensorial $k$-$k$-order orthogonality (imposed via dual mesh constraints). This two-dimensional derivative ultraconvergence is not a trivial tensor-product extension of the one-dimensional phenomena; its analysis is also considerably more complex due to directional coupling. Theoretically, we introduce the asymmetric-enabled M-decompositions (AMD-Super and AMD-Ultra) to rigorously prove these phenomena. Numerical experiments confirm the theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaDA 1.5: Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization for Large Language Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19223v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), such as LLaDA, present a promising paradigm for language modeling, there has been relatively little effort in aligning these models with human preferences via reinforcement learning. The challenge primarily arises from the high variance in Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)-based likelihood estimates required for preference optimization. To address this issue, we propose Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization (VRPO), a framework that formally analyzes the variance of ELBO estimators and derives bounds on both the bias and variance of preference optimization gradients. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce unbiased variance reduction strategies, including optimal Monte Carlo budget allocation and antithetic sampling, that significantly improve the performance of MDM alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VRPO by applying it to LLaDA, and the resulting model, LLaDA 1.5, outperforms its SFT-only predecessor consistently and significantly across mathematical (GSM8K +4.7), code (HumanEval +3.0, MBPP +1.8), and alignment benchmarks (IFEval +4.0, Arena-Hard +4.3). Furthermore, LLaDA 1.5 demonstrates a highly competitive mathematical performance compared to strong language MDMs and ARMs. Project page: https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-1.5-Demo/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Face Security Vision Foundation Model for Deepfake, Diffusion, and Spoofing Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10663v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable facial representations to boost generalization across various face security tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically, we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training, vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent efficiency-performance trade-off.

| **[HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided Versatile Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03122v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision. However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroSwift: A Lightweight Cross-Subject Framework for fMRI Visual Reconstruction of Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02266v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms. Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

We propose DEMO, a flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable talking-head video synthesis.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[PDE-Transformer: A Continuous Dynamical Systems Approach to Sequence Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03272v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose PDE-Transformer, a novel sequence modeling paradigm that casts the forward pass of a Transformer as the numerical discretization of a continuous reaction-diffusion system derived from a variational energy functional. In our framework, token embeddings evolve under a partial differential equation whose nonlocal integral term models self-attention, local reaction term models feed-forward layers, diffusion term encodes positional smoothing, and a stability control term corresponds to layer normalization. From this unifying perspective, we design an Adaptive PDE Diffusion Layer-an efficient, learnable finite-difference stencil that enforces local smoothness in feature space with linear time complexity and complements self-attention's global routing. Through a systematic theoretical analysis based on four pillars:stability, diffusion geometry, multi-scale dynamics, and component coupling, we derive principled guidelines for integrating the PDE layer at seven candidate points in the Transformer. Empirically, on the Long Range Arena benchmark, placing the layer immediately after embedding yields a 4.1 pp average accuracy gain over a strong baseline, and an adaptive multi-scale variant delivers further improvements. Our work thus offers a principled, lightweight mechanism to bolster long-range dependency modeling by harmonizing continuous PDE smoothing with discrete self-attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProteinAE: Protein Diffusion Autoencoders for Structure Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10634v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling. Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold, rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives, all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective, substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at https://github.com/OnlyLoveKFC/ProteinAE_v1.</p></details> |  |

We embed the atmospheric scattering model into a PDE featuring edge-preserving diffusion and a nonlocal operator to maintain both local details and global structures. A key innovation is an adaptive regularization mechanism guided by the dark channel prior, which adjusts smoothing strength based on haze density. The framework's mathematical well-posedness is rigorously established by proving the existence and uniqueness of its weak solution in $H_0^1(\Omega)$. An efficient, GPU-accelerated fixed-point solver is used for implementation. Experiments confirm our method achieves effective haze removal while preserving high image fidelity, offering a principled alternative to purely data-driven techniques.</p></details> | report |
| **[Injecting Frame-Event Complementary Fusion into Diffusion for Optical Flow in Challenging Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10577v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.</p></details> |  |

Recent acceleration methods enhance the efficiency by exploiting the local sparsity of attention scores; yet they often struggle with accelerating the long-range computation. To address this problem, we propose VORTA, an acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse attention variants. VORTA achieves an end-to-end speedup $1.76\times$ without loss of quality on VBench. Furthermore, it can seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as model caching and step distillation, reaching up to speedup $14.41\times$ with negligible performance degradation.
